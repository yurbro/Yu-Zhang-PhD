MED,19588326,19588326.0,10.1002/14651858.cd001548.pub2,Single dose oral ibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults.,"<h4>Background</h4>This review updates a 1999 Cochrane review showing that ibuprofen at various doses was effective in postoperative pain in single dose studies designed to demonstrate analgesic efficacy. New studies have since been published. Ibuprofen is one of the most widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) analgesics both by prescription and as an over-the-counter medicine. Ibuprofen is used for acute and chronic painful conditions.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess analgesic efficacy of ibuprofen in single oral doses for moderate and severe postoperative pain in adults.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to May 2009.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ibuprofen (any formulation) in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected.<h4>Main results</h4>Seventy-two studies compared ibuprofen and placebo (9186 participants). Studies were predominantly of high reporting quality, and the bulk of the information concerned ibuprofen 200 mg and 400 mg. For at least 50% pain relief compared with placebo the NNT for ibuprofen 200 mg (2690 participants) was 2.7 (2.5 to 3.0) and for ibuprofen 400 mg (6475 participants) it was 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6). The proportion with at least 50% pain relief was 46% with 200 mg and 54% with 400 mg. Remedication within 6 hours was less frequent with higher doses, with 48% remedicating with 200 mg and 42% with 400 mg. The median time to remedication was 4.7 hours with 200 mg and 5.4 hours with 400 mg. Sensitivity analysis indicated that pain model and ibuprofen formulation may both affect the result, with dental impaction models and soluble ibuprofen salts producing better efficacy estimates. Adverse events were uncommon, and not different from placebo.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>The very substantial amount of high quality evidence demonstrates that ibuprofen is an effective analgesic in treating postoperative pain. NNTs for 200 mg and 400 mg ibuprofen did not change significantly from the previous review even when a substantial amount of new information was added. New information is provided on remedication.",2009,,"Derry C, Derry S, Moore RA, McQuay HJ.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001548.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,29182798,29182798.0,10.1002/14651858.cd003976.pub2,Pharmacological interventions for pain relief during orthodontic treatment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pain is a common side effect of orthodontic treatment. It increases in proportion to the amount of force applied to the teeth, and the type of orthodontic appliance used can affect the intensity of the pain. Pain during orthodontic treatment has been shown to be the most common reason for people wanting to discontinue treatment, and has been ranked as the worst aspect of treatment. Although pharmacological methods of pain relief have been investigated, there remains some uncertainty among orthodontists about which painkillers are most suitable and whether pre-emptive analgesia is beneficial. We conducted this Cochrane Review to assess and summarize the international evidence relating to the effectiveness of analgesics for preventing this unwanted side effect associated with orthodontic treatment.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objectives of this review are to determine:- the effectiveness of drug interventions for pain relief during orthodontic treatment; and- whether there is a difference in the analgesic effect provided by different types, forms and doses of analgesia taken during orthodontic treatment.<h4>Search methods</h4>Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 19 June 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 June 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to 19 June 2017) and CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 19 June 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched on the 19 June 2017 for ongoing studies. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relating to pain control during orthodontic treatment. Pain could be measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating scale (NRS) or categorical scale.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently screened the search results, agreed the studies to be included and extracted information from the included studies regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, harms and results. We planned to resolve any discrepancies or disagreements through discussion. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the studies.<h4>Main results</h4>We identified 32 relevant RCTs, which included 3110 participants aged 9 to 34 years, 2348 of whom we were able to include in our analyses. Seventeen of the studies had more than two arms. We were able to use data from 12 trials in meta-analyses that compared analgesics versus control (no treatment or a placebo); nine that compared non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) versus paracetamol; and two that compared pre-emptive versus post-treatment ibuprofen for pain control following orthodontic treatment. One study provided data for the comparison of NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic.We found moderate-quality evidence that analgesics effectively reduced pain following orthodontic treatment when compared to no treatment or a placebo at 2 hours (mean difference (MD) -11.66 mm on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.15 to -7.17; 10 studies, 685 participants), 6 hours (MD -24.27 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -31.44 to -17.11; 9 studies, 535 participants) and 24 hours (MD -21.19 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -28.31 to -14.06; 12 studies, 1012 participants).We did not find any evidence of a difference in efficacy between NSAID and paracetamol at 2, 6 or 24 hours (at 24 hours: MD -0.51, 95% CI -8.93 to 7.92; 9 studies, 734 participants; low-quality evidence).Very low-quality evidence suggested pre-emptive ibuprofen gave better pain relief at 2 hours than ibuprofen taken post treatment (MD -11.30, 95% CI -16.27 to -6.33; one study, 41 participants), however, the difference was no longer significant at 6 or 24 hours.A single study of 48 participants compared topical NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic and showed no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the interventions (very low-quality evidence).Use of rescue analgesia was poorly reported. The very low-quality evidence did not show evidence of a difference between participants taking ibuprofen and participants taking paracetamol (relative risk (RR) 1.5, 95% CI 0.6 to 3.6). Nor did we find evidence of a difference between groups in likelihood of requiring rescue analgesia when ibuprofen was taken pre-emptively compared to after treatment (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.9).Adverse effects were identified in one study, with one participant developing a rash that required treatment with antihistamines. This was provisionally diagnosed as a hypersensitivity to paracetamol.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Analgesics are more effective at reducing pain following orthodontic treatment than placebo or no treatment. Low-quality evidence did not show a difference in effectiveness between systemic NSAIDs compared with paracetamol, or topical NSAIDs compared with local anaesthetic. More high-quality research is needed to investigate these comparisons, and to evaluate pre-emptive versus post-treatment administration of analgesics.",2017,,"Monk AB, Harrison JE, Harrison JE, Worthington HV, Teague A.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003976.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,15654705,15654705.0,10.1002/14651858.cd005115,Rofecoxib for osteoarthritis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Editor's note: The anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market at the end of September 2004 after it was shown that long-term use (greater than 18 months) could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Further information is available at www.vioxx.com. Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease of the joints, characterised by joint pain, stiffness and loss of physical function. Its onset is age-related and occurs usually between the ages of 50 and 60. It is the commonest cause of disability in those aged over 65, with OA of the knee and/or hip affecting over 20 per cent of the elderly population.<h4>Objectives</h4>To establish the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in the management of OA by systematic review of available evidence.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We searched the following databases up to August 2004: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Research Register, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database. The bibliographies of retrieved papers and content experts were consulted for additional references.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. No unpublished RCTs were included in this edition of the review.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. A validated checklist was used to score the quality of the RCTs. Comparable trials were pooled using fixed effects model.<h4>Main results</h4>Twenty-six RCTs were included. The comparators were placebo, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, nimesulide, nabumetone, paracetamol, celecoxib and Arthrotec. The evidence reviewed indicated that rofecoxib was more effective than placebo (patient global response RR 1.75 95% CI: 1.35, 2.26) but was associated with more adverse events (RR 1.32 95% CI 1.11, 1.56). There were no consistent differences in efficacy between rofecoxib and any of the active comparators at equivalent doses. Endoscopic studies indicated that compared to ibuprofen 800 mg three times a day, rofecoxib caused fewer erosions and gastric ulcers at doses of 25mg and 50mg; the difference in duodenal ulcers was evident only at a dose of 25mg. Rofecoxib 50mg also caused more endoscopically observed ulcers greater than rofecoxib 25mg (RR 2.48 CI: 1.21, 5.11). Very few of the trials reported overall rates of GI adverse events although rofecoxib was found to cause fewer GI events than naproxen. Only one of the nine trials comparing rofecoxib to celecoxib reported on the overall rates of GI events and this was a comparison of the higher recommended dose of rofecoxib with the lower recommended dose of celecoxib. Similarly, the three trials in older hypertensive patients that examined the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib used non-comparable doses; the results of these studies indicated that rofecoxib caused more patients to have oedema and a clinically significant increase in systolic blood pressure. This difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib was not evident in studies conducted in more general populations.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in October 2004 therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use. There remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with Cox II selective agents and further work is ongoing.",2005,,"Garner SE, Fidan DD, Frankish R, Maxwell L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8864971,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, have been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual bleeding and pain in women without IUDs.<h4>Objectives</h4>This review summarizes all randomized controlled trials studying use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of bleeding or pain associated with IUD use. Trials of prophylactic use of these drugs around the time of IUD insertion were also included.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We performed searches of PubMed, CENTRAL, POPLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL for relevant trials. We also wrote to the authors of all trials identified to seek other published or unpublished trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included all randomized controlled trials in any language that tested one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment or prevention of bleeding or pain associated with IUD insertion or use.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two authors independently abstracted data from relevant trials, and we entered data into RevMan for analysis.<h4>Main results</h4>We found 15 trials from 10 countries; the total number of participants was 2702. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, suprofen, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, flufenamic acid, alclofenac, and diclofenac) were effective in reducing menstrual blood loss associated with IUD use. This held true for women with and without complaints of heavy bleeding. Similarly, these drugs were effective in reducing pain associated with IUD use. In contrast, prophylactic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had mixed results; studies with ibuprofen found no effect on pain after insertion on IUD discontinuation. No important differences emerged in the one trial comparing the effect of different NSAIDs on bleeding.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce bleeding and pain associated with IUD use. NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if NSAIDs are ineffective, tranexamic acid may be considered as second-line therapy. Prophylactic ibuprofen administration with the first six menses after insertion appears unwarranted.",2006,,"Grimes DA, Hubacher D, Lopez LM, Schulz KF.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8996118,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,36017945,36017945.0,10.1002/14651858.cd006034.pub3,Interventions to prevent or treat heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with intrauterine-device use.,"<h4>Background</h4>Heavy menstrual bleeding and pain are common reasons women discontinue intrauterine device (IUD) use. Copper IUD (Cu IUD) users tend to experience increased menstrual bleeding, whereas levonorgestrel IUD (LNG IUD) users tend to have irregular menstruation. Medical therapies used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with Cu and LNG IUD use include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-fibrinolytics and paracetamol. We analysed treatment and prevention interventions separately because the expected outcomes for treatment and prevention interventions differ. We did not combine different drug classes in the analysis as they have different mechanisms of action. This is an update of a review originally on NSAIDs. The review scope has been widened to include all interventions for treatment or prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with IUD use.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have assessed strategies for treatment and prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with IUD use, for example, pharmacotherapy and alternative therapies.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to January 2021.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs in any language that tested strategies for treatment or prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with IUD (Cu IUD, LNG IUD or other IUD) use. The comparison could be no intervention, placebo or another active intervention.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, and extracted data. Primary outcomes were volume of menstrual blood loss, duration of menstruation and painful menstruation. We used a random-effects model in all meta-analyses. Review authors assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.<h4>Main results</h4>This review includes 21 trials involving 3689 participants from middle- and high-income countries. Women were 18 to 45 years old and either already using an IUD or had just had one placed for contraception. The included trials examined NSAIDs and other interventions. Eleven were treatment trials, of these seven were on users of the Cu IUD, one on LNG IUD and three on an unknown type. Ten were prevention trials, six focused on Cu IUD users, and four on LNG IUD users. Sixteen trials had high risk of detection bias due to subjective assessment of pain and bleeding. Treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding Cu IUD Vitamin B1 resulted in fewer pads used per day (mean difference (MD) -7.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.50 to -5.50) and fewer bleeding days (MD -2.00, 95% CI -2.38 to -1.62; 1 trial; 110 women; low-certainty evidence) compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of naproxen on the volume of menstruation compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.78; 1 trial, 40 women; very low-certainty evidence). Treatment with mefenamic acid resulted in less volume of blood loss compared to tranexamic acid (MD -64.26, 95% CI -105.65 to -22.87; 1 trial, 94 women; low-certainty evidence). However, there was no difference in duration of bleeding with treatment of mefenamic acid or tranexamic acid (MD 0.08 days, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.42, 2 trials, 152 women; low-certainty evidence). LNG IUD The use of ulipristal acetate in LNG IUD may not reduce the number of bleeding days in 90 days in comparison to placebo (MD -9.30 days, 95% CI -26.76 to 8.16; 1 trial, 24 women; low-certainty evidence). Unknown IUD type Mefenamic acid may not reduce volume of bleeding compared to Vitex agnus measured by pictorial blood assessment chart (MD -2.40, 95% CI -13.77 to 8.97; 1 trial; 84 women; low-certainty evidence). Treatment of pain Cu IUD Treatment with tranexamic acid and sodium diclofenac may result in little or no difference in the occurrence of pain (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 17.25; 1 trial, 38 women; very low-certainty evidence). Unknown IUD type Naproxen may reduce pain (MD 4.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 7.29; 1 trial, 33 women; low-certainty evidence). Prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding Cu IUD We found very low-certainty evidence that tolfenamic acid may prevent heavy bleeding compared to placebo (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85; 1 trial, 310 women). There was no difference between ibuprofen and placebo in blood volume reduction (MD -14.11, 95% CI -36.04 to 7.82) and duration of bleeding (MD -0.2 days, 95% CI -1.40 to 1.0; 1 trial, 28 women, low-certainty evidence). Aspirin may not prevent heavy bleeding in comparison to paracetamol (MD -0.30, 95% CI -26.16 to 25.56; 1 trial, 20 women; very low-certainty evidence). LNG IUD Ulipristal acetate may increase the percentage of bleeding days compared to placebo (MD 9.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 17.52; 1 trial, 118 women; low-certainty evidence). There were insufficient data for analysis in a single trial comparing mifepristone and vitamin B. There were insufficient data for analysis in the single trial comparing tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid and in another trial comparing naproxen with estradiol. Prevention of pain Cu IUD There was low-certainty evidence that tolfenamic acid may not be effective to prevent painful menstruation compared to placebo (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.14; 1 trial, 310 women). Ibuprofen may not reduce menstrual cramps compared to placebo (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 8.95; 1 trial, 20 women, low-certainty evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Findings from this review should be interpreted with caution due to low- and very low-certainty evidence. Included trials were limited; the majority of the evidence was derived from single trials with few participants. Further research requires larger trials and improved trial reporting. The use of vitamin B1 and mefenamic acid to treat heavy menstruation and tolfenamic acid to prevent heavy menstruation associated with Cu IUD should be investigated. More trials are needed to generate evidence for the treatment and prevention of heavy and painful menstruation associated with LNG IUD.",2022,,"Christelle K, Norhayati MN, Jaafar SH.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9413853,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Dexketoprofen is the (S)-enantiomer, which is believed to confer analgesia. Theoretically dexketoprofen is expected to provide equivalent analgesia to ketoprofen at half the dose, with a consequent reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess efficacy, duration of action, and associated adverse events of single dose oral ketoprofen and dexketoprofen in acute postoperative pain in adults.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to August 2009.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ketoprofen and dexketoprofen in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was collected.<h4>Main results</h4>Fourteen studies compared ketoprofen (968 participants) at mainly 25 mg and 50 mg with placebo (520 participants). Seven studies compared dexketoprofen (681 participants) at mainly 10 mg to 25 mg with placebo (289 participants). Studies were of adequate reporting quality, and participants had pain following dental, orthopaedic, obstetric, gynaecological and general surgery. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity between studies in dental and other types of surgery, particularly bunionectomy, which limited analysis.Ketoprofen at doses between 12.5 mg and 100 mg produced NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours of 2.4 to 3.3. For dental studies only there was a trend to more efficacy at higher doses, with NNT decreasing from 2.4 at 12.5 mg to 1.6 at 100 mg. Dexketoprofen at doses of 10/12.5 mg and 20/25 mg produced NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours of 3.2 and 3.6, with no obvious dose response. Significantly fewer participants used rescue medication with ketoprofen and dexketoprofen than placebo. The median time to remedication was about 5 hours with ketoprofen and 4 hours with dexketoprofen. The expected equivalent efficacy with a half dose of dexketoprofen compared to ketoprofen was not demonstrated.Adverse events were uncommon with both drugs, and not significantly different from placebo.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Ketoprofen at doses of 25 mg to 100 mg is an effective analgesic in moderate to severe acute postoperative pain with an NNT for at least 50% pain relief of 3.3 with a 50 mg dose. This is similar to that of commonly used NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (NNT 2.5 for 400 mg dose) and diclofenac (NNT 2.7 at 50 mg dose). Duration of action is about 5 hours. Dexketoprofen is also effective with NNTs of 3.2 to 3.6 in the dose range 10 mg to 25 mg. Both drugs were well tolerated in single doses.",2009,,"Barden J, Derry S, McQuay HJ, Moore RA.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4171124?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ketoprofen is a non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat acute and chronic painful conditions. Dexketoprofen is the (S)-enantiomer, which is believed to confer analgesia. Theoretically dexketoprofen is expected to provide equivalent analgesia to ketoprofen at half the dose, with a consequent reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events. This review is one of a series on oral analgesics for acute postoperative pain. Individual reviews have been brought together in two overviews to provide information about the relative efficacy and harm of the different interventions.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the efficacy and safety of single dose oral ketoprofen and oral dexketoprofen compared with placebo for acute postoperative pain, using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in the same way, and criteria of efficacy recommended by an in-depth study at the individual patient level.<h4>Search methods</h4>For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from 2009 to 28 March 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and two online clinical trial registries.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ketoprofen or dexketoprofen in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently considered studies for inclusion in the review, examined issues of study quality and potential bias, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ketoprofen and dexketoprofen, compared with placebo, where there were sufficient data. We collected information on the number of participants with at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over six hours, the median time to use of rescue medication, and the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication. We also collected information on adverse events and withdrawals. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE, and created 'Summary of findings' tables.<h4>Main results</h4>This updated review included 24 studies; six additional studies added 1001 participants involved in comparisons of ketoprofen or dexketoprofen and placebo, with a 12% increase in participants taking ketoprofen and a 65% increase for dexketoprofen. Most participants (70%) were women. Dental studies typically involved young participants (mean age 20 to 30 years); other types of surgery involved older participants (mean age 37 to 68 years). Overall, we judged the studies at high risk of bias only for small size, which can lead to an overestimation of benefit.Ketoprofen doses ranged between 6.5 mg and 150 mg. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with the usual ketoprofen oral dose of 50 mg was 57%, compared to 23% with placebo, giving an NNT of 2.9 (95% CI 2.4 to 3.7) (RR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1; 594 participants; 8 studies; high quality evidence). Efficacy was significantly better in dental studies (NNT 1.8) than other surgery (NNT 4.2). The proportion of participants using rescue medication within six hours was lower with ketoprofen (32%) than with placebo (75%), giving a number needed to treat to prevent use of rescue medication (NNTp) of 2.3 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.1); 263 participants; 4 studies; high quality evidence). Median time to remedication estimates were poorly reported. Reports of any adverse event were similar with ketoprofen (18%) and placebo (11%) (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.8; 342 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events (very low quality evidence).Dexketoprofen doses ranged between 5 mg and 100 mg. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with the usual dexketoprofen oral dose of 20 mg or 25 mg was 52%, compared to 27% with placebo, giving an NNT of 4.1 (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2) (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2; 1177 participants; 8 studies; high quality evidence). Efficacy was significantly better in dental studies (NNT 2.7) than other surgery (NNT 5.7). The proportion of participants using rescue medication within six hours was lower with dexketoprofen (47%) than placebo (69%), giving an NNTp of 4.7 (95% CI 3.3 to 8.0); 445 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). Median time to remedication estimates were poorly reported. Reports of any adverse event were similar with dexketoprofen (14%) and placebo (10%) (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.2; 536 participants, 6 studies; high quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events (very low quality evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Ketoprofen at doses of 25 mg to 100 mg is an effective analgesic in moderate to severe acute postoperative pain with an NNT for at least 50% pain relief of 2.9 with a 50 mg dose. This is similar to that of commonly used NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (NNT 2.5 for 400 mg dose) and diclofenac (NNT 2.7 for 50 mg dose).

It is characterised by the development of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is the most common cause of pelvic pain in women. This endometrial tissue development is dependent on oestrogen produced primarily by the ovaries and, therefore, traditional management has focused on suppression of ovarian function. Mounting evidence shows that altered immune function plays a crucial role in the genesis and development of endometriosis. In this review we considered modulation of the inflammation as an alternative approach.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the effectiveness and safety of anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) treatment in the management of endometriosis in premenopausal women.<h4>Search methods</h4>For the first publication of this review, we searched for trials in the following databases (from their inception to August 2009): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. In addition, we searched all reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field in an attempt to locate trials. We reran this search to 3 September 2012 for this update.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-TNF-α drugs with placebo, no treatment, medical treatment, or surgery for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis were included.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using data extraction forms. The domains assessed for risk of bias were sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. We used risk ratios (RR) for reporting dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI), whilst we expressed continuous data as mean differences (MD). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic.<h4>Main results</h4>Only one trial involving 21 participants was included. The results showed no evidence of an effect of infliximab, one of the known anti-TNF-α drugs, on pelvic pain reduction using the Biberoglu-Behrman (BB) score (0 to 3 scale) for participants (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.15), the BB score for clinicians (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.11), or a visual analogue pain score (VAS, 100 mm scale) (MD -5.60, 95% CI -16.10 to 4.90), or on the use of pain killers (ibuprofen, g/day) (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.10). There was no evidence of an increase in adverse events in the infliximab group compared with placebo (RR 3.73, 95% CI 0.22 to 63.66). We found no evidence of clinical benefits of infliximab for endometriotic lesions, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, or pelvic tenderness. To date, there is no trial that has reported a cost-effectiveness analysis of anti-TNF-α drugs, or the odds of recurrence.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>This review was updated in 2012. The results of the original review published in 2010 remain unchanged. There is still not enough evidence to support the use of anti-TNF-α drugs in the management of women with endometriosis for the relief of pelvic pain.",2013,,"Lu D, Song H, Shi G.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008088.pub3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,24174375,24174375.0,10.1002/14651858.cd009572.pub2,Combined and alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen therapy for febrile children.,"<h4>Background</h4>Health professionals frequently recommend fever treatment regimens for children that either combine paracetamol and ibuprofen or alternate them. However, there is uncertainty about whether these regimens are better than the use of single agents, and about the adverse effect profile of combination regimens.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effects and side effects of combining paracetamol and ibuprofen, or alternating them on consecutive treatments, compared with monotherapy for treating fever in children.<h4>Search methods</h4>In September 2013, we searched Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2009-2011).<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized controlled trials comparing alternating or combined paracetamol and ibuprofen regimens with monotherapy in children with fever.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>One review author and two assistants independently screened the searches and applied inclusion criteria. Two authors assessed risk of bias and graded the evidence independently. We conducted separate analyses for different comparison groups (combined therapy versus monotherapy, alternating therapy versus monotherapy, combined therapy versus alternating therapy).<h4>Main results</h4>Six studies, enrolling 915 participants, are included.Compared to giving a single antipyretic alone, giving combined paracetamol and ibuprofen to febrile children can result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after treatment (MD -0.27 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08, two trials, 163 participants, moderate quality evidence). If no further antipyretics are given, combined treatment probably also results in a lower mean temperature at four hours (MD -0.70 °Celsius, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.35, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence), and in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for at least four hours after treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.42, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence). Only one trial assessed a measure of child discomfort (fever associated symptoms at 24 hours and 48 hours), but did not find a significant difference in this measure between the treatment regimens (one trial, 156 participants, evidence quality not graded).In practice, caregivers are often advised to initially give a single agent (paracetamol or ibuprofen), and then give a further dose of the alternative if the child's fever fails to resolve or recurs. Giving alternating treatment in this way may result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after the second dose (MD -0.60 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.26, two trials, 78 participants, low quality evidence), and may also result in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for up to three hours after it is given (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55, two trials, 109 participants, low quality evidence). One trial assessed child discomfort (mean pain scores at 24, 48 and 72 hours), finding that these mean scores were lower, with alternating therapy, despite fewer doses of antipyretic being given overall (one trial, 480 participants, low quality evidence)Only one small trial compared alternating therapy with combined therapy. No statistically significant differences were seen in mean temperature, or the number of febrile children at one, four or six hours (one trial, 40 participants, very low quality evidence).There were no serious adverse events in the trials that were directly attributed to the medications used.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is some evidence that both alternating and combined antipyretic therapy may be more effective at reducing temperatures than monotherapy alone. However, the evidence for improvements in measures of child discomfort remains inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence to know which of combined or alternating therapy might be more beneficial.Future research needs to measure child discomfort using standardized tools, and assess the safety of combined and alternating antipyretic therapy.",2013,,"Wong T, Stang AS, Ganshorn H, Hartling L, Maconochie IK, Thomsen AM, Johnson DW.",https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009572.pub2/pdf/full,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,28653390,28653390.0,10.1002/14651858.cd009761.pub2,Interventions for preventing high altitude illness: Part 1. Commonly-used classes of drugs.,"<h4>Background</h4>High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (8202 feet). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly-used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus-based and free-text terms to search.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized-controlled and cross-over trials conducted in any setting where commonly-used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty-four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly-used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants)The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I<sup>2</sup> = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants)Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants)For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Our assessment of the most commonly-used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.",2017,,"Nieto Estrada VH, Molano Franco D, Medina RD, Gonzalez Garay AG, Martí-Carvajal AJ, Arevalo-Rodriguez I.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6481751?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A PDA can be treated surgically; or medically with one of two prostaglandin inhibitors, indomethacin or ibuprofen. Case reports suggest that paracetamol may be an alternative for the closure of a PDA. An association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to paracetamol and later development of autism or autism spectrum disorder has been reported.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the effectiveness and safety of intravenous or oral paracetamol compared with placebo or no intervention, intravenous indomethacin, intravenous or oral ibuprofen, or with other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors for treatment of an echocardiographically diagnosed PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 6 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 6 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 6 November 2017). We searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs in which paracetamol was compared to no intervention, placebo or other agents used for closure of PDA irrespective of dose, duration and mode of administration in preterm (≤ 34 weeks' postmenstrual age) infants. We both reviewed the search results and made a final selection of potentially eligible articles by discussion. We included studies of both prophylactic and therapeutic use of paracetamol.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for the following outcomes when data were available: failure of ductal closure after the first course of treatment; neurodevelopmental impairment; all-cause mortality during initial hospital stay (death); gastrointestinal bleed or stools positive for occult blood; and serum levels of creatinine after treatment (µmol/L).<h4>Main results</h4>We included eight studies that reported on 916 infants. One of these studies compared paracetamol to both ibuprofen and indomethacin. Five studies compared treatment of PDA with paracetamol versus ibuprofen and enrolled 559 infants. There was no significant difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for failure of ductal closure after the first course of drug administration (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.21; typical risk difference (RD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09); I² = 0% for RR and RD; moderate quality of evidence. Four studies (n = 537) reported on gastrointestinal bleed which was lower in the paracetamol group versus the ibuprofen group (typical RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.69; typical RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.02); I² = 0% for RR and RD; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 17 (95% CI 11 to 50); moderate quality of evidence. The serum levels of creatinine were lower in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group in four studies (moderate quality of evidence), as were serum bilirubin levels following treatment in two studies (n = 290). Platelet counts and daily urine output were higher in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group. One study reported on long-term follow-up to 18 to 24 months of age following treatment with paracetamol versus ibuprofen. There were no significant differences in the neurological outcomes at 18 to 24 months (n = 61); (low quality of evidence).Two studies compared prophylactic administration of paracetamol for a PDA with placebo or no intervention in 80 infants. Paracetamol resulted in a lower rate of failure of ductal closure after 4 to 5 days of treatment compared to placebo or no intervention which was of borderline significance for typical RR 0.49 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.00; P = 0.05); but significant for typical RD -0.21 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.02); I² = 0 % for RR and RD; NNTB 5 (95% CI 2 to 50); (low quality of evidence).Two studies (n = 277) compared paracetamol with indomethacin. There was no significant difference in the failure to close a PDA (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.65; I² = 11%; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.08; I² = 17%) (low quality of evidence). Serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in the paracetamol group compared with the indomethacin group and platelet counts and daily urine output were significantly higher in the paracetamol group.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Moderate-quality evidence according to GRADE suggests that paracetamol is as effective as ibuprofen; low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol to be more effective than placebo or no intervention; and low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA. There was no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome in children exposed to paracetamol compared to ibuprofen; however the quality of evidence is low and comes from only one study. In view of concerns raised regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal and postnatal exposure to paracetamol, long-term follow-up to at least 18 to 24 months' postnatal age must be incorporated in any studies of paracetamol in the newborn population. At least 19 ongoing trials have been registered.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have suggested that paracetamol may be an effective and safe agent for the closure of a PDA.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the efficacy and safety of paracetamol as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy via any route of administration, compared with placebo, no intervention, or another prostaglandin inhibitor, for prophylaxis or treatment of an echocardiographically-diagnosed PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trials registers on 13 October 2021, and one other database on 1 March 2022. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs in which paracetamol (single-agent or combination therapy) was compared to no intervention, placebo, or other agents used for closure of PDA, irrespective of dose, duration, and mode of administration in preterm infants. Two independent authors reviewed the search results and made a final selection of potentially eligible articles through discussion.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: failure of ductal closure after the first course of treatment; all-cause mortality during initial hospital stay; and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).<h4>Main results</h4>For this update, we included 27 studies enrolling 2278 infants. We considered the overall risk of bias in the 27 studies to vary from low to unclear. We identified 24 ongoing studies. Paracetamol versus ibuprofen There was probably little to no difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for failure of ductal closure after the first course (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.18; 18 studies, 1535 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was likely little to no difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.48; 8 studies, 734 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and for NEC (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.94; 10 studies, 1015 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Paracetamol versus indomethacin There was little to no difference between paracetamol and indomethacin for failure of ductal closure after the first course (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.33; 4 studies, 380 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between paracetamol and indomethacin for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.92; 2 studies, 114 infants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of NEC may be lower in the paracetamol group (3.7%) versus the indomethacin group(9.2%) (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96; 4 studies, 384 infants; low-certainty evidence). Prophylactic paracetamol versus placebo/no intervention Prophylactic paracetamol (17%) compared to placebo/no intervention (61%) may reduce failure of ductal closure after one course (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42; 3 studies, 240 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between prophylactic paracetamol and placebo/no intervention for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.44; 3 studies, 240 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on NEC. Early paracetamol treatment versus placebo/no intervention Early paracetamol treatment (28%) compared to placebo/no intervention (79%) may reduce failure of ductal closure after one course when used before 14 days' postnatal age (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53; 2 studies, 127 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on all-cause mortality during hospital stay or NEC. Late paracetamol treatment versus placebo/no intervention There was little to no difference between late paracetamol and placebo for failure of ductal closure after one course of treatment when used at or after 14 days' postnatal age (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence) or NEC (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.76; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for all-cause mortality during hospital stay. Paracetamol combined with ibuprofen versus ibuprofen combined with placebo or no intervention There was little to no difference between paracetamol plus ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen plus placebo or no intervention for failure of ductal closure after the first course (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 2 studies, 111 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between paracetamol plus ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen plus placebo or no intervention for NEC (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.45; 1 study, 24 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for all-cause mortality during hospital stay. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and ibuprofen; low-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and indomethacin; low-certainty evidence suggests that prophylactic paracetamol may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; low-certainty evidence suggests that early paracetamol treatment may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; low-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference between late paracetamol treatment and placebo, and probably little or no difference in effectiveness between the combination of paracetamol plus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen alone for the closure of PDA after the first course of treatment. The majority of neonates included in these studies were of moderate preterm gestation. Thus, establishing the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for PDA treatment in extremely low birth weight (ELBW: birth weight < 1000 grams) and extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs < 28 weeks' gestation) requires further studies.",2022,,"Jasani B, Mitra S, Shah PS.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010061.pub5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,23728701,23728701.0,10.1002/14651858.cd010538,Topical herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Before extraction and synthetic chemistry were invented, musculoskeletal complaints were treated with preparations from medicinal plants. They were either administered orally or topically. In contrast to the oral medicinal plant products, topicals act in part as counterirritants or are toxic when given orally.<h4>Objectives</h4>To update the previous Cochrane review of herbal therapy for osteoarthritis from 2000 by evaluating the evidence on effectiveness for topical medicinal plant products.<h4>Search methods</h4>Databases for mainstream and complementary medicine were searched using terms to include all forms of arthritis combined with medicinal plant products. We searched electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform) to February 2013, unrestricted by language. We also searched the reference lists from retrieved trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials of herbal interventions used topically, compared with inert (placebo) or active controls, in people with osteoarthritis were included.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data.<h4>Main results</h4>Seven studies (six different medicinal plant interventions; 785 participants) were included. Single studies (five studies) and non-comparable studies (two studies) precluded pooling of results.Moderate evidence from a single study of 174 people with hand osteoarthritis indicated that treatment with Arnica extract gel probably results in similar benefits as treatment with ibuprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) with a similar number of adverse events. Mean pain in the ibuprofen group was 44.2 points on a 100 point scale; treatment with Arnica gel reduced the pain by 4 points after three weeks: mean difference (MD) -3.8 points (95% confidence intervals (CI) -10.1 to 2.5), absolute reduction 4% (10% reduction to 3% increase). Hand function was 7.5 points on a 30 point scale in the ibuprofen-treated group; treatment with Arnica gel reduced function by 0.4 points (MD -0.4, 95% CI -1.75 to 0.95), absolute improvement 1% (6% improvement to 3% decline)). Total adverse events were higher in the Arnica gel group (13% compared to 8% in the ibuprofen group): relative risk (RR) 1.65 (95% CI 0.72 to 3.76).Moderate quality evidence from a single trial of 99 people with knee osteoarthritis indicated that compared with placebo, Capsicum extract gel probably does not improve pain or knee function, and is commonly associated with treatment-related adverse events including skin irritation and a burning sensation. At four weeks follow-up, mean pain in the placebo group was 46 points on a 100 point scale; treatment with Capsicum extract reduced pain by 1 point (MD -1, 95% CI -6.8 to 4.8), absolute reduction of 1% (7% reduction to 5% increase). Mean knee function in the placebo group was 34.8 points on a 96 point scale at four weeks; treatment with Capsicum extract improved function by a mean of 2.6 points (MD -2.6, 95% CI -9.5 to 4.2), an absolute improvement of 3% (10% improvement to 4% decline). Adverse event rates were greater in the Capsicum extract group (80% compared with 20% in the placebo group, rate ratio 4.12, 95% CI 3.30 to 5.17). The number needed to treat to result in adverse events was 2 (95% CI 1 to 2).Moderate evidence from a single trial of 220 people with knee osteoarthritis suggested that comfrey extract gel probably improves pain without increasing adverse events. At three weeks, the mean pain in the placebo group was 83.5 points on a 100 point scale. Treatment with comfrey reduced pain by a mean of 41.5 points (MD -41.5, 95% CI -48 to -34), an absolute reduction of 42% (34% to 48% reduction). Function was not reported. Adverse events were similar: 6% (7/110) reported adverse events in the comfrey group compared with 14% (15/110) in the placebo group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.10).Although evidence from a single trial indicated that adhesive patches containing Chinese herbal mixtures FNZG and SJG may improve pain and function, the clinical applicability of these findings are uncertain because participants were only treated and followed up for seven days. We are also uncertain if other topical herbal products (Marhame-Mafasel compress, stinging nettle leaf) improve osteoarthritis symptoms due to the very low quality evidence from single trials.No serious side effects were reported.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Although the mechanism of action of the topical medicinal plant products provides a rationale basis for their use in the treatment of osteoarthritis, the quality and quantity of current research studies of effectiveness are insufficient. Arnica gel probably improves symptoms as effectively as a gel containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, but with no better (and possibly worse) adverse event profile. Comfrey extract gel probably improves pain, and Capsicum extract gel probably will not improve pain or function at the doses examined in this review. Further high quality, fully powered studies are required to confirm the trends of effectiveness identifed in studies so far.",2013,,"Cameron M, Chrubasik S.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010538,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Acupuncture and other methods that stimulate acupuncture points, such as electroacupuncture, auricular acupuncture, laser acupuncture, moxibustion, and acupressure, are used in treating CTS. Acupuncture has been recommended as a potentially useful treatment for CTS, but its effectiveness remains uncertain. We used Cochrane methodology to assess the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised trials of acupuncture for symptoms in people with CTS.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture and acupuncture-related interventions compared to sham or active treatments for the management of pain and other symptoms of CTS in adults.<h4>Search methods</h4>On 13 November 2017, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, DARE, HTA, and NHS EED. In addition, we searched six Korean medical databases, and three Chinese medical databases from inception to 30 April 2018. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials examining the effects of acupuncture and related interventions on the symptoms of CTS in adults. Eligible studies specified diagnostic criteria for CTS. We included outcomes measured at least three weeks after randomisation. The included studies compared acupuncture and related interventions to placebo/sham treatments, or to active interventions, such as steroid nerve blocks, oral steroid, splints, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), surgery and physical therapy.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>The review authors followed standard Cochrane methods.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 12 studies with 869 participants. Ten studies reported the primary outcome of overall clinical improvement at short-term follow-up (3 months or less) after randomisation. Most studies could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity, and all had an unclear or high overall risk of bias.Seven studies provided information on adverse events. Non-serious adverse events included skin bruising with electroacupuncture and local pain after needle insertion. No serious adverse events were reported.One study (N = 41) comparing acupuncture to sham/placebo reported change on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) at three months after treatment (mean difference (MD) -0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.79 to 0.33) and the BCTQ Functional Status Scale (FSS) (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.63), with no clear difference between interventions; the evidence was of low certainty. The only dropout was due to painful acupuncture. Another study of acupuncture versus placebo/sham acupuncture (N = 111) provided no usable data.Two studies assessed laser acupuncture versus sham laser acupuncture. One study (N = 60), which was at low risk of bias, provided low-certainty evidence of a better Global Symptom Scale (GSS) score with active treatment at four weeks after treatment (MD 7.46, 95% CI 4.71 to 10.22; range of possible GSS scores is 0 to 50) and a higher response rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.22). No serious adverse events were reported in either group. The other study (N = 25) did not assess overall symptom improvement.One trial (N = 77) of conventional acupuncture versus oral corticosteroids provided very low-certainty evidence of greater improvement in GSS score (scale 0 to 50) at 13 months after treatment with acupuncture (MD 8.25, 95% CI 4.12 to 12.38) and a higher responder rate (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.45). Change in GSS at two weeks or four weeks after treatment showed no clear difference between groups. Adverse events occurred in 18% of the oral corticosteroid group and 5% of the acupuncture group (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.32). One study comparing electroacupuncture and oral corticosteroids reported a clinically insignificant difference in change in BCTQ score at four weeks after treatment (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.10; N = 52).Combined data from two studies comparing the responder rate with acupuncture versus vitamin B<sub>12,</sub> produced a RR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.36; N = 100, very low-certainty evidence). No serious adverse events occurred in either group.One study of conventional acupuncture versus ibuprofen in which all participants wore night splints found very low-certainty evidence of a lower symptom score on the SSS of the BCTQ with acupuncture (MD -5.80, 95% CI -7.95 to -3.65; N = 50) at one month after treatment. Five people had adverse events with ibuprofen and none with acupuncture.One study of electroacupuncture versus night splints found no clear difference between the groups on the SSS of the BCTQ (MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.43; N = 60; very low-certainty evidence). Six people had adverse events with electroacupuncture and none with splints. One study of electroacupuncture plus night splints versus night splints alone presented no difference between the groups on the SSS of the BCTQ at 17 weeks (MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.04; N = 181, low-certainty evidence). No serious adverse events occurred in either group.One study comparing acupuncture plus NSAIDs and vitamins versus NSAIDs and vitamins alone showed no clear difference on the BCTQ SSS at four weeks (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.46; very low-certainty evidence). There was no reporting on adverse events.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Acupuncture and laser acupuncture may have little or no effect in the short term on symptoms of CTS in comparison with placebo or sham acupuncture. It is uncertain whether acupuncture and related interventions are more or less effective in relieving symptoms of CTS than corticosteroid nerve blocks, oral corticosteroids, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, ibuprofen, splints, or when added to NSAIDs plus vitamins, as the certainty of any conclusions from the evidence is low or very low and most evidence is short term. The included studies covered diverse interventions, had diverse designs, limited ethnic diversity, and clinical heterogeneity. High-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to rigorously assess the effects of acupuncture and related interventions upon symptoms of CTS. Based on moderate to very-low certainty evidence, acupuncture was associated with no serious adverse events, or reported discomfort, pain, local paraesthesia and temporary skin bruises, but not all studies provided adverse event data.",2018,,"Choi GH, Wieland LS, Lee H, Sim H, Lee MS, Shin BC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6361189,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pain from middle ear infection and pressure behind the eardrum is the key symptom of AOM. Ear pain is central to children's and parents' experience of the illness. Because antibiotics provide only marginal benefits, analgesic treatment including paracetamol (acetaminophen) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is regarded as the cornerstone of AOM management in children.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of paracetamol (acetaminophen) or NSAIDs, alone or combined, compared with placebo or no treatment in relieving pain in children with AOM. Our secondary objective was to assess the effectiveness of NSAIDs compared with paracetamol in children with AOM.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 7, July 2016; MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to August 2016), Embase (from 1947 to August 2016), CINAHL (from 1981 to August 2016), LILACS (from 1982 to August 2016) and Web of Science (from 1955 to August 2016) for published trials. We screened reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional trials. We searched WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR) for completed and ongoing trials (search date 19 August 2016).<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, for pain relief in children with AOM. We also included trials of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, for children with fever or upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) if we were able to extract subgroup data on pain relief in children with AOM either directly or after obtaining additional data from study authors.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the included trials and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence for each outcome of interest.<h4>Main results</h4>We included three RCTs (327 children) which were assessed at low to moderate risk of bias.One RCT included 219 children with AOM, and used a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind design to compare paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus placebo. All children also received antibiotics and those with fever > 39 °C could have received paracetamol (30 mg to 60 mg) additionally to the studied treatments.Another RCT involved 156 febrile children (26 of whom had AOM). The study design was a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind design and compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol.The third RCT included 889 children with respiratory tract infections (82 of whom had AOM). This study applied a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial, open-label design and compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol. Study participants were randomised to one of the three treatment groups as well as two dosing groups (regular versus as required) and two steam inhalation groups (steam versus no steam).Authors of two RCTs provided crude subgroup data on children with AOM. We used data from the remaining trial to inform comparison of paracetamol versus placebo (148 children) and ibuprofen versus placebo (146 children) assessments. Data from all included RCTs informed comparison of ibuprofen versus paracetamol (183 children); data from the two RCTs informed comparison of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone (71 children).We found evidence, albeit of low quality, that both paracetamol and ibuprofen as monotherapies were more effective than placebo in relieving pain at 48 hours (paracetamol versus placebo: proportion of children with pain 10% versus 25%, RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 7; ibuprofen versus placebo: proportion of children with pain 7% versus 25%, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Very low quality evidence suggested that adverse events did not significantly differ between children treated with either paracetamol, ibuprofen or placebo.We found insufficient evidence of a difference between ibuprofen and paracetamol in relieving ear pain at 24 hours (2 RCTs, 39 children; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.18; very low quality evidence), 48 to 72 hours (3 RCTs, 183 children; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.54; low quality evidence) and four to seven days (2 RCTs, 38 children; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.23; very low quality evidence).Data on the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone came from two RCTs that provided crude subgroup data for 71 children with AOM. The small sample provided imprecise effect estimates and we were consequently unable to draw any firm conclusions (very low quality evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Despite explicit guideline recommendations on its use, current evidence on the effectiveness of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, in relieving pain in children with AOM is limited. Low quality evidence indicates that both paracetamol and ibuprofen as monotherapies are more effective than placebo in relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM. There is insufficient evidence of a difference between ibuprofen and paracetamol in relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM, whereas data on the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone were insufficient to draw any firm conclusions.

MED,26863524,26863524.0,10.1002/14651858.cd012087,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Chronic back pain is an important health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to treat people with low back pain, especially people with acute back pain. Short term NSAID use is also recommended for pain relief in people with chronic back pain. Two types of NSAIDs are available and used to treat back pain: non-selective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 NSAIDs. In 2008, a Cochrane review identified a small but significant effect from NSAIDs compared to placebo in people with chronic back pain. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2008 and focuses on people with chronic low back pain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine if NSAIDs are more efficacious than various comparison treatments for non-specific chronic low back pain and if so, which type of NSAID is most efficacious.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and two clinical trials registry databases up to 24 June 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, German or Dutch. We also screened references cited in relevant reviews.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs (double-blind and single-blind) of NSAIDs used to treat people with chronic low back pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion in this Cochrane review according to the inclusion criteria. One review author extracted the data, and a second review author checked the data. Two review authors independently evaluated the risk of bias of all included trials. If data were clinically homogeneous, we performed a meta-analysis and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 13 trials in this Cochrane review. Ten studies were at 'low' risk of bias. Six studies compared NSAIDs with placebo, and included 1354 participants in total. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo, with a mean difference in pain intensity score from baseline of -3.30 (95% CI -5.33 to -1.27) on a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (VAS) with a median follow-up of 56 days (interquartile range (IQR) 13 to 91 days). Four studies measured disability using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo on disability, with a mean difference from baseline of -0.85 (95% CI -1.30 to -0.40) on a scale from 0 to 24 with a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR 42 to 105 days). All six placebo controlled studies also reported adverse events, and suggested that adverse events are not statistically significant more frequent in participants using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17). Due to the relatively small sample size and relatively short follow-up in most included trials, it is likely that the proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event is underestimated.Two studies compared different types of non-selective NSAIDs, namely ibuprofen versus diclofenac and piroxicam versus indomethacin. The trials did not find any differences between these NSAID types, but both trials had small sample sizes. One trial reported no differences in pain intensity between treatment groups that used selective or non-selective NSAIDs. One other trial compared diflunisal with paracetamol and showed no difference in improvement from baseline on pain intensity score. One trial showed a better global improvement in favour of celecoxib versus tramadol.One included trial compared NSAIDs with 'home-based exercise'. Disability improved more in participants who did exercises versus participants receiving NSAIDs, but pain scores were similar.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Six of the 13 included RCTs showed that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo regarding pain intensity. NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo regarding disability. However, the magnitude of the effects is small, and the level of evidence was low. When we only included RCTs at low risk of bias, differences in effect between NSAIDs and placebo were reduced. We identified no difference in efficacy between different NSAID types, including selective versus non-selective NSAIDs.

MED,28597983,28597983.0,10.1002/14651858.cd012095.pub2,Celecoxib for rheumatoid arthritis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic auto-immune disorder that causes widespread and persistent inflammation of the synovial lining of joints and tendon sheaths. Presently, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment focuses on managing symptoms such as pain, stiffness and mobility, with the aim of achieving stable remission and improving mobility. Celecoxib is a selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the benefits and harms of celecoxib in people with rheumatoid arthritis.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal) to May 18, 2017. We also searched the reference and citation lists of included studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral celecoxib (200 mg and 400 mg daily) versus no intervention, placebo or a traditional NSAID (tNSAID) in people with confirmed rheumatoid arthritis, of any age and either sex. We excluded studies with fewer than 50 participants in each arm or had durations of fewer than four weeks treatment.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.<h4>Main results</h4>We included eight RCTs with durations of 4 to 24 weeks, published between 1998 and 2014 that involved a total of 3988 adults (mean age = 54 years), most of whom were women (73%). Participants had rheumatoid arthritis for an average of 9.2 years. All studies were assessed at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, evidence was assessed as moderate-to-low quality. Five studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Celecoxib versus placeboWe included two studies (N = 873) in which participants received 200 mg daily or 400 mg daily or placebo. Participants who received celecoxib showed significant clinical improvement compared with those receiving placebo (15% absolute improvement; 95% CI 7% to 25%; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.86; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 7, 95% CI 5 to 13; 2 studies, 873 participants; moderate to low quality evidence).Participants who received celecoxib reported less pain than placebo-treated people (11% absolute improvement; 95% CI 8% to 14%; NNTB = 4, 95% CI 3 to 6; 1 study, 706 participants) but results were inconclusive for improvement in physical function (MD -0.10, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.10; 1 study, 706 participants).In the celecoxib group, 15/293 participants developed ulcers, compared with 4/99 in the placebo group (Peto OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.63; 1 study, 392 participants; low quality evidence). Nine (of 475) participants in the celecoxib group developed short-term serious adverse events, compared with five (of 231) in the placebo group (Peto OR 0.87 (0.28 to 2.69; 1 study, 706 participants; low quality evidence).There were fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (163/475) compared with placebo (130/231) (22% absolute change; 95% CI 16% to 27%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72; 1 study, 706 participants).Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) were not reported. However, regulatory agencies warn of increased cardiovascular event risk associated with celecoxib. Celecoxib versus tNSAIDsSeven studies (N = 2930) compared celecoxib and tNSAIDs (amtolmetin guacyl, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, pelubiprofen); one study included comparisons of both placebo and tNSAIDs (N = 1149).There was a small improvement, which may not be clinically significant, in numbers of participants achieving ACR20 criteria response in the celecoxib group compared to tNSAIDs (4% absolute improvement; 95% CI 0% less improvement to 8% more improvement; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; 4 studies, 1981 participants). There was a lack of evidence of difference between participants in the celecoxib and tNSAID groups in terms of pain or physical function. Results were assessed at moderate-to-low quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency).People who received celecoxib had a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers ≥ 3 mm (34/870) compared with those who received tNSAIDs (116/698). This corresponded to 12% absolute change (95% CI 11% to 13%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.32; 5 studies, 1568 participants; moderate quality evidence). There were 7% fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (95% CI 4% to 9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86; 6 studies, 2639 participants).Results were inconclusive for short-term serious adverse events and cardiovascular events (low quality evidence). There were 17/918 serious adverse events in people taking celecoxib compared to 42/1236 among people who received placebo (Peto OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.28; 5 studies, 2154 participants). Cardiovascular events were reported in both celecoxib and placebo groups in one study (149 participants).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Celecoxib may improve clinical symptoms, alleviate pain and contribute to little or no difference in physical function compared with placebo. Celecoxib was associated with fewer numbers of participant withdrawals. Results for incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and short-term serious adverse events were uncertain; however, there were few reported events for either.Celecoxib may slightly improve clinical symptoms compared with tNSAIDs. Results for reduced pain and improved physical function were uncertain. Particpants taking celecoxib had lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and there were fewer withdrawals from trials. Results for cardiovascular events and short-term serious adverse events were also uncertain.Uncertainty about the rate of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and tNSAIDs could be due to risk of bias; another factor is that these were small, short-term trials. It has been reported previously that both celecoxib and tNSAIDs increase cardiovascular event rates. Our confidence in results about harms is therefore low. Larger head-to-head clinical trials comparing celecoxib to other tNSAIDs is needed to better inform clinical practice.",2017,,"Fidahic M, Jelicic Kadic A, Radic M, Puljak L.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012095.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing any oral NSAID with placebo or another active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC), serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events; secondary outcomes were adverse events, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and outcomes relating to sleep, fatigue, and quality of life. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.<h4>Main results</h4>Our searches identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 292 participants in suitably characterised fibromyalgia. The mean age of participants was between 39 and 50 years, and 89% to 100% were women. The initial pain intensity was around 7/10 on a 0 to 10 pain scale, indicating severe pain. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. The duration of treatment in the double-blind phase varied between three and eight weeks.Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest. Analyses consistently showed no significant difference between NSAID and placebo: substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction) (risk difference (RD) -0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.04) 2 studies, 146 participants; moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction) (RD -0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) 3 studies, 192 participants; withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.09) 4 studies, 230 participants; participants experiencing any adverse event (RD 0.08 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.19) 4 studies, 230 participants; all-cause withdrawals (RD 0.03 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.14) 3 studies, 192 participants. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. Although most studies had some measures of health-related quality of life, fibromyalgia impact, or other outcomes, none reported the outcomes beyond saying that there was no or little difference between the treatment groups.We downgraded evidence on all outcomes to very low quality, meaning that this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect could be substantially different is very high. This is based on the small numbers of studies, participants, and events, as well as other deficiencies of reporting study quality allowing possible risks of bias.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is only a modest amount of very low-quality evidence about the use of NSAIDs in fibromyalgia, and that comes from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias. That bias would normally be to increase the apparent benefits of NSAIDs, but no such benefits were seen. Consequently, NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for treating fibromyalgia.",2017,,"Derry S, Wiffen PJ, Häuser W, Mücke M, Tölle TR, Bell RF, Moore RA.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012332.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,28770976,28770976.0,10.1002/14651858.cd012537.pub2,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as important.We designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions.As the leading cause of morbidity in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (that is pain lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications (nociceptive, neuropathic, or idiopathic) from genetic conditions, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, as well as for other unknown reasons.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain, reduce fever, and for their anti-inflammation properties. They are commonly used within paediatric pain management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently licensed for use in Western countries, however they are not approved for infants under three months old. The main adverse effects include renal impairment and gastrointestinal issues. Common side effects in children include diarrhoea, headache, nausea, constipation, rash, dizziness, and abdominal pain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of NSAIDs used to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and 17 years, in any setting.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 6 September 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, as well as online clinical trial registries.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding, of any dose and any route, treating chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents, comparing any NSAID with placebo or an active comparator.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables.<h4>Main results</h4>We included seven studies with a total of 1074 participants (aged 2 to 18 years) with chronic juvenile polyarthritis or chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. All seven studies compared an NSAID with an active comparator. None of the studies were placebo controlled. No two studies investigated the same type of NSAID compared with another. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis.Risk of bias varied. For randomisation and allocation concealment, one study was low risk and six studies were unclear risk. For blinding of participants and personnel, three studies were low risk and four studies were unclear to high risk. For blinding of outcome assessors, all studies were unclear risk. For attrition, four studies were low risk and three studies were unclear risk. For selective reporting, four studies were low risk, two studies were unclear risk, and one study was high risk. For size, three studies were unclear risk and four studies were high risk. For other potential sources of bias, seven studies were low risk. Primary outcomesThree studies reported participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between meloxicam and naproxen, celecoxib and naproxen, or rofecoxib and naproxen (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence).One study reported participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between low-dose meloxicam (0.125 mg/kg) and high-dose meloxicam (0.25 mg/kg) when compared to naproxen 10 mg/kg (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence).One study reported Patient Global Impression of Change, showing 'very much improved' in 85% of ibuprofen and 90% of aspirin participants (low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomesAll seven studies reported adverse events. Participants reporting an adverse event (one or more per person) by drug were: aspirin 85/202; fenoprofen 28/49; ibuprofen 40/45; indomethacin 9/30; ketoprofen 9/30; meloxicam 18/47; naproxen 44/202; and rofecoxib 47/209 (very low-quality evidence).All seven studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. Participants withdrawn due to an adverse event by drug were: aspirin 16/120; celecoxib 10/159; fenoprofen 0/49; ibuprofen 0/45; indomethacin 0/30; ketoprofen 0/30; meloxicam 10/147; naproxen 17/285; and rofecoxib 3/209 (very low-quality evidence).All seven studies reported serious adverse events. Participants experiencing a serious adverse event by drug were: aspirin 13/120; celecoxib 5/159; fenoprofen 0/79; ketoprofen 0/30; ibuprofen 4/45; indomethacin 0/30; meloxicam 11/147; naproxen 10/285; and rofecoxib 0/209 (very low-quality evidence).There were few or no data for our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning as defined by validated scales; and quality of life as defined by validated scales (very low-quality evidence).We rated the overall quality of the evidence (GRADE rating) for our primary and secondary outcomes as very low because there were limited data from studies and no opportunity for a meta-analysis.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>We identified only a small number of studies, with insufficient data for analysis.As we could undertake no meta-analysis, we are unable to comment about efficacy or harm from the use of NSAIDs to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents. Similarly, we cannot comment on our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning; and quality of life.We know from adult randomised controlled trials that some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, can be effective in certain chronic pain conditions.",2017,,"Eccleston C, Cooper TE, Fisher E, Anderson B, Wilkinson NM.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012537.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,38180091,38180091.0,10.1002/14651858.cd015432.pub2,Ibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in children.,"<h4>Background</h4>Children often require pain management following surgery to avoid suffering. Effective pain management has consequences for healing time and quality of life. Ibuprofen, a frequently used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered to children, is used to treat pain and inflammation in the postoperative period.<h4>Objectives</h4>1) To assess the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen (any dose) for acute postoperative pain management in children compared with placebo or other active comparators. 2) To compare ibuprofen administered at different doses, routes (e.g. oral, intravenous, etc.), or strategies (e.g. as needed versus as scheduled).<h4>Search methods</h4>We used standard Cochrane search methods. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trials registries in August 2023.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 17 years and younger, treated for acute postoperative or postprocedural pain, that compared ibuprofen to placebo or any active comparator. We included RCTs that compared different administration routes, doses of ibuprofen and schedules.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We adhered to standard Cochrane methods for data collection and analysis. Our primary outcomes were pain relief reported by the child, pain intensity reported by the child, adverse events, and serious adverse events. We present results using risk ratios (RR) and standardised mean differences (SMD), with the associated confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 43 RCTs that enroled 4265 children (3935 children included in this review). We rated the overall risk of bias at the study level as high or unclear for 37 studies that had one or several unclear or high risk of bias judgements across the domains. We judged six studies as having a low risk of bias across all domains. Ibuprofen versus placebo (35 RCTs) No studies reported pain relief reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen probably reduces child-reported pain intensity less than two hours postintervention compared to placebo (SMD -1.12, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.86; 3 studies, 259 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may reduce child-reported pain intensity, two hours to less than 24 hours postintervention (SMD -1.01, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.78; 5 studies, 345 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may result in little to no difference in adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.23; 5 studies, 384 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus paracetamol (21 RCTs) No studies reported pain relief reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen likely reduces child-reported pain intensity less than two hours postintervention compared to paracetamol (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.02; 2 studies, 100 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may slightly reduce child-reported pain intensity two hours to 24 hours postintervention (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.02; 6 studies, 422 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may result in little to no difference in adverse events (0 events in each group; 1 study, 44 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus morphine (1 RCT) No studies reported pain relief or pain intensity reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen likely results in a reduction in adverse events compared to morphine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.83; risk difference (RD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 4; 1 study, 154 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus ketorolac (1 RCT) No studies reported pain relief or pain intensity reported by the child, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen may result in a reduction in adverse events compared to ketorolac (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.96; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.04; NNTB 4; 1 study, 59 children; low-certainty evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Despite identifying 43 RCTs, we remain uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen compared to placebo or active comparators for some critical outcomes and in the comparisons between different doses, schedules and routes for ibuprofen administration. This is largely due to poor reporting on important outcomes such as serious adverse events, and poor study conduct or reporting that reduced our confidence in the results, along with small underpowered studies. Compared to placebo, ibuprofen likely results in pain reduction less than two hours postintervention, however, the efficacy might be lower at two hours to 24 hours. Compared to paracetamol, ibuprofen likely results in pain reduction up to 24 hours postintervention. We could not explore if there was a different effect in different kinds of surgeries or procedures. Ibuprofen likely results in a reduction in adverse events compared to morphine, and in little to no difference in bleeding when compared to paracetamol. We remain mostly uncertain about the safety of ibuprofen compared to other drugs.",2024,,"Pessano S, Gloeck NR, Tancredi L, Ringsten M, Hohlfeld A, Ebrahim S, Albertella M, Kredo T, Bruschettini M.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015432.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Here, a human cartilage microtissue (HCM) nanoenabled with ibuprofen-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (ibu-PLGA NPs) is 4D-bioprinted to locally mitigate inflammation and impair nerve sprouting. Under an in vitro inflamed environment, the nanoenabled HCM exhibits chondroprotective potential by decreasing the interleukin (IL)1β and IL6 release, while sustaining extracellular matrix (ECM) production. In vivo, assessments utilizing the air pouch mouse model affirm the nanoenabled HCM non-immunogenicity. Nanoenabled HCM-derived secretomes do not elicit a systemic immune response and decrease locally the recruitment of mature dendritic cells and the secretion of multiple inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteinases when compared to inflamed HCM condition. Notably, the nanoenabled HCM secretome has no impact on the innervation profile of the skin above the pouch cavity, suggesting a potential to impede nerve growth.

MED,25363470,25363470.0,10.1002/bip.22580,Correlation between membrane translocation and analgesic efficacy in kyotorphin derivatives.,"Amidated kyotorphin (L-Tyr-L-Arg-NH2; KTP-NH2) causes analgesia when systemically administered. The lipophilic ibuprofen-conjugated derivative of KTP-NH2 has improved analgesic efficacy. However, fast degradation by peptidases impacts negatively in the pharmacodynamics of these drugs. In this work, selected derivatives of KTP and KTP-NH2 were synthesized to combine lipophilicity and resistance to enzymatic degradation. Eight novel structural modifications were tested for the potential to transverse lipid membranes and to evaluate their efficacy in vivo. The rationale behind the design of the pool of the eight selected molecules consisted in the addition of individual group at the N-terminus, namely the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetyl, butanoyl, and propanoyl or in the substitution of the tyrosine residue by an indole moiety and in the replacement of the peptidic bond by a urea-like bond in some cases. All the drugs used in the study are intrinsically fluorescent, which enables the use of spectrofluorimetry to sample the drugs in the permeation assays. The results show that the BOC and indolyl derivatives of KTP-NH2 have maximal ability to permeate membranes with concomitant maximal analgesic power. Overall, the results demonstrate that membrane permeation is correlated with analgesic efficacy. However, this is not the only factor accounting for analgesia. KTP-NH2 for instance has low passive permeation but is known to have central action.

The methanol extract was partitioned, and the hexane fraction with the best bioactivity was subjected to column chromatography before characterization via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-visible (UV-VIS) and NMR analysis. The in vivo anti-inflammatory properties of the methanol extract and hexane fraction were investigated using the formalin-induced oedema model in rats. The compound's antioxidant, red blood cell (RBC) membrane stabilization and phospholipase-A2 (PL-A2) inhibitory effects were evaluated in vitro.

The in vivo anti-inflammatory assay showed significant oedema reduction of the hexane fraction at 200 mg/kg. The compound also displayed Fe<sup>3+</sup> reduction and scavenged free radical molecules while showing PL-A2 inhibition and the ability to limit RBC haemolysis. The compound also presented stronger affinities for PL-A2 (-7.6 kcal/mol) and NF-κB (-6.0 kcal/mol) than indomethacin and ibuprofen drugs, with a favourable pharmacokinetic model.

This case report details a 40-year-old female presenting with a 12-month history of right arm pain and restricted movement, ultimately diagnosed with Takayasu arteritis. The patient exhibited hallmark features, including a diminished right radial pulse, blood pressure asymmetry (150/92 mmHg left, 125/80 mmHg right), and mild right arm weakness (4/5 strength). Physical examination of the shoulders revealed limited active range of motion in the right shoulder, with abduction restricted to 90° and external rotation to 30°, likely due to ischemic changes, while the left shoulder showed full range of motion. Laboratory findings confirmed active inflammation, with C-reactive protein (CRP) at 18.4 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 45 mm/h, alongside mild anemia (11.5 g/dL) and reactive thrombocytosis (360-410 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). CT angiography revealed thrombotic occlusion of the left vertebral artery (60%-70%), significant narrowing with thin flow in the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, moderate occlusion with reconstituted flow in the left mid and distal brachial and radial arteries, and narrowing in the right ulnar and interosseous arteries. Additionally, a 4.0 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm was identified, a potentially life-threatening complication. Treatment was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days), transitioning to oral prednisone (50 mg/day), combined with ibuprofen for pain (400 mg as needed, up to 1200 mg daily), amlodipine and nifedipine for hypertension, and esomeprazole for gastric protection. A multidisciplinary approach was emphasized, integrating rheumatology and vascular surgery, with plans for steroid-sparing agents (methotrexate or azathioprine) and serial aneurysm surveillance. This case underscores the complexity of Takayasu arteritis, highlighting the need for comprehensive vascular assessments, tailored immunosuppression, and vigilant monitoring to prevent complications and optimize outcomes.",2025,,"Abrar S, Khalil I, Ahmed ST, Spriha FR, Hossain MI, Sayed MA.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ccr3.71362,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Three different assemblies using indomethacin, ibuprofen and ketoprofen as NSAIDs were easily obtained in water by an acid-base reaction. These assemblies formed new amphiphilic entities because of electrostatic and hydrophobic effects in water and led to the spontaneous formation of vesicles. These catanionic vesicles were then tested as potential NSAID delivery systems for dermatological application. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vivo, and this study clearly showed an improved therapeutic effect for NSAIDs that were formulated as catanionic vesicles. These vesicles ensured a slower diffusion of the NSAID through the skin. This release probably increased the time of retention of the NSAID in the targeted strata of the skin. Thus, the present study suggests that this catanionic bioactive formulation could be a promising dermal delivery system for NSAIDs in the course of skin inflammation treatment.",2007,,"Consola S, Blanzat M, Perez E, Garrigues JC, Bordat P, Rico-Lattes I.",https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.200601449,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The relative cardiovascular safety of NSAID use is of considerable concern, particularly among patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease. Until recently, the evidence base was limited to older trials with small sample sizes. The large-scale Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs Ibuprofen or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial and a recent Bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data in nearly a half-million patients were undertaken to address some of the existing gaps in knowledge relative to the cardiovascular safety of NSAID use. We reviewed the results, strengths, and limitations of PRECISION. We believe that the results of the meta-analysis will further assist clinicians in decision-making for management of patients with osteoarthritis. The totality of evidence would support avoidance of NSAID use, if possible, in patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. If used, the shortest-duration and lowest effective NSAID doses should be chosen, given the evidence that risk is duration- and dose-dependent.

Cisplatin analogues were conjugated with COX inhibitors (indomethacin, ibuprofen) to study the synergistic effects that were previously observed in combination treatments. The conjugates ensure concerted transport of both drugs into cells, and subsequent intracellular cleavage enables a dual-action mode. Whereas the platinum(II) complexes showed cytotoxicities similar to those of cisplatin, the platinum(IV) conjugates revealed highly increased cytotoxic activities and were able to completely overcome cisplatin-related resistance. Although some of the complexes are potent COX inhibitors, the conjugates appear to execute their cytotoxic action via COX-independent mechanisms. Instead, the increased lipophilicity and kinetic inertness of the conjugates seem to facilitate cellular accumulation of the platinum drugs and thus improve the efficacy of the antitumor agents. These conjugates are important tools for the elucidation of the direct influence of COX inhibitors on platinum-based anticancer drugs in tumor cells.",2015,,"Neumann W, Crews BC, Sárosi MB, Daniel CM, Ghebreselasie K, Scholz MS, Marnett LJ, Hey-Hawkins E.",https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.201402353,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We also ensured that the quality of treatment was not compromised throughout the study.<h4>Material and methods</h4>Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two groups: the ibuprofen-placebo (IP) group and the placebo-ibuprofen (PI) group. On postoperative Day (POD) 1, the IP group initiated ibuprofen administration, while the PI group started taking placebo. On POD 2, the IP group switched to using placebo, whereas the PI group switched to ibuprofen. From PODs 3-5, both groups were prescribed ibuprofen gargle.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential protective effects of SM extract on spermatogenesis in male Wistar rats following ibuprofen administration. A total of 42 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: control group; SM group (200 mg/kg); ibuprofen-treated groups at doses of 15 mg/kg (IbL) and 30 mg/kg (IbH); and two co-treatment groups receiving SM (200 mg/kg) along with either 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of ibuprofen. Serum levels of testosterone, FSH, and LH were measured using ELISA assay kits. Oxidative stress markers including TAC, MDA, GPx, and CAT were also assessed using specific commercial diagnostic kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Histopathological evaluation of testicular tissue was performed using the Johnsen scoring system, and sperm parameters were analyzed from the epididymal tail. Significant histopathological changes were observed only in the IbH group (30 mg/kg), showing a decrease in seminiferous tubule thickness and count compared to control (<i>p < 0.05</i>). No significant differences were found in Johnsen scores or necrosis grades among groups. Serum testosterone levels significantly increased in the SM-treated group (<i>p <</i> 0.05), while FSH and LH levels remained unchanged. The highest CAT activity was observed in the SM group, whereas the lowest was in the IbH and IbL groups (<i>p <</i> 0.05). The highest MDA level was detected in the IbL group, and the highest GPx level was seen in the SM + IbH group. Sperm parameters improved significantly in the SM-treated groups but were adversely affected by high-dose ibuprofen (<i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings indicate that ibuprofen, especially at a high dose, may impair spermatogenesis and sperm quality, potentially through induction of oxidative stress. In contrast, SM demonstrated protective effects by improving testosterone levels, enhancing antioxidant defense (TAC), and partially restoring sperm parameters. These results suggest that SM could serve as a potential natural supplement to mitigate the adverse effects of ibuprofen on male reproductive health.",2025,,"Salehi F, Zarei L, Mokhayeri Y, Rajabzadeh O.",https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.70705,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In our study, we examine associations between factors related to inflammation and specific rectal cancer mutations. A population-based study of 750 rectal cancer cases with interview and tumor DNA were compared to 1,205 population-based controls. Study participants were from Utah and the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. Tumor DNA was analyzed for TP53 and KRAS2 mutations and CpG Island methylator phenotype. We assessed how these tumor markers were associated with use of anti-inflammatory drugs, polymorphisms in the IL6 genes (rs1800795 and rs1800796) and dietary antioxidants. Ibuprofen-type drugs, IL6 polymorphisms (rs1800796) and dietary alpha-tocopherol and lycopene significantly altered likelihood of having a TP53 mutation.

The sol-gel transition temperatures of the Pluronic mixtures could be controlled by adjusting F127/F68 ratio and polymer concentration. The mildly crosslinked alginate with still flow property provided the residence stability of Pluronic mixture gels in the body. Ibuprofen was loaded in Pluronic mixtures to reduce inflammatory response in the body and, thus, to prevent tissue adhesion. The gelation temperatures of the Pluronic mixtures were not affected by the alginate but lowered by the addition of ibuprofen. The in vitro drug release behavior and in vivo peritoneal tissue adhesion of the Pluronic mixtures with the sol-gel transition just below body temperatures were investigated. The drug release behavior from the ibuprofen (1 wt%)-loaded Pluronic mixture gels at 37 degrees C was examined using a membrane-less dissolution model. The drug in the mixture gels was released continuously up to about 45-65% of the total loading amount during the first 7 days. For in vivo evaluation of tissue anti-adhesion potential, the Pluronic mixtures with/without drug were coated on the peritoneal wall defects of rats and their tissue adhesion extents and tissue reactions (inflammatory response, granulation tissue formation, and toxicity in organs) were compared. It was observed that ibuprofen has a positive effect for the peritoneal tissue anti-adhesion. The Pluronic F127/F68/alginate/ibuprofen mixture gel (25 wt% of F127/F68 [7/3], 1 wt% ibuprofen) was highly effective for the prevention of peritoneal tissue adhesion and showed a relatively low inflammatory response and non-toxicity, and thus can be a good candidate material as a coatable or injectable tissue adhesion barrier gel.",2005,,"Oh SH, Kim JK, Song KS, Noh SM, Ghil SH, Yuk SH, Lee JH.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.30239,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Nanofibrous PLA scaffolds containing 10, 20, or 30 wt % ibuprofen were created and ibuprofen release profiles quantified. In vitro cytotoxicity to human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) of the three scaffolds with varying ibuprofen concentrations were evaluated and compared to pure PLA nanofibrous scaffolds. Thereafter, scaffolds loaded with ibuprofen at the concentration that promoted human skin cell viability and proliferation (20 wt %) were evaluated in vivo in nude mice using a full thickness skin incision model to determine the ability of these scaffolds to promote skin regeneration and/or assist with scarless healing. Both acellular and HEK and HDF cell-seeded 20 wt % ibuprofen loaded nanofibrous bandages reduced wound contraction compared with wounds treated with Tegaderm™ and sterile gauze. Newly regenerated skin on wounds treated with cell-seeded 20 wt % ibuprofen bandages exhibited significantly greater blood vessel formation relative to acellular ibuprofen bandages. We have found that degradable anti-inflammatory scaffolds containing 20 wt % ibuprofen promote human skin cell viability and proliferation in vitro, reduce wound contraction in vivo, and when seeded with skin cells, also enhance new blood vessel formation.

Clinical observations suggest that these effects can be prevented, to some extent, by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We have examined the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in IL-1-induced gene expression by human skin fibroblasts in culture. Incubation of confluent fibroblast cultures with varying concentrations (0.01-1.0 microgram/ml) of PGE2 led to a dose-dependent elevation of collagenase mRNA steady-state levels, the promoter activity, and the secretion of the protein, whereas relatively little effect was observed on stromelysin and TIMP gene expression. Exogenous PGE2 had no additive or synergistic effect with IL-1 on collagenase gene expression. Furthermore, commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, acetyl salicylic acid and ibuprofen), at doses which block prostaglandin synthesis in cultured fibroblasts, failed to counteract IL-1-induced collagenase and stromelysin gene expression, nor did they affect TIMP expression. Although the effects of PGE2 did not potentiate those of IL-1 on collagenase gene expression in vitro, one could speculate that massive production of PGE2 by connective tissue cells in vivo in response to inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, could lead to sustained expression of collagenase in connective tissue cells after clearance of the growth factors.",1994,,"Mauviel A, Halcin C, Vasiloudes P, Parks WC, Kurkinen M, Uitto J.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.240540413,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Dermatopharmacokinetic parameters, characterizing drug amount in and diffusivity through the SC, were derived. The solubility behavior of ibuprofen in PG-water mixtures was carefully evaluated, as were a number of other physical properties. Ibuprofen delivery depended on the level of PG in the vehicle, despite all formulations containing the drug at equal thermodynamic activity. PG appeared to alter the solubility of ibuprofen in the SC (presumably via its own uptake into the membrane), the effect becoming more important as the volume fraction of cosolvent in the formulation increased.

This study examines the structural basis for HSA binding of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM via competition with drugs having known albumin binding sites. Warfarin, furosemide, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone, benzylpenicillin, and cephmandole were added to HSA solutions at drug:HSA mole ratios from 0 to 8:1, followed by quantification of radiopharmaceutical binding to HSA by ultrafiltration. Warfarin, a site IIA drug, progressively displaced both [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM from HSA. At 8:1 warfarin:HSA mole ratios, free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM levels increased 300-500%. This was in contrast to solutions containing ibuprofen, a site IIIA drug; no increase in free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM or [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM was observed except at high ibuprofen:HSA ratios, where secondary ibuprofen binding to the IIA site may cause modest radiopharmaceutical displacement. By contrast, and consistent with earlier findings suggesting Cu-ETS exhibits only nonspecific associations, [(64)Cu]Cu-ETS binding to HSA was unaffected by the addition of drugs that bind in either site.

The applicability of an electronic tongue in the development of a taste masked generic ibuprofen suspension, starting from a commercial taste masked product, was evaluated in this study. The initial screening study on 3 proprietary and 11 generic products showed that sensors of the taste sensing system TS-5000Z could clearly detect differences between the products. The variation of sensor responses were mainly caused by sodium salts, sweeteners, and preservatives, whereas pH and viscosity did not affect sensor response. In addition, the presence of the particles (20-100 µm) did not damage the sensor membranes. Based on this screening, and the known qualitative composition of the proprietary formulations, the approximate quantitative composition of a proprietary formulation could be deduced and a taste masked generic formulation could be developed using the electronic tongue data. Differences in sensor responses between the proprietary and optimized generic formulation were smaller than 11 mV for each sensor. Based on these results a rational approach of implementing an electronic tongue to simplify the development of a taste masked generic formulation could be introduced.",2011,,"Woertz K, Tissen C, Kleinebudde P, Breitkreutz J.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.22629,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen (150 mg) formulations with several concentrations of two different vasodilators and/or a penetration enhancer (PE) complex were topically applied to rabbits. Plasma levels of ibuprofen were determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method and evaluated at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h. The PE complex enhanced the plasma ibuprofen level approximately sevenfold versus control, and tolazoline (0.005%) added to the PE complex increased the plasma levels of ibuprofen approximately another twofold compared with the PE. Higher concentrations of tolazoline paradoxically did not exhibit vasodilator enhancement to ibuprofen delivery. Papaverine was tested in the same manner. In this set of experiments, PE increased the plasma ibuprofen 3.7-fold versus control, and addition of papaverine (0.0005%) increased plasma ibuprofen an additional 3.3-fold compared with the PE formulation.

This study investigated the effect of common topical excipients on the simultaneous lateral diffusion and stratum corneum (SC) penetration of a model compound, ibuprofen (IBU) in humans. IBU solutions with and without propylene glycol (PG), polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG 200), and/or octisalate (OS) were dosed onto the forearm of participants. At various times, 10 ""tape-strippings"" were obtained with perforated concentric tapes and analyzed for IBU concentration and SC protein mass. Complimentary in vitro permeation studies assessed the effect of excipients on the percutaneous absorption of IBU across human skin. Following in vivo application, IBU displayed a greater tendency for lateral diffusion when applied with OS, whereas IBU resisted lateral diffusion when dosed with PG and PEG 200. After 24 h, 25.3 ± 8.0% and 55.5 ± 18.6% of IBU was recovered from the SC in vivo with and without excipients, respectively. There was a twofold-to threefold enhancement in IBU flux in vitro when applied with excipients. The lower IBU recovery from the SC when applied with excipients may be attributed to the permeation enhancement effects of these excipients.

As a result, platelet donors are temporarily deferred from donating if they have recently taken NSAIDs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Despite these measures, a proportion of platelet donations show exposure to these drugs; however, little is known about the effect of NSAIDs and their metabolites on platelet quality in vivo and during storage. In this review, the effect of NSAIDs on platelet function is summarized, with a focus on the widely consumed over-the-counter (OTC) medications aspirin, ibuprofen, and the non-NSAID paracetamol. Aspirin and ibuprofen have well-defined antiplatelet effects. In comparison, studies regarding the effect of paracetamol on platelets report variable findings. The timing and order of NSAID intake is important, as concurrent NSAID use can inhibit or potentiate platelet activation depending on the drug taken. NSAID deferral periods and maximum platelet shelf-life is set by each country and are revised regularly. Reduced donor deferral periods and longer platelet storage times may affect the quality of platelet products, and it is therefore important to identify the possible impact of NSAID intake on platelet quality before and after storage.",2020,,"Driver B, Marks DC, van der Wal DE.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/rth2.12283,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) is a clinically relevant platform to direct stem cell migration. Through mechanotransduction, pFUS establishes local gradients of cytokines, chemokines, trophic factors (CCTF) and cell adhesion molecules (CAM) in treated skeletal muscle that subsequently infused mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can capitalize to migrate into the parenchyma. Characterizing molecular responses to mechanical pFUS effects revealed tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) drives cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) signaling to locally increase CCTF/CAM that are necessary for MSC homing. pFUS failed to increase chemoattractants and induce MSC homing to treated muscle in mice pretreated with ibuprofen (nonspecific COX inhibitor) or etanercept (TNFα inhibitor). pFUS-induced MSC homing was also suppressed in COX2-knockout mice, demonstrating ibuprofen blocked the mechanically induced CCTF/CAM by acting on COX2. Anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, are administered to muscular dystrophy (MD) patients, and ibuprofen also suppressed pFUS-induced homing to muscle in a mouse model of MD.

The analogs represented substitution of the lipophilic isobutyl side chains of ibufenac and ibuprofen with hydrophilic hydroxyethoxy side chains. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by administering drugs topically to inhibit inflammation induced by using either clove oil or arachidonic acid. The rank order of activity was ibufenac approximately equal to ibuprofen > R3 approximately equal to R4. The new compounds, R3 and R4, were highly water soluble (> 60-fold) and partitioned less (< 1/1500-fold) into the lipid phase when compared to ibufenac and ibuprofen. R3 and R4 each had apparent corneal permeability coefficients of 6 x 10(-6) cm/sec, whereas ibufenac and ibuprofen yielded values of about 22 x 10(-6) cm/sec. In an ocular pharmacokinetic study in the rabbit eye, constant concentrations of each compound were maintained on the cornea in a cylinder or well fixed to the cornea, resulting in a constant input rate. This method circumvented parallel loss routes at the absorption site including nasolacrimal drainage. From area calculations the dispositions of the compounds within the eye were described by mean residence times, steady state volumes of distributions, and clearance rates. R3 and R4 were more slowly absorbed, retained within eye tissues longer, and were cleared more slowly from the eye than ibufenac and ibuprofen. The aqueous humor concentration-time profiles were also computer-fitted to equations representing classical pharmacokinetic models. For ibufenac and ibuprofen, the entire cornea was assumed to be the net barrier for entry into the anterior chamber. Whereas, for R3 and R4, the corneal epithelium and endothelium were presumed to be the diffusional barriers into and out of the stroma, the latter treated as a compartment. Aqueous humor concentrations of each drug fit the models reasonable well and agreed with conclusions made from the use of area calculations.

Nitrite production by peritoneal macrophages from mice receiving OK-432 treatment was significantly inhibited by phospholipase A2 inhibitors [dexamethasone and 4-bromophenacyl bromide (4-BPB)], lipoxygenase inhibitors [nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and ketoconazole] and a glutathione S-transferase (leukotrienes LTA4-LTC4) inhibitor (ethacrynic acid). However, caffeic acid and esculetin, inhibitors of 5- and 12-lipoxygenase respectively, were not inhibitory. On the other hand, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, slightly inhibited whereas another inhibitor, ibuprofen, did not. Inhibition of the nitrite production by dexamethasone, 4-BPB, NDGA and ethacrynic acid was also demonstrated when the macrophages were restimulated ex vivo with OK-432 or with lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory activity of dexamethasone, NDGA and ethacrynic acid was significantly reduced by ex vivo restimulation with OK-432, whereas that of 4-BPB was hardly affected. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of dexamethasone, NDGA and ethacrynic acid was much higher when the macrophages were continuously exposed to the agents than when they were pulsed. Meanwhile, inhibition by 4-BPB was almost the same with either treatment. In addition, the inhibitory activity of these agents was not blocked with L-arginine, a substrate of NO synthases, or with arachidonate metabolites (LTB4, LTC4 and LTE4). Ethacrynic acid and 4-BPB, but not dexamethasone and NDGA, also inhibited nitrite production by the cytosolic fractions from OK-432-restimulated peritoneal macrophages, and the inhibitory activity of 4-BPB was superior to that of ethacrynic acid. These agents, however, did not inhibit nitrite production from sodium nitroprusside, a spontaneous NO-releasing compound. These results indicate that dexamethasone, 4-BPB, NDGA and ethacrynic acid inhibited the production of NO by macrophages through at least two different mechanisms: one was inhibited by dexamethasone, NDGA and ethacrynic acid and the other by 4-BPB. Furthermore, 4-BPB and ethacrynic acid directly inhibited the activity of the NO synthase in macrophages, suggesting that the agents work by binding to the active site(s) of the enzyme.",1993,,"Ryoyama K, Nomura T, Nakamura S.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01526795,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We undertook these experiments because the major toxic side-effects following L-MTP-PE infusion, fever and chills, could be prevented when ibuprofen was given orally immediately before L-MTP-PE infusion. It was therefore important to determine whether ibuprofen interfered with the macrophage-activation properties of L-MTP-PE. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from normal donors, then incubated with L-MTP-PE in the presence or absence of ibuprofen. The cytotoxic properties of the monocytes were assessed by a radioisotope-release assay against A375 cells. Ibuprofen at dose levels of 40 micrograms/ml suppressed the generation of the cytotoxic phenotype but did not interfere with the killing process once the cells were activated. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) production, as well as the mRNA expression of these cytokines, was suppressed by 40 micrograms/ml ibuprofen. Since IL-1 and TNF play a crucial role in the cytotoxic function of monocytes, these findings may explain the mechanism by which ibuprofen inhibited the generation of the cytotoxic phenotype by L-MTP-PE. By contrast, ibuprofen dose levels up to 10 micrograms/ml had no effect on the generation of monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity by L-MTP-PE and no effect on the production, secretion, or mRNA expression of TNF and IL-1. Therefore, we concluded that if ibuprofen is to be used to control the side-effects of L-MTP-PE, blood levels of up to 10 micrograms/ml are desirable. In two of three patients, we determined that an oral dose of 200 mg given immediately before L-MTP-PE infusion could achieve these desired blood levels.",1993,,"Fujimaki W, Griffin JR, Kleinerman ES.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01789130,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,8179173,8179173.0,10.1007/s001010050053,[The effect of thoracic epidural anesthesia on the pathophysiology of the eventration syndrome].,"Abdominal mesenteric traction (MT) results in decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased cardiac output (CO). This response is induced by a considerable release of prostacyclin (PGI2). Precipitous falls in systemic arterial pressure related to central and/or autonomic nervous reflex arcs also have been described during operations on the upper abdominal viscera. Those hypotensive responses to visceral traction appear to be transmitted along afferent fibres contained within the splanchnic nerves. We investigated the influence of supplementary thoracic epidural anaesthesia on mesenteric traction response during major abdominal surgery. METHODS. With the approval of the Human Investigation Review Board we studied 40 patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery (infrarenal aortic, gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgery) according to a prospective, randomized double-blinded protocol. Patients were randomized to two different anaesthetic regimens. Patients in group 1 received general anaesthesia (GA n = 20) with 0.1-0.15 mg/kg midazolam and 10 micrograms/kg fentanyl prior to skin incision. Maintenance included 65% nitric oxide in oxygen and 0.1 mg increments of fentanyl as required. Group 2 patients (EA n = 20) underwent a combined technique of dose-reduced general anaesthesia and supplementary continuous, thoracic epidural anaesthesia (bupivacaine 0.25%, sensory blockade T4 to L1-3). In both anaesthesia groups ibuprofen (400 mg i.v.) or a placebo equivalent was administered 15 min before the induction of anaesthesia. MT was applied in a uniform fashion. Baseline values preceded the incision of the peritoneum. Further assessments followed 5, 15 and 30 min after MT. The plasma concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (stable metabolite of PGI2), TXB2 (stable metabolite of thromboxane), PGF2 alpha, KH2-PGF2 alpha (stable metabolite of PGF2 alpha) were determined by radioimmunoassay. At all assessments we recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and measured arterial blood gases. Statistical analyses were performed using three-factor ANOVA for repeated measurements after log(x) transformation. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant when the Bonferroni-Holm adjustment was applied. RESULTS. Patients with supplementary epidural anaesthesia demonstrated lower systolic (P = 0.0001) and diastolic (P = 0.006) blood pressure than those in the GA group. Nevertheless, in untreated patients in the EA and GA group there was a significant decrease of about 20-30% in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0001) after mesenteric traction. Irrespective of the anaesthetic procedure, paO2 (P = 0.0001) decreased after mesenteric traction in the placebo group. The control patients in the GA group exhibited a more pronounced increase in heart rate after MT. After traction on the mesentery a significant 20- to 30-fold increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha plasma concentrations occurred in the placebo group: GA group 1950/58 (5 min), 1574/59 (15 min) 858/66 (30 min) ng/l, P < 0.0001; EA group: 2002/106 (5 min), 2955/107 (15 min) 1807/70 (30 min) ng/l, P < 0.0001, for placebo vs ibuprofen. There was no statistically significant difference between the two anaesthetic procedures used. In ibuprofen-pretreated patients haemodynamics and paO2 values were stable, while 6-keto-PGF1 alpha plasma concentrations remained within the normal range. CONCLUSION. Our data clearly indicate that the mesenteric traction response consists in relevant haemodynamic alterations and a significant decrease of paO2. Stable haemodynamics and paO2 following cyclooxygenase inhibition signify an action mediated by prostacyclin. Deafferentation of the splanchnic nerves by supplementary thoracic epidural anaesthesia did not influence either prostacyclin release or the decrease in blood pressure and paO2 after traction on the mesentery root...",1994,,"Brinkmann A, Seeling W, Wolf CF, Kneitinger E, Junger S, Rockemann M, Oettinger W, Georgieff M.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s001010050053,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In addition to cholinergic crisis, neurodegeneration and brain damage are hallmarks of the severe form of this toxidrome. Recently, we generated a chemical model of severe acute OP intoxication in zebrafish that is characterized by altered head morphology and brain degeneration. The pathophysiological pathways resulting in brain toxicity in this model are similar to those described in humans. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive power of this zebrafish model by testing the effect of a panel of drugs that provide protection in mammalian models. The selected drugs included ""standard therapy"" drugs (atropine and pralidoxime), reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (huperzine A, galantamine, physostigmine and pyridostigmine), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (MK-801 and memantine), dual-function NMDA receptor and acetylcholine receptor antagonists (caramiphen and benactyzine) and anti-inflammatory drugs (dexamethasone and ibuprofen). The effects of these drugs on zebrafish survival and the prevalence of abnormal head morphology in the larvae exposed to 4 µM chlorpyrifos oxon [1 × median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>)] were determined. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of pralidoxime, memantine, caramiphen and dexamethasone at the gross morphological level were confirmed by histopathological and transcriptional analyses.

This hypothesis was taken up by the lay press and led to concerns among doctors and patients whether the use of these drugs was still safe and justified against the background of the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 with an increasing number of cases and deaths. In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease. In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective. In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.

Three studies were conducted to evaluate the early phase (acute, day 1) and late phase (days 2-12) effects of SJP-005 on discontinuation-induced morphine withdrawal.<h4>Methods</h4>Sprague-Dawley rats received subcutaneous morphine twice daily for 18 days and ceased on day 19. Twice daily, oral dosages of placebo or SJP-005 (1 mg/kg ketotifen and 15 mg/kg ibuprofen) were administered starting 4 days before (study 1), 2 days before (study 2), or immediately after (study 3) morphine cessation. Functional observations were made up to 12 h after treatment cessation on day 19 (early phase), and immediately after treatment on days 20-30 (late phase). Treatment effects (mean overall score, and individual symptoms) were compared with placebo using ANOVA, and Tukey's tests in case of multiple comparisons.<h4>Results</h4>Across the studies, the number of withdrawal signs on day 19 (early phase) and days 20-30 (late phase) was lower with SJP-005 compared with placebo. The effects of SJP-005 when treatment was initiated 2 days before morphine cessation by discontinuation were most pronounced and statistically significant in the late phase (F<sub>(1,18)</sub> = 14.10, p = 0.001). In particular, a significant reduction was observed in hypersensitivity to touch (F<sub>(1,18)</sub> = 13.65, p = 0.002). A 50% reduction in withdrawal symptoms was observed 9.0 days after placebo versus 4.5 days after SJP-005. After 9.0 days, all withdrawal symptoms were absent in the SJP-005 group, while symptoms in the placebo group were still evident on day 18.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Compared to placebo, SJP-005 significantly reduced the incidence and duration of discontinuation-induced morphine withdrawal symptoms when treatment was initiated 2 days before morphine cessation.",2021,,"Verster JC, Scholey A, Dahl TA, Iversen JM.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-021-05771-5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is hypothesized that the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nonspecific COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors) such as ibuprofen principally derive from COX-2 inhibition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetics, biochemical selectivity and tolerability of rofecoxib (Vioxx), characterized in vitro as a COX-2 inhibitor.<h4>Methods</h4>Four panels of healthy men (n = 8 per panel) were administered rofecoxib (n = 6) (25, 100, 250, 375 mg) or placebo (n = 2) once daily on day 1 and days 3-14. Blood samples for assays of rofecoxib plasma concentration and COX isoform activity were obtained pre-dose and at specified time points post-dose.<h4>Results</h4>Rofecoxib pharmacokinetics were found to be complex and nonlinear. Elimination half-life ranged from 9.9 h to 17.5 h after multiple dosing with an accumulation ratio close to 2 for all doses.

Smoking is a documented risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and the risk is increased in smokers who also consume alcohol. Arachidonic acid (AA)-metabolizing enzymes have been implicated in aggressive clinical behavior of pancreatic cancer while mutations in the Ki- ras gene have been associated with prolonged survival and responsiveness to therapy. Using a hamster model of exocrine pancreatic cancer induced by transplacental exposure to ethanol and the tobacco-carcinogen NNK, we have analyzed these tumors for mutations in the ras and p53 genes and tested the modulating effects of the COX inhibitor, ibuprofen, and the FLAP inhibitor, MK886, on the development of pancreatic cancer in this animal model.<h4>Methods</h4>Hamsters were given 10% ethanol in the drinking water from the fifth to the last day of their pregnancy and a single dose of NNK on the last day.

Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Points• Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.• Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.• Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.",2020,,"Misra DP, Agarwal V, Gasparyan AY, Zimba O.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05073-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This inconsistency may result from differences in etiology for breast tumors of different subtypes. We examined the association between NSAID use and breast cancer characterized by molecular subtypes in a population-based case-control study in Western New York. Cases (n = 1,170) were women with incident, primary, histologically confirmed breast cancer. Controls (n = 2,115) were randomly selected from NY Department of Motor Vehicles records (<65 years) or Medicare rolls (≥ 65 years). Participants answered questions regarding their use of aspirin and ibuprofen in the year prior to interview and their use of aspirin throughout their adult life. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Recent and lifetime aspirin use was associated with reduced risk, with no differences by subtype. Recent use of ibuprofen was significantly associated with increased risk of ER+/PR+(OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.09-1.62), HER2- (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05-1.53), and p53- breast cancers (OR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.57), as well as luminal A or B breast cancers.

The underlying mechanisms of neuronal loss are not fully understood, but the activation of CNS resident phagocytic microglia seems to be a significant element contributing to neurodegeneration. At the onset of inflammation, high levels of microglial phagocytosis may serve as an essential prerequisite for creating a favorable environment for neuronal regeneration. However, the excessive and long-lasting activation of microglia and the augmented engulfment of neurons have been suggested to eventually govern widespread neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated in a functional assay of acute inflammation how the small GTPase RhoA and its main target the Rho kinase (ROCK) influence microglial phagocytosis of neuronal debris. Using BV-2 microglia and human NT2 model neurons, we demonstrate that the pain reliever Ibuprofen decreases RhoA activation and microglial phagocytosis of neuronal cell fragments. Inhibition of the downstream effector ROCK with the small-molecule agents Y-27632 and Fasudil reduces the engulfment of neuronal debris and attenuates the production of the inflammatory mediator nitric oxide during stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Our results support a therapeutic potential for RhoA/ROCK-inhibiting agents as an effective treatment of excessive inflammation and the resulting progression of microglia-mediated neurodegeneration in the CNS.",2017,,"Scheiblich H, Bicker G.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-016-0379-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In addition to the classical mode of action of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indomethacin, and ibuprofen have Rho-inhibiting effects. In order to evaluate the role of the Rho GTPase pathway on Aβ-induced neuronal death and on neuronal morphological modifications in the actin cytoskeleton, we explored the role of NSAIDS in human-differentiated neuroblastoma cells exposed to Aβ. We found that Aβ induced neurite retraction and promoted the formation of different actin-dependent structures such as stress fibers, filopodia, lamellipodia, and ruffles. In the presence of Aβ, both NSAIDs prevented neurite collapse and formation of stress fibers without affecting the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. Similar results were obtained when the downstream effector, Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632, was applied in the presence of Aβ.

In this study, 70 compounds representing several classes of pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, insect repellant, antibacterial, antidepressants, chemotherapy drugs, and X-ray contrast media compounds, were found in dreissenid mussel (zebra/quagga; Dreissena spp.) tissue samples. Overall concentration and detection frequencies varied significantly among sampling locations, site land-use categories, and sites sampled proximate and downstream of point source discharge. Verapamil, triclocarban, etoposide, citalopram, diphenhydramine, sertraline, amitriptyline, and DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) comprised the most ubiquitous PPCPs (> 50%) detected in dreissenid mussels. Among those compounds quantified in mussel tissue, sertraline, metformin, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, theophylline, zidovudine, prednisone, clonidine, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, iopamidol, and melphalan were detected at concentrations up to 475 ng/g (wet weight). Antihypertensives, antibiotics, and antidepressants accounted for the majority of the compounds quantified in mussel tissue. The results showed that PPCPs quantified in dreissenid mussels are occurring as complex mixtures, with 4 to 28 compounds detected at one or more sampling locations. The magnitude and composition of PPCPs detected were highest for sites not influenced by either WWTP or CSO discharge (i.e., non-WWTPs), strongly supporting non-point sources as important drivers and pathways for PPCPs detected in this study.

However, long-term therapy with and improper use of NSAIDs may lead to gastrointestinal damage. Therefore, improving the therapeutic index of the existing drugs has become a priority over the past decades. Considerable attention in the field has been concentrated on metal complexes of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of complexation with zinc on the anti-inflammatory and ulcerogenic effects of ibuprofen and naproxen after single and triple intragastric administration to rats. The anti-inflammatory effect was assessed in carrageenan-induced inflammatory edema in the hind paw of male albino Wistar rats. The mucosal lesions were inspected and evaluated for gross pathology. Single administration of both the investigated complexes, namely zinc-ibuprofen and zinc-naproxen (20 mg/kg equivalent to ibuprofen and naproxen, respectively) and their parent drugs and physical mixtures with zinc hydroaspartate (ZHA doses: 16.05 and 14.37 mg/kg), caused a significant reduction of the edema after the same time from the carrageenan injection in comparison to the control groups. However, no statistically significant differences between the investigated drugs were observed after their single administration. The mean ulceration score for the mixture of ibuprofen and ZHA was statistically lower than the mean score achieved in rats after treatment with ibuprofen alone. On the other hand, triple intragastric administration of the ZHA-ibuprofen and ZHA-naproxen combination showed substantial enhancement of the anti-inflammatory activity against control groups, as well as against the parent NSAIDs. The most potent anti-inflammatory activity was demonstrated after 2 h from the carrageenan injection in animals receiving ZHA together with naproxen. The edema growth was reduced in these animals by 80.9% as compared to the control group. This result was significantly higher than the results achieved in animals receiving zinc-naproxen (50.2%) or naproxen alone (47.9%). Both NSAID complexes with zinc and mixtures with ZHA alleviated ulcerations caused by parent NSAIDs; however, the mixtures of both ibuprofen and naproxen with ZHA after triple administration were the least damaging. In view of the above results, zinc supplementation during NSAID therapy may have a beneficial effect on ulcer prevention and healing by reducing the effective dose of the parent drug and increasing its potency.",2017,,"Jarosz M, Szkaradek N, Marona H, Nowak G, Młyniec K, Librowski T.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-017-0361-0,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However ibuprofen comes with serious unavoidable adverse effects on various organs when used for long duration or overdosed. Trichopus zeylanicus is a medicinal plant endemic to India owning various beneficial properties and is been used in treating various ailments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the ameliorative effect of aqueous leaves' extract of Trichopus zeylanicus against ibuprofen-induced hepatic toxicity and enteropathy in rats. Overall in this study 30 male albino rats were used, which were divided into five groups (six in each group). Group-I was normal control, Group-II was ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day) inebriated group, Group-III was silymarin (25 mg/kg/day) pretreated + ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day), Group-IV was ALETZ (1000 mg/kg/day) pretreated + ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day), and Group-V was ALETZ alone (1000 mg/kg/day) group. The duration of the administration was for five days, followed by scarifying rats on the sixth day. Later the rats were assessed for liver and intestine enzyme markers, antioxidant parameters along with histopathological changes. In addition the pro-inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels were measured using ELISA. Lastly the expression pattern of apoptotic signaling markers such as caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bcl-2 was evaluated using western blot. The results obtained from this study showed changes in levels of aforesaid parameter which presented the toxic effect of ibuprofen on liver and small intestine. Pre-treatment of ALETZ in ibuprofen-inebriated group was able to normalize the adverse effect caused due to ibuprofen.

In the absence of any robust mechanistic and clinical evidence, this speculation led to confusion about the safety of ibuprofen, contributing to the so-called 'infodemic' surrounding COVID-19. A wealth of evidence has been generated in subsequent years, and this narrative review aims to consider the body of in vitro and in vivo research, observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the use of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, in COVID-19. Overall, the direction of evidence supports that NSAIDs do not increase susceptibility to infection, nor worsen disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) has a high fatality rate, and there is no effective or standard treatment. The disease progresses rapidly and these tumors can invade the trachea and esophagus, leading to breathing and swallowing difficulties. Hence, new treatment methods are greatly needed. Ibuprofen is a common drug that can exert antitumor effects in some cancers. In this study, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that ibuprofen can induce ATC pyroptosis. Hence, we treated C643 and OCUT-2C ATC cells with ibuprofen and found that several dying cells presented the characteristic morphological features of pyroptosis, such as bubble-like swelling and membrane rupture, accompanied by activation of ASC and NLRP3 and cleavage of GSDMD. Along with the increased release of LDH, ibuprofen treatment promoted apoptosis and inhibited viability, invasion, and migration. However, overexpression of GSDMD significantly inhibited ibuprofen-induced pyroptosis.

Bilayer patches comprised a solvent cast film onto which electrospun aligned fibres have been deposited. Both layers were loaded with ibuprofen. In vitro release (37°C, in phosphate buffered saline) of the drug from the loaded scaffolds under sink condition was found to occur in the first 24 h. The released ibuprofen was shown to retain its bioactivity, as indicated by the reduction of RhoA activation when the neuronal-like cell line ND7/23 was challenged with lysophosphatidic acid. Ibuprofen-loaded P(TMC-CL) bilayer scaffolds were successfully implanted in vivo in a dorsal hemisection rat SCI model mediating the reduction of RhoA activation after 5 days of implantation in comparison to plain P(TMC-CL) scaffolds.

In the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective properties of several COX inhibitors against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in neuroblastoma Neuro 2A (N-2A) cells in vitro and the protection against degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons after the administration of 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in C57/BL6 male mice. The data obtained demonstrate a lack of protective effects observed by COX 1-2 inhibitors ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid against MPP+ toxicity in N-2A, where piroxicam was protective in a dose dependent manner (MPP+ control: 15 +/- 2% MPP+ piroxicam: 5 mM 89 +/- 4%). The data also indicate a drop in mitochondrial oxygen (O(2)) consumption and ATP during MPP+ toxicity with no restoration of mitochondrial function concurrent to a heightened concentration of somatic ATP during piroxicam rescue. These findings indicate that the neuroprotective effects of COX inhibitors against MPP+ are not consistent, but that piroxicam may work through an unique mechanism to propel anaerobic energy metabolism.

Relative to the applied dose, the in vivo recovery of all compounds from the combined 10 strips at 3 mins ranged between 83.0 and 92.9 % and decreased to between 64.5 and 66.9 % at 3 h. IBU recovery further decreased to 47.7 ± 5.6 % at 6 h, correlating with greater in vitro penetration relative to CAF and HC.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Drug concentration decreased with increased lateral distance from the application site. The lower recovery of IBU in the upper tape strip regions compared to CAF and HC may be a consequence of greater penetration into the SC with time.",2012,,"Gee CM, Nicolazzo JA, Watkinson AC, Finnin BC.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-012-0731-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

After oral administration, pomaglumetad methionil is rapidly taken up by enterocytes via PEPT1 and once absorbed, converted to LY404039 via membrane dehydropeptidase 1 (DPEP1). LY404039 is renally excreted by both glomerular filtration and active secretion and in vitro studies showed that the active secretion of LY404039 was mediated by the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1). Both clinical and in vitro data were used to build a PBPK model to predict OAT1-mediated DDIs.<h4>Results</h4>In vitro inhibitory potencies (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the known OAT inhibitors, probenecid and ibuprofen, were determined to be 4.00 and 2.63 µM, respectively. Subsequently, clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study showed probenecid reduced the renal clearance of LY404039 by 30 to 40%. The PBPK bottom-up model, predicted a renal clearance that was approximately 20% lower than the observed one. The middle-out model, using an OAT1 relative activity factor (RAF) of 3, accurately reproduced the renal clearance of LY404039 and pharmacokinetic (PK) changes of LY404039 in the presence of probenecid.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OAT1- mediated DDIs can be predicted using in vitro measured IC<sub>50</sub> and PBPK modeling.

Among them, monocyclic paracetamol and ibuprofen, widely used to treat mild and moderate pain are the most popular. Since long-term adverse effects of these xenobiotics and their biological and pharmacokinetic activity especially at environmentally relevant concentrations are better understood, degradation of such contaminants has become a major concern. Moreover, to date, conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not fully adapted to remove that kind of micropollutants. Bioremediation processes, which utilize bacterial strains with increased degradation abilities, seem to be a promising alternative to the chemical methods used so far. Nevertheless, despite the wide prevalence of paracetamol and ibuprofen in the environment, toxicity and mechanism of their microbial degradation as well as genetic background of these processes remain not fully characterized.

The treatment specific wastewater lines with the corresponding lettuce plants, differentiated into roots and shoots, were monitored for priority wastewater micropollutants, i.e., acesulfame (sweetener), caffeine (stimulant), carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole with acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (human pharmaceuticals), 1H-benzotriazole, and 4/5-methylbenzotriazole (industrial chemicals). As clearly demonstrated, conventional tertiary treatment could not efficiently clean up wastewater. Removal efficiencies ranged from 3% for carbamazepine to 100% for ibuprofen. The resulting pollution of the hydroponic water lines led to the accumulation of acesulfame, carbamazepine, and diclofenac in lettuce root systems at 32.0, 69.5, and 135 μg kg<sup>-1</sup> and in the uptake of acesulfame and carbamazepine into lettuce shoots at 23.4 and 120 μg kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight, respectively.

Alternative test models such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo have received increasing attention, with minor modifications of the fish embryo toxicity test (FET; OECD TG 236) as a tool to assess behavioral endpoints related to neurotoxicity during early developmental stages. The spontaneous tail movement assay, also known as coiling assay, assesses the development of random movement into complex behavioral patterns and has proven sensitive to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors at sublethal concentrations. The present study explored the sensitivity of the assay to neurotoxicants with other modes of action (MoAs). Here, five compounds with diverse MoAs were tested at sublethal concentrations: acrylamide, carbaryl, hexachlorophene, ibuprofen, and rotenone. While carbaryl, hexachlorophene, and rotenone consistently induced severe behavioral alterations by ~ 30 h post fertilization (hpf), acrylamide and ibuprofen expressed time- and/or concentration-dependent effects. At 37-38 hpf, additional observations revealed behavioral changes during dark phases with a strict concentration-dependency.

This review presents a description of the literature published focused on post-COVID headache. Additionally, we discuss potential mechanisms and considerations for treatment of post-COVID headache.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Headache is one of the most common symptoms of COVID. Common characteristics are revealed when reviewing the phenotypes of headaches that have been described in patients with COVID-19, with most headache phenotypes resembling migraine and new persistent daily headache. Post-COVID headaches are often described as moderate to severe, persistent, and treatment refractory. This review highlights the diversity of presentation of headaches that present as a complication of COVID-19. Treatment of post-COVID headache is challenging, especially in the setting of a pandemic where resources are limited.<h4>Clinical case</h4>A 42-year-old woman with a history of episodic migraine without aura presents over video visit with a new headache type. Her typical headaches are predominantly left sided, throbbing in nature, and associated with photophobia and phonophobia. They are fully relieved by oral sumatriptan 2 h after treatment. She describes this new headache as a constant, pulsating, holocephalic pain with no other migrainous features that have been ongoing for 6 weeks. She notes that the headache has been persistent since that time. She has tried over-the-counter acetaminophen and ibuprofen and her typical migraine abortive therapy without relief. She is debilitated and wonders if there is anything that will take the pain away. She shares that she tested positive for COVID-19 about 2 days prior to headache onset and has associated rhinorrhea, anosmia, and ageusia.",2022,,"Chhabra N, Grill MF, Singh RBH.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11916-022-01086-y,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study, the dexibuprofen-loaded emulsion gel and ibuprofen-loaded emulsion gel were prepared with isopropanol, Tween 80, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate and carbopol. Their mechanical properties such as hardness and adhesiveness were assessed. Moreover, their skin permeation, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive efficacy were evaluated using Franz diffusion cell with the hairless mouse skin, the carrageenan-induced paw oedema test and paw pressure test in rat's hind paws compared with the commercial hydrogel, respectively. The dexibuprofen emulsion gel and ibuprofen emulsion gel provided significantly higher hardness and adhesiveness than the commercial hydrogel. The dexibuprofen emulsion gel enhanced skin permeability by about twofold and 3.5-fold without lag time compared to the ibuprofen emulsion gel and the commercial hydrogel, respectively, suggesting its faster skin permeation. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory efficacy and alleviation in carrageenan-induced inflammation was in the order of dexibuprofen emulsion gel > commercial hydrogel > ibuprofen emulsion gel. The dexibuprofen emulsion gel furnished significantly higher nociceptive thresholds than the ibuprofen emulsion gel and the commercial hydrogel, leading to the most improved anti-nociceptive efficacy.

Recognition of proteins that act as agents of repressing such repair has become the norm to tackle these abominable conditions. One such protein is LINGO1 that act as a repressor for axonal growth. Being one of the critical causative agents of several neurodegenerative pathways. Consequently, its inhibition may tend to help the outcomes of regenerative technologies aiming to outweigh the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. For this objective, LINGO1 was targeted with pharmacophore analogs of Fasudil and Ibuprofen, as they are known to have a deterring effect against the concerned protein. 1-Tosyl-2-(chloromethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole was found showing the least binding score of - 6.8, with verified ADMET admissibility. The pharmacological activity of the said ligand was estimated with QSAR tool showing favourable electro-steric model. All this was finally collaborated with a molecular dynamics simulation study which exhibited a stable structure compatibility of the ligand with LINGO-1.

However, for the manufacturing of formulations, continuous processes are always preferred over batch processes since they are more efficient and offer better quality of the end product. Hence, we developed topical SLN of ibuprofen (IBU) using hot melt extrusion (HME), prepared a gel formulation, and performed its in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Effect of different variables of HME equipment and materials used in SLN was optimized using design of experiment (DoE) approach.

Here, we propose a novel treatment that combines the advantages of nanomedicine and local drug delivery to target these infiltrating GBM cells. We developed an injectable lipid nanocapsule (LNC)-based formulation loaded with lauroyl-doxorubicin prodrug (DOXC<sub>12</sub>). Firstly, we demonstrated the efficacy of intratumoral administration of DOXC<sub>12</sub> in GL261 GBM-bearing mice, which extended mouse survival. Then, we formulated an injectable hydrogel by mixing the appropriate amount of prodrug with the lipophilic components of LNC. We optimized the hydrogel by incorporating cytidine-C<sub>16</sub> (CytC<sub>16</sub>) to achieve a mechanical stiffness adapted for an application in the brain post-surgery (DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup>). DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup> exhibited high DOXC<sub>12</sub> encapsulation efficiency (95%) and a size of approximately 60 nm with sustained drug release for over 1 month in vitro. DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup> exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity compared to free DOXC<sub>12</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> of 349 and 86 nM, respectively) on GL261 GBM cells and prevented the growth of GL261 spheroids cultured on organotypic brain slices. In vivo, post-surgical treatment with DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup> significantly improved the survival of GL261-bearing mice. The combination of this local treatment with the systemic administration of anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen further delayed the onset of recurrences.

However, drug delivery using hydrogel-forming MN arrays tends to be relatively slow compared to rapid drug delivery using conventional needles and syringes. Therefore, in this work, for the first time, different physical and chemical delivery enhancement methods were employed in combination with PVA-based hydrogel-forming MN arrays. Using a model drug, ibuprofen (IBU) sodium, the designed systems were assessed in terms of the extent of transdermal delivery. Iontophoresis (ITP) and heat-assisted drug delivery technology were investigated as physical permeation enhancement techniques. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that the ITP (0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>)-mediated combination strategy significantly enhanced the transdermal permeation of IBU sodium over the first 6 h (~ 5.11 mg) when compared to MN alone (~ 1.63 mg) (p < 0.05). In contrast, heat-assisted technology showed almost no promoting effect on transdermal delivery. Furthermore, IBU sodium-containing rapidly dissolving lyophilised and effervescent reservoirs, classified as chemical modification methods, were prepared. Both strategies achieved rapid and effective ex vivo IBU sodium permeation, equating to ~ 78% (30.66 mg) and ~ 71% (28.43 mg) from lyophilised and effervescent reservoirs, respectively. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that the IBU sodium plasma concentration within lyophilised and effervescent groups reached a maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) at 4 h (~ 282.15 µg/mL) and 6 h (~ 140.81 µg/mL), respectively.

Patients wore a containment hood to diminish aerosolization. Outcome data from participating patients treated at multiple hospitals in Argentina between April 4 and October 31, 2020, are summarized. Results were compared with a retrospective contemporaneous control (CC) group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SOC alone during the same time frame from a subset of participating hospitals from Córdoba and Buenos Aires.<h4>Results</h4>The evolution of 383 patients treated with SOC + NaIHS [56 on mechanical ventilation (MV) at baseline] and 195 CC (21 on MV at baseline) are summarized. At baseline, NaIHS-treated patients had basal oxygen saturation of 90.7 ± 0.2% (74.3% were on supplemental oxygen at baseline) and a basal respiratory rate of 22.7 ± 0.3 breath/min. In the CC group, basal oxygen saturation was 92.6 ± 0.4% (52.1% were on oxygen supplementation at baseline) and respiratory rate was 19.3 ± 0.3 breath/min. Despite greater pulmonary compromise at baseline in the NaIHS-treated group, the length of treatment (LOT) was 9.1 ± 0.2 gs with an average length of stay (ALOS) of 11.5 ± 0.3 days, in comparison with an ALOS of 13.3 ± 0.9 days in the CC group. In patients on MV who received NaIHS, the ALOS was lower than in the CC group. In both NaIHS-treated groups, a rapid reversal of deterioration in oxygenation and NEWS2 scores was observed acutely after initiation of NaIHS therapy. No serious adverse events were considered related to ibuprofen therapy.

Nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is attributed to physical and psychosocial factors, including lifestyle factors, obesity, and depression. Mechanical low back pain occurs related to repeated trauma to or overuse of the spine, intervertebral disks, and surrounding tissues. This causes disc herniation, vertebral compression fractures, lumbar spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, and lumbosacral muscle strain.<h4>Recent findings</h4>A systematic review of relevant literature was conducted. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two clinical trials registry databases up to 24 June 2015 were included in this review. Search terms included: low back pain, over the counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), CLBP, ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, disk herniation, lumbar spondylosis, vertebral compression fractures, spondylolisthesis, and lumbosacral muscle strain. Over-the-counter analgesics are the most frequently used first-line medication for LBP, and current guidelines indicate that over-the-counter medications should be the first prescribed treatment for non-specific LBP. Current literature suggests that NSAIDs and acetaminophen as well as antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and opioids are effective treatments for CLBP. Recent randomized controlled trials also evaluate the benefit of buprenorphine, tramadol, and strong opioids such as oxycodone. This systematic review discusses current evidence pertaining to non-prescription treatment options for chronic low back pain.",2021,,"Peck J, Urits I, Peoples S, Foster L, Malla A, Berger AA, Cornett EM, Kassem H, Herman J, Kaye AD, Viswanath O.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-020-00209-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Outcomes included postoperative Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) at different times (2, 6, 12, and 24 h), opioid consumption within 24 h post-operation, time to first rescue analgesia, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and incidence of postoperative headache or dizziness.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-nine articles involving 5987 patients were included. The network meta-analysis revealed that multimodal analgesia, nerve blocks, pregabalin, and gabapentin significantly reduced postoperative pain scores at all postoperative time points and postoperative opioid consumption compared to placebo. Tramadol, pregabalin, and gabapentin significantly extended the time to first rescue analgesia. Ibuprofen was the best intervention for reducing PONV incidence. Tramadol significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative headache or dizziness. Subgroup analysis of different doses of pregabalin and gabapentin showed that compared to placebo, pregabalin (300 mg, 150 mg) and gabapentin (600 mg, 300 mg, and 20 mg/kg) were all more effective without significant differences in efficacy between these doses. Higher doses increased the incidence of PONV and postoperative headache and dizziness, with gabapentin 300 mg having a lower adverse drug reaction (ADR) incidence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Preemptive analgesia significantly reduced postoperative pain intensity, opioid consumption, extended the time to first rescue analgesia, and decreased the incidence of PONV and postoperative headache and dizziness. Multimodal analgesia, nerve blocks, pregabalin, and gabapentin all showed good efficacy. Gabapentin 300 mg given preoperatively significantly reduced postoperative pain and ADR incidence, recommended for preemptive analgesia in LC.<h4>Trial registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD42024522185.",2024,,"Cao L, Yang T, Hou Y, Yong S, Zhou N.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-024-00647-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although previous studies have evaluated the COX inhibitory activity and selectivity of NSAIDs, none has compared COX inhibitory concentrations with the plasma concentrations of clinical doses or investigated the efficacy and adverse effects of different dosage forms. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the COX inhibitory activities and inhibition rates of clinical doses of the various NSAID formulations, especially diclofenac sodium.<h4>Methods</h4>Human blood and the drug (diclofenac sodium, celecoxib, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, or etodolac) were mixed and incubated, and the supernatant was collected and quantified the COX inhibitory activity of each drug by ELISA. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the inhibition rates at maximum plasma drug concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of clinical doses of marketed formulations. For diclofenac sodium, we also calculated the concentrations at which COX inhibition rates were 50% and 80% (IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>80</sub>).<h4>Results</h4>COX-2 inhibition rate at C<sub>max</sub> of clinical doses exceeded 50% except celecoxib 100 mg. For diclofenac sodium, the C<sub>max</sub> at the clinical doses of the oral and suppository formulations showed almost complete inhibition of COX-2 and an inhibition rate exceeding IC<sub>80</sub> for COX-1. The C<sub>max</sub> at repeated doses of the transdermal formulation showed an inhibition rate above IC<sub>80</sub> for COX-2 but below IC<sub>80</sub> for COX-1.<h4>Discussion</h4>This result explains why gastrointestinal disorders frequently occur with oral and suppository formulations of diclofenac sodium despite its relatively high COX-2 selectivity. Although the plasma drug concentration of the transdermal formulation is lower than oral and suppository formulations, it has an inhibition rate above IC<sub>50</sub> for COX-2, which is required for analgesic efficacy, and has a lower COX-1 inhibition rate than these formulations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings explain why the transdermal formulation exerts an analgesic effect despite having a lower C<sub>max</sub> than other diclofenac sodium formulations.",2025,,"Shirakawa K, Takeno M, Kuma H, Terahara T, Yamaguchi S.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-024-00687-2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Researching for novel techniques to reduce these side effects and increase patient adherence to medical treatment is of interest. The current study aims to develop an innovative nano-sized gastro-retentive drug delivery for better management of poorly water-soluble drugs.<h4>Method</h4>A non-disintegrating ibuprofen-asymmetric membrane floating nanoparticle (Ibuprofen-AMFNP) was prepared by phase inversion technique to increase the gastric residence of the drug. Powder characterization, solubility, in vitro buoyancy, effect on in vivo inflammatory markers, and polymer diffusibility studies were conducted on the prepared formulation. All UV-spectrophotometric analysis was accomplished through a fiber optic system.<h4>Results</h4>The prepared Ibuprofen-AMFNPs were in the nano range of 114.45 nm ±1.31 nm. The formulation was buoyant for 12 h in the dissolution media indicating increased gastric residence, had better solubility and powder characteristics compared to the pure drug. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an outer non-porous and inner porous asymmetric membrane. Ibuprofen-AMFNP followed Higuchi drug release kinetics (p=0.9925) and had a Fickian diffusion release mechanism (n=0.05). Polymer diffusibility study showed that the 24 h stored formulation had faster drug release with no lag time (-923.08 nm/h) compared to a fresh formulation (2526.32 nm/h). The prepared nano-formulation showed a higher percentage of anti-inflammatory (85.144%) effect compared to the pure drug (78.336%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen-AMFNP is envisioned to help reduce drug-related GI side effects, improve drug delivery, and thereby increase patient adherence to medical treatment.",2021,,"Samuel BA, Mohammed BI, Philip AK.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8602594,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Furthermore, <i>Hammada elegans</i> Botsch. (Chenopodiaceae) a xerophytic plant popularly known as (Ajram) is widely spread perennial shrub in Laghouat region and it is traditionally used to treat inflammation and diabete. Then, the objective of this work is to study for the first time the in vivo anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and acute toxicity effects of acetonic, methanolic and aqueous <i>Hammada elegans</i> Botsch extracts.<h4>Methods</h4>The acute toxicity test was performed according to the OECD method using single increasing doses (50-1500 mg/kg bw). The anti-inflammatory effect is investigated in Wistar rats by using the rat paw edema assay. The antidiabetic activity was evaluated in vivo using three tests: short-term test (in non-diabetic rats), starch-induced hyperglycemia test (in non-diabetic rats) and long-term alloxan test (experimental diabetes).<h4>Results</h4>The acute toxicity results show no deaths in rats and no clinical signs of toxicity. The anti-inflammatory effects showed that all extracts significantly inhibit rat paw edema (EC<sub>50</sub> less than 345.51 ± 0.29 mg/kg bw). Therefore, the acetonic extract (EC<sub>50</sub> = 157.45 ± 0.33 mg/kg bw) had the more active anti-inflammatory activity than that of the standard inhibitor ""Ibuprofen"". In addition, the evaluation of the antidiabetic activities by three tests shows that: in, in the short-term test, there was no important decrease in normal rats glucose rate, while in the starch-induced hyperglycemia test, the aqueous extract decreased significantly hyperglycemia (57.21 ± 1.24 mg AEAC / kg bw) compared to all tested extracts. While in the long-term test, the acetone extract significantly decreased hyperglycemia (9.18 ± 0.72 mg GEAC / kg bw) compared to all the tested extracts.<h4>Conclusions</h4><i>Hammada elegans</i> Botsch extracts seem to have therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of the inflammation and diabetes.",2021,,"Asseli B, Djeridane A, Mahfoudi R, Yousfi M.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-021-00762-x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Increased usage of these chemicals poses a serious risk to ecology and human health due to their leakage into surface waters. In the present study, carbide derived carbon (CDC) was used for the first time as a new adsorbent to remove ibuprofen from synthetic water and wastewater effluent.<h4>Methods</h4>The morphology, chemical composition, surface area and surface charge of the CDC particles were investigated using the transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, BET analysis and zeta potential measurements. The effects of CDC dosage, temperature, initial pH and agitation speed on the adsorption process were examined by using batch adsorption experiments. Moreover, the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and isotherms were investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Adsorption and kinetic equilibrium data demonstrate that the adsorption of ibuprofen onto the CDC obeys the Langmuir isotherm model and the kinetics follow the pseudo-2nd order mechanism. The thermodynamic results reveal that ibuprofen adsorption is endothermic and spontaneous. The ibuprofen removal by CDC was mainly controlled by the electrostatic forces at high pH of the feed solution and by the dispersive interactions in acidic media. The ibuprofen removal is promoted at high temperature, high agitation speed and low pH. The highest adsorption capacity of ibuprofen onto the CDC was 367 mg/g at pH 3. Furthermore, the CDC efficiently removed ibuprofen from spiked treated sewage effluent.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The obtained data indicate that the CDC provides a fast and efficient adsorptive removal of ibuprofen both from a model aqueous solution and treated sewage effluent.",2020,,"Almanassra IW, Kochkodan V, Ponnusamy G, Mckay G, Ali Atieh M, Al-Ansari T.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40201-020-00554-0,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Its efficacy and safety profile have led to its increasing use in paediatric care, even without medical prescription. However, an increase of suspected adverse reactions to ibuprofen has been noted in concomitance with the raised, often medically unsupervised, consumption of the drug. The purpose of this work was a critical review of the paediatric literature over the last 15 years on side effects and adverse events associated with ibuprofen, in order to highlight circumstances associated with higher risks and to promote safe and appropriate use of this drug. The literature from 2000 to date demonstrates that gastrointestinal events are rare, but (when they occur) include both upper and lower digestive tract lesions. Dehydration plays an important role in triggering renal damage, so ibuprofen should not be given to patients with diarrhoea and vomiting, with or without fever. Likewise, ibuprofen should never be administered to patients who are sensitive to it or to other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated in neonates and in children with wheezing and persistent asthma and/or during varicella. Most of the analysed studies reported adverse events when ibuprofen was being used for fever symptoms or flu-like syndrome. Ibuprofen should not be used as an antipyretic, except in rare cases.

The primary endpoint was the time-weighted sum of pain relief and pain intensity difference scores from 0 to 8 h after dosing (SPRID[4]<sub>0-8</sub>). Time to meaningful pain relief (TMPR), duration of pain relief, and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 394 patients were randomized. All active treatments were superior to placebo for SPRID[4]<sub>0-8</sub> (all p < 0.001) but not significantly different from ibuprofen 400 mg. Median TMPR with FDCs and ibuprofen (44.5-54.1 and 56.2 min, respectively) was faster than with placebo (> 720 min; all p < 0.001 vs. placebo). Duration of pain relief was similar with the FDCs and ibuprofen 400 mg (9.7 -11.1 h) and longer than with placebo (1.6 h; all p < 0.001). AE incidence was comparable with all treatments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Each IBU/APAP FDC provided analgesic efficacy comparable to that with ibuprofen 400 mg and superior to that with placebo. Each FDC provided MPR in < 1 h, duration of pain relief > 9 h, and tolerability similar to that with ibuprofen and placebo.

The inhibitory activity of ibuprofen as a single agent was determined according to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, while the effect of ibuprofen combined with amphotericin B, itraconazole, or terbinafine was estimated by microdilution checkerboard methodology. The ultrastructural alterations of S. schenckii after exposure to the combination of ibuprofen and amphotericin B were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and flow cytometry analysis. As a single agent, ibuprofen inhibited Sporothrix growth with a MIC median of 256 μg/mL, while the MIC medians of ibuprofen in combination with antifungals were 16 μg/mL and 128 μg/mL. The MIC values of amphotericin B, itraconazole, and terbinafine were reduced when isolates were co-incubated with ibuprofen, mainly the polyene. The major alteration after treatment with the ibuprofen/amphotericin B combination was the increase in the presence of filamentous forms and high membrane damage with loss of plasma membrane integrity.

We comprehensively evaluated the pharmacological properties of the IBU derivatives, focusing on antioxidant activity (based on the ability to scavenge DPPH and ABTS), biocompatibility (using human dermal fibroblasts), and COX inhibitory potential. The antioxidant activity assays significantly enhanced DPPH scavenging activity for several IBU derivatives, particularly [L-SerOiPr][IBU], suggesting potential therapeutic benefits.

These responses are anteceded by mobilization of membrane-associated calcium, monitored as a decrease in fluorescence of cells preloaded with chlortetracycline (CTC). We studied the effects, both in vitro and in vivo, of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (aspirin, indomethacin, ibuprofen and piroxicam) on these neutrophil responses to three stimuli: a chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP); a tumor promotor, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA); and a lectin, concanavalin A (Con A). The effects of these drugs were compared with those of two polyenoic inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism: eicosatrienoic acid (ETI) and eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA). The pattern of inhibition of neutrophil functions varied both with inhibitor and the nature of the stimulus. Thus, aspirin, piroxicam, ETYA and ETI inhibited neutrophil aggregation, degranulation, and O2- generation in response to FMLP, whereas ibuprofen inhibited only aggregation and degranulation and indomethacin only inhibited aggregation. None of the agents inhibited aggregation or degranulation induced by PMA or Con A: only piroxicam inhibited O2- generation in response to PMA or Con A. ETI and ibuprofen inhibited decrements of CTC fluorescence induced by FMLP, but whereas ETI inhibited the CTC response to PMA or Con A, ibuprofen was without effect. The agents had varying effects on binding of the stimulus [( 3H]FMLP, [3H]Con A), but these did not correlate with neutrophil responses to the ligands. Neutrophils from subjects taking therapeutic doses of ibuprofen, indomethacin, or piroxicam showed profiles of inhibited responses to FMLP similar to those observed with these agents in vitro. These data suggest that, although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may inhibit discrete neutrophil functions both in vitro and in vivo, their effects do not duplicate those of polyenoic inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism. Moreover, since the susceptibility of neutrophils differed not only with respect to each inhibitor, but also to the stimulus, it is unlikely that all neutrophil responses are necessarily linked by a common pathway that is blocked by inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism.",1984,,"Kaplan HB, Edelson HS, Korchak HM, Given WP, Abramson S, Weissmann G.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(84)90228-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The accumulation of intravenously-injected 125I-albumin was used to measure oedema. Two peptides were used to increase microvascular permeability: C5a des Arg, whose action is dependent on circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and bradykinin which acts directly on vascular endothelial cells. The peptides were injected intradermally together with either arachidonic acid or PGE2 to potentiate oedema formation. To study the cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity of ibuprofen, the effects of the mediators were potentiated by addition of arachidonic acid. To investigate whether the drug had effects independent of cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, PGE2 was used to potentiate responses. Both local and intravenous ibuprofen suppressed oedema induced by bradykinin + arachidonic acid and C5a des Arg + arachidonic acid, which is consistent with suppression of cyclo-oxygenase in the skin. Local ibuprofen had no effect on responses to bradykinin + PGE2 or C5a des Arg + PGE2. Intravenous ibuprofen had no significant effect on responses to bradykinin + PGE2 but, in contrast, had a marked inhibitory effect on responses to C5a des Arg + PGE2. It is concluded that, in addition to its known cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory activity, ibuprofen can inhibit inflammatory oedema at clinically-relevant doses by an action on circulating poly-morphonuclear leukocytes. These observations in vivo appear to be related to other observations on the effects of ibuprofen on polymorphonuclear leukocyte function in vitro and ex vivo.

Mediation of these effects by thromboxane A2 (TXA2) inhibition was discounted since under the same experimental conditions, adrenaline did not stimulate TXA2 synthesis and A23187-stimulated TXA2 synthesis was only marginally inhibited by concentrations of ibuprofen and indomethacin that inhibited 45Ca2+ uptake by 50%.

Mice were pretreated with indomethacin, aspirin or ibuprofen (all inhibitors of cyclooxygenase) and injected with phalloidin (2 mg/kg). The toxin induced 75% lethality and caused severe hemorrhagic necrosis of the liver associated with increased serum levels of AST and ALT. Indomethacin completely prevented the mortality and hepatic damage elicited by phalloidin as judged by morphologic analysis and serum AST and ALT release. The in vitro addition of indomethacin to suspensions of freshly-isolated hepatocytes decreased plasma membrane bleb formation induced by phalloidin.

HCT-8 cells showed typical epithelial cell morphology, with microvilli and intercellular junctional complexes, and formed domes, consistent with transepithelial fluid secretion. The cells express three intestinal brush-border enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and alpha-glucosidase), and adenylate cyclase can be stimulated with vasoactive intestinal peptide. The toxicity of eight non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; indomethacin, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, sulindac, aspirin, phenylbutazone and naproxen) were assessed using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays. The MTT assay was consistently a more sensitive measure of NSAID-induced toxicity, which suggests that perturbation of mitochondrial function may be an early event in NSAID-induced cellular damage. Comparing the rankings observed in acute studies in the rat in vivo with those observed with HCT-8 cells, there are some general agreements. Indomethacin, a potent ulcerogen in vivo, was consistently among the most toxic in vitro, while aspirin and phenylbutazone have comparatively low rankings in vitro and in vivo. In man, with chronic administration, indomethacin is again ranked as a potent ulcerogen, as is aspirin, in contrast to the in vitro data with HCT-8. Therefore, NSAID-induced toxicity in HCT-8 cells assessed by the MTT or neutral red assays, can only partially predict toxicity in vivo, which suggests that local gastro-intestinal environmental factors, such as luminal acidity, may play a role in vivo. The ability of HCT-8 cells to reconstitute intact epithelial layers, thereby allowing such environmental factors to be mimicked, allows further development of these cells as a model for the in vitro prediction of in vivo gastro-intestinal toxicity.",1991,,"Allen CN, Harpur ES, Gray TJ, Hirst BH.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0887-2333(91)90016-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, inflammatory responses caused by degradation of barrier materials remain a major challenge. This study aimed to fabricate electrospun composite fibrous membranes based on drug-loaded modified mesoporous silica (MMS) and poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA). Using a co-solvent-based electrospinning method ibuprofen (IBU)-loaded MMS was successfully and uniformly encapsulated in the PLLA fibers. The electrospun PLLA-MMS-IBU composite fibrous membranes showed significantly lower initial burst release (6% release in the first 12h) compared with that of electrospun PLLA-IBU fibrous membranes (46% release in the first 12h) in in vitro release tests. Moreover, the release from PLLA-MMS-IBU was also for significantly longer than that from PLLA-IBU (100 vs. 20days). In animal studies both PLLA-IBU and PLLA-MMS-IBU showed improved anti-adhesion properties and anti-inflammatory effects compared with PLLA fibrous membrane alone 4weeks after implantation. Further, animals implanted with PLLA-MMS-IBU for 8weeks showed the lowest inflammation and best recovery compared with those implanted with PLLA-IBU and PLLA, most likely as a result of its long-term IBU release profile. Therefore, this study provides a platform technique for fabricating fibrous membranes with long-term sustained drug release characteristics which may function as a novel carrier for long-term anti-inflammation and anti-adhesion to prevent peritendinous adhesions.",2013,,"Hu C, Liu S, Zhang Y, Li B, Yang H, Fan C, Cui W.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.040,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To this end, we fabricated core-shell nanofibrous membranes (CSNMs) with embedded silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/poly(caprolactone) (PCL) shell and hyaluronic acid (HA)/ibuprofen in the core. HA imparted a lubrication effect for smooth tendon gliding and reduced fibroblast attachment, while Ag NPs and ibuprofen functioned as anti-infection and anti-inflammation agents, respectively. CSNMs with a PEG/PCL/Ag shell (PPA) and HA core containing 0% (H/PPA), 10% (HI10/PPA), 30% (HI30/PPA) and 50% (HI50/PPA) ibuprofen were fabricated through co-axial electrospinning and assessed through microscopic, spectroscopic, thermal, mechanical and drug release analyses. Considering nutrient passage through the barrier, the microporous CSNMs exerted the same barrier effect but drastically increased the mass transfer coefficients of bovine serum albumin compared with the commercial anti-adhesive membrane SurgiWrap®. Cell attachment/focal adhesion formation of fibroblasts revealed effective reduction of initial cell attachment on the CSNM surface with minimum cytotoxicity (except HI50/PPA). The anti-bacterial effect against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was verified to be due to the Ag NPs in the membranes. In vivo studies using H/PPA and HI30/PPA CSNMs and SurgiWrap® in a rabbit flexor tendon rupture model demonstrated the improved efficacy of HI30/PPA CSNMs in reducing inflammation and tendon adhesion formation based on gross observation, histological analysis and functional assays. We conclude that HI30/PPA CSNMs can act as a multifunctional barrier membrane to prevent peritendinous adhesion after tendon surgery.<h4>Statement of significance</h4>A multi-functional anti-adhesion barrier membrane that could reduce fibroblasts attachment and penetration while simultaneously prevent post-surgical infection and inflammation is urgently needed. To this end, we prepared electrospun core-shell hyaluronic acid + ibuprofen/polyethylene glycol + polycaprolactone + Ag nanoparticles nanofibrous membranes by co-axial electrospinning as an ideal anti-adhesive membrane. The core-shell structure could meet the need of a desirable anti-adhesion barrier through release of ibuprofen and Ag nanoparticles to reduce infection and inflammation while hyaluronic acid can reduce fibroblasts adhesion.

Herein, we utilize pressurized gas expanded liquid (PGX) technology to produce very high surface area (~200 m<sup>2</sup>/g) alginate scaffolds and describe a method for loading the scaffolds with ibuprofen (via adsorptive precipitation) and crosslinking them (via calcium chelation) to create a hydrogel suitable for wound treatment and hydrophobic drug delivery. The high surface area of the PGX-processed alginate scaffold facilitates >8 wt% loading of ibuprofen into the scaffold and controlled in vitro ibuprofen release over 12-24 h. In vivo burn wound healing assays demonstrate significantly accelerated healing with ibuprofen-loaded PGX-alginate/calcium scaffolds relative to both hydrogel-only and untreated controls, demonstrating the combined benefits of ibuprofen delivery to suppress inflammation as well as the capacity of the PGX-alginate/calcium hydrogel to maintain wound hydration and facilitate continuous calcium release to the wound. The use of PGX technology to produce highly porous scaffolds with increased surface areas, followed by adsorptive precipitation of a hydrophobic drug onto the scaffolds, offers a highly scalable method of creating medicated wound dressings with high drug loadings. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: While medicated hydrogel-based wound dressings offer clear advantages in accelerating wound healing, the inherent incompatibility between conventional hydrogels and many poorly water-soluble drugs of relevance in wound healing remains a challenge. Herein, we leveraged supercritical fluids-based strategies to both process and subsequently impregnate alginate, followed by post-crosslinking to form a hydrogel, to create a very high surface area alginate hydrogel scaffold loaded with high hydrophobic drug contents (here, >8 wt% ibuprofen) without the need for any pore-forming additives.

Because of this, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests avoiding their use in women with postpartum hypertension; however, evidence to support this recommendation is lacking.<h4>Objective</h4>Our goal was to test the hypothesis that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, adversely affect postpartum blood pressure control in women with preeclampsia with severe features.<h4>Study design</h4>At delivery, we randomized women with preeclampsia with severe features to receive around-the-clock oral dosing with either 600 mg of ibuprofen or 650 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Dosing began within 6 hours after delivery and continued until discharge, with opioid analgesics available as needed for breakthrough pain. Study drugs were encapsulated in identical capsules such that patients, nurses, and physicians were masked to study allocation. Exclusion criteria were serum aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >200 mg/dL, serum creatinine >1.0 mg/dL, infectious hepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, age <18 years, or current incarceration. Our primary outcome was the duration of severe-range hypertension, defined as the time (in hours) from delivery to the last blood pressure ≥160/110 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes were time from delivery to last blood pressure ≥150/100 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure, need for antihypertensive medication at discharge, prolongation of hospital stay for blood pressure control, postpartum use of short-acting antihypertensives for acute blood pressure control, and opioid use for breakthrough pain. We analyzed all outcome data according to intention-to-treat principles.<h4>Results</h4>We assessed 154 women for eligibility, of whom 100 met entry criteria, agreed to participate, and were randomized to receive postpartum ibuprofen or acetaminophen for first-line pain control. Seven patients crossed over or did not receive their allocated study drug, and 93 completed the study protocol in their assigned groups. We found no differences in baseline characteristics between groups, including mode of delivery, body mass index, parity, race, chronic hypertension, and maximum blood pressure prior to delivery. We did not find a difference in the duration of severe-range hypertension in the ibuprofen vs acetaminophen groups (35.3 vs 38.0 hours, P = .30).

Inspired by the ""antiskid tires"" with complex chiral patterns, mesoporous silica nanoparticles AT-R@CMSN exhibiting geometrical chiral structure were designed to improve the surface/interface roughness in nanoscale, and employed as the hosting system for insoluble drugs nimesulide (NMS) and ibuprofen (IBU). Once performing the delivery tasks, AT-R@CMSN with rigid skeleton protected the loaded drug and reduced the irritation of drug on gastrointestinal tract (GIT), while their porous structure deprived drug crystal and improved drug release. More importantly, AT-R@CMSN functioned as ""antiskid tire"" to produce higher friction on intestinal mucosa and substantively influenced multiple biological processes, including ""contact"", ""adhesion"", ""retention"", ""permeation"" and ""uptake"", compared to the achiral S@MSN, thereby improving the oral adsorption effectiveness of such drug delivery systems. By engineering AT-R@CMSN to overcome the stability, solubility and permeability bottlenecks of drugs, orally administered NMS or IBU loaded AT-R@CMSN could achieve higher relative bioavailability (705.95% and 444.42%, respectively) and stronger anti-inflammation effect.

The AGEP (acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis) is also reviewed. The aetiological diagnosis of severe non-immediate reactions is difficult, and the value of current allergological testing is not well defined in these cases. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, the empirical risk of drugs to trigger SJS/TEN or DRESS, and the in vivo and in vitro testing of the suspect drug. Skin biopsy confirms that the clinical diagnosis and delayed hypersensitivity tests, especially the patch test and the lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT), may be important to confirm the aetiological diagnosis, in our cases emphasising the latter. These diseases can be life threatening (especially DRESS and TEN) and/or have a high rate of major complications or sequelae (SJS/TEN). The three cases described progressed well without sequelae.

Therefore, we established an ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated drug co-delivery system (Ibu&FK@RNPs), which can target the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and response to the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD. RAGE is highly and specifically expressed on the lesion neurovascular unit of AD, this property helps to improve targeting specificity of the system and reduce unselective distribution in normal brain. Meanwhile, these two drugs can be specifically released in astrocytes of AD lesion in response to high levels of ROS. As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the quantity of A<i>β</i> plaques was decreased. Neurotoxicity was also alleviated with structural regeneration and functional recovery of neurons. Besides, the neuroinflammation dominated by NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway was significantly inhibited with decreased NF-<i>κ</i>B and IL-1<i>β</i> in the brain.

The study consisted of mixing each drug in an aqueous solution with functionalized <i>Sargassum spp</i> in a container under constant agitation. Therefore, this work represents an alternative to solve two of the biggest problems in recent years; first, the reduction of the overpopulation of sargassum through its use for the remediation of the environment. Second is the removal of drug waste used excessively during the COVID-19 pandemic. Liquid samples of the solution were taken at intervals of 10 min and analyzed by fluorescence to determine the concentration of the drug. The sorption capacity for diclofenac, ibuprofen, and paracetamol was 2.46, 2.08, and 1.41 μg/g, corresponding to 98 %, 84 %, and 54 % of removal, respectively. The removal of the three drugs was notably favored by increasing the temperature to 30 and 40 °C, reaching efficiencies close to 100 %. Moreover, the system maintains its effectiveness at various pH values. In addition, the <i>Sargassum</i> used can be reused for up to three cycles without reducing its removal capacity. The wide diversity of organic compounds favors the biosorption of drugs, removing them through various kinetic mechanisms. On the other hand, the <i>Sargassum</i> used in the drugs removal was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, TGA analysis, and scanning electron microscopy before and after removal.

This increased risk was not observed for a sulfonamide COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib), indicating a potential non-enzymatic mechanism for rofexocib. To test this hypothesis, we compared the independent effects of COX-2 inhibitors on human LDL oxidation, an important contributor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The results showed that rofecoxib (100 nM) significantly decreased (>40%, p<0.001) the lag time for LDL conjugated diene formation and increased levels of thiobarbituric-acid-reactive-substances (TBARS) in vitro. The pro-oxidant activity of rofecoxib was dose-dependent and attenuated by 70% (p<0.001) with the antioxidant, Trolox. Rofecoxib and etoricoxib (100 nM) also caused a marked increase (>35%, p<0.001) in non-enzymatic generation of isoprostanes, as measured by mass spectroscopy. Addition of rofecoxib to fresh human plasma reduced the oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) by 34% (p<0.0001). By contrast, other selective (celecoxib, valdecoxib, meloxicam) and non-selective COX inhibitors (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) had no significant effect on LDL oxidation rates or plasma ORAC values, even at suprapharmacologic levels. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that sulfone COX-2 inhibitors interact differently with membrane phospholipids, suggesting a physico-chemical basis for the pro-oxidant activity. These results demonstrate that sulfone COX-2 inhibitors increase the susceptibility of biological lipids to oxidative modification through a non-enzymatic process.

Astrocyte-enriched extracellular vesicles (AEEVs) facilitate cell-to-cell communication and - among other functions - regulate inflammation and metabolism via microribonucleic acids (miRNAs). Dysfunctions in reward-related processing and inflammation have been proposed to be critical pathophysiological pathways in individuals with mood disorders. This investigation examined whether changes in AEEV cargo induced by an anti-inflammatory agent results in inflammatory modulation that is associated with reward-related processing. Data from a double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures study in healthy volunteers were used to examine the effects of AEEV miRNAs on brain activation during reward-related processing. In three separate visits, healthy participants (N = 20) received a single dose of either placebo, 200 mg, or 600 mg of ibuprofen, completed the monetary incentive delay task during functional magnetic resonance imaging, and provided a blood sample for cytokine and AEEV collection. AEEV miRNA content profiling showed that ibuprofen dose-dependently increased AEEV miR-23b-3p expression with greater increase following the 600 mg administration than placebo. Those individuals who received 600 mg and showed the highest miR-23b-3p expression also showed the (a) lowest serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) concentrations; and had the (b) highest striatal brain activation during reward anticipation.

The aqua crude plant extract is valuable in treating oxidative stress and microbes-related diseases. In this study, bioactive metabolites from the leaf of the plant were tentatively identified using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Raw LCMS data were processed using MZmine3.6. Pyrenophorol, N-[1-(diethylamino)-3-morpholin-4-ylpropan-2-yl]-2,2-diphenylacetamide, losartan, and isoarthonin, (2E,4E)-N-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]dodeca-2,4-dienamide were among the many metabolites identified from the plant studied using LCMS-MZmine 3.6.

With a global prevalence of about 0.3%-1% RA is 3-5 times more prevalent in women than in men. There is no known cure for RA; the ultimate goal for treatment of RA is to provide symptomatic relief. The treatment regimen for RA involves frequent drug administration and high doses of NSAIDs such as indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, celecoxib, etorcoxib. These potent drugs often have off target effects which drastically decreases patient compliance. Moreover, conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory have many formulation challenges like low solubility and permeability, poor bioavailability, degradation by gastrointestinal enzymes, food interactions and toxicity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have turned to topical route of drug administration, which has superior patience compliance and they also bypass the first past effect experienced with conventional oral administration. Furthermore, to enhance the permeation of drug through the layers of the skin and reach the site of inflammation, nanosized carriers have been designed such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, niosomes, ethosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles and transferosomes. These drug delivery systems are non-toxic and have high drug encapsulation efficiency and they also provide sustained release of drug.

This study details the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel series of twelve hybrid conjugates (7a-l) that combine a curcumin-mimic scaffold (3,5-diarylidene-4-piperidinone), ibuprofen, and amino acid linkers. By employing a molecular hybridization approach, the synthesized compounds were thoroughly characterized and assessed for their antiproliferative activity against diverse cancer cell lines, including A431 (skin), HCT116 (colon), and MCF7 (breast). Flow cytometry results suggest that these potent hybrids induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Among them, compound 7b emerged as the most effective candidate. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that 7b exhibited superior efficacy compared to cisplatin in melanoma models, significantly reducing tumor growth and improving survival rates.

The main drawback of NSAIDs is that they induce gastric complications such as peptic ulceration and injury to the intestine. Four NSAIDs, indomethacin, diclofenac, aspirin, and ibuprofen were selected to induce gastropathy in mouse models. It was found that the addition of C-terminal half of bovine lactoferrin (C-lobe) reversed the NSAID-induced injuries to the extent of 47-70% whereas the coadministration of C-lobe prevented it significantly. The C-lobe was prepared proteolytically using serine proteases. The binding studies of C-lobe with NSAIDs showed that these compounds bind to C-lobe with affinities ranging from 2.6 to 4.8 x 10(-4) M. The complexes of C-lobe were prepared with the above four NSAIDs. All four complexes were crystallized and their detailed three-dimensional structures were determined using x-ray crystallographic method. The structures showed that all the four NSAID molecules bound to C-lobe at the newly identified ligand binding site in C-lobe that is formed involving two alpha-helices, alpha10 and alpha11. The ligand binding site is separated from the well known iron binding site by the longest and the most stable beta-strand, betaj, in the structure. Similar results were also obtained with the full length lactoferrin molecule.

Furthermore, ibuprofen interactions shift the thermodynamic equilibrium from fibril-like locked states to disordered docked states. Ibuprofen's anti-aggregation effect is explained by its competition with incoming Abeta peptides for the same binding site located on the fibril edge.

Percent recovery of sucrose was calculated based on analyses of urine collected overnight; the lactulose/mannitol ratio and percent recovery of sucralose were based on analyses of urine samples collected over a 24-hour period.<h4>Results</h4>When we controlled for age, sex, and family membership, siblings of children with IBS or FAP had increased small bowel permeability (urinary lactulose/mannitol ratio) vs controls (P = .004). There was no difference in gastroduodenal (percent sucrose recovery) or colonic (percent sucralose recovery) permeability between groups. Similarly, parents of children with IBS or FAP also had increased small bowel permeability, compared with parents of controls (P = .015), with no differences in gastric or colonic permeability. After administration of ibuprofen, gastroduodenal and small bowel permeability tended to be greater in IBS or FAP siblings (P = .08) and gastroduodenal permeability tended to be greater in IBS or FAP parents (P = .086).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Siblings and parents of children with IBS or FAP have increased baseline small intestinal permeability compared with control children and their parents.

Warfarin, imipramine, and ibuprofen were used as model analytes in this study. It was found that greater than 95% extraction of all these drugs could be achieved in as little as 250 ms on HSA microcolumns. The retained drug fraction was then eluted from the same column under isocratic conditions, giving elution in less than 40 s when working at 4.5 mL/min. The chromatographic behavior of this system gave a good fit with that predicted by computer simulations based on a reversible, saturable model for the binding of an injected drug with immobilized HSA. The free fractions measured by this method were found to be comparable to those determined by ultrafiltration, and equilibrium constants estimated by this approach gave good agreement with literature values. Advantages of this method include its speed and the relatively low cost of microcolumns that contain HSA. The ability of HSA to bind many types of drugs also creates the possibility of using the same affinity microcolumn to study and measure the free fractions for a variety of pharmaceutical agents. These properties make this technique appealing for use in drug-binding studies and in the high-throughput screening of new drug candidates.",2010,,"Mallik R, Yoo MJ, Briscoe CJ, Hage DS.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2849903?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In vivo experiments in humans are not always possible for ethical, practical, or economic reasons, especially in the first part of the drug development. It is necessary to develop alternative methods using accessible and reproducible surrogates for in vivo human skin. The in vitro methodologies using biological membranes (human and animal skin) are recognized and well accepted as an alternative but present high inter- and intra-individual variability. Therefore, the formation of synthetic membranes has been studied to obtain skin- mimicking models for permeation studies. The aim of this work is to create lanolin-based artificial membranes that can mimic the absorption through the skin of compounds applied topically. A series of synthetic membranes using two different types of lanolin (water-extracted (WE) and solvent-extracted (SE)) were prepared. Next, the in vitro release test of three drugs (diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen and lidocaine) was performed on artificial membranes and on porcine skin placed on Franz cells. The percentage of release, flux, permeability coefficient, lag time, area under the curve, maximal concentration and time were determined for each compound in the different types of membrane. The results showed that lanolin membranes presented a strong diminution of permeability compared to most artificial membranes, leading to a very similar permeability to that of skin. The SE and WE membranes showed a diminution of transepidermal water loss and permeability of compounds compared with membranes alone. The results from WE membranes were similar to those found for the skin. The lanolin membranes were not capable of perfectly mimicking permeation through the skin, but they did have the same rank order of drug penetration as the skin. It may be deduced from these tests that these systems provide more reliable results for compounds with low to medium lipophilicity. The results demonstrated that new lanolin-based artificial membranes have the potential to be exploited as screening models for determining the permeability of a compound destined to be topically delivered.",2020,,"Alonso C, Collini I, Carrer V, Barba C, Martí M, Coderch L.",http://hdl.handle.net/10261/212237,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Dexibuprofen (DEX) is routinely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, acute postoperative pain, primary dysmenorrheal, and in lower back pain. However, it is poorly water soluble with compromised bioavailability, and hence has limited therapeutic activity. In order to overcome these issues, we studied the formulation and characterization of nanoemulsion based system i.e nanoemulgel of DEX. This study aimed to prepare topical nanoemulgel containing 2 % DEX and solubility-enhanced DEX via ternary inclusion complexation (DEX-SE-T) and to compare it with commercially available 5 % Ibuprofen gel as there is no topical formulation of DEX is available in the market currently. A pseudoternary phase diagram was constructed using the spontaneous water titration method. Blank and drug-loaded nanoemulgel were prepared using a high-speed homogenization method. All the formulations were evaluated in terms of particle size, pH, conductivity, viscosity, zeta potential, and ex vivo drug permeation. DEX loaded nanoemulgel yield enhanced in vitro skin permeation than the commercially available 5 % ibuprofen gel. The optimized nanoemulgel formulation (DEX-SE-T) was tested in in vivo anti-inflammatory models including cotton pellets-induced abdominal granuloma (chronic inflammation) and carrageenan-induced paw edema (acute inflammation). DEX-SE-T loaded nanoemulgel has improved in vivo anti-inflammatory activity as compared to ibuprofen gel.

Whilst the substrate capacity of this transporter is broad, studies have largely been limited to small peptides and peptide-like drugs. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a diverse range of drugs can be targeted towards transport by PepT1 using a hydrolysis resistant carrier. Eleven prodrugs were synthesized by conjugating modified dipeptides containing a thioamide bond to the approved drugs ibuprofen, gabapentin, propofol, aspirin, acyclovir, nabumetone, atenolol, zanamivir, baclofen and mycophenolate. Except for the aspirin and acyclovir prodrugs, which were unstable in the assay conditions and were not further studied, the prodrugs were tested for affinity and transport by PepT1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes: binding affinities ranged from approximately 0.1 to 2 mM. Compounds which showed robust transport in an oocyte trans-stimulation assay were then tested for transcellular transport in Caco-2 cell monolayers: all five tested prodrugs showed significant PepT1-mediated transcellular uptake. Finally, the ibuprofen and propofol prodrugs were tested for absorption in rats: following oral dosing the intact prodrugs and free ibuprofen were measured in the plasma.

Herein, we designed and synthesized several conjugates via covalently binding NSAIDs to 5'-OH of GS-441524 through ester bonds. The ibuprofen conjugate, ATV041, exhibited potent in vitro anti-coronaviral efficacy against four zoonotic coronaviruses in the alpha- and beta-genera. Oral-dosed ATV041 resulted in favorable bioavailability and rapid tissue distribution of GS-441524 and ibuprofen.

Complexation of ibuprofen by HPCD was demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry, while solubilities were determined using HPLC. A linear (r2>0.999) relationship was found between ibuprofen solubility and HPCD concentration. For subsequent experiments, the concentration of ibuprofen was held constant at the solubility in 10% HPCD (10.6 mg/ml), while the HPCD concentration varied from 0 to 20% (w/w). In vitro transdermal permeation experiments demonstrated a parabolic relationship between transdermal kinetic parameters and HPCD concentration, with maximum values for both flux and skin accumulation occurring with the 10% HPCD formulation.

Current CF treatment strategies are focused on targeted drug delivery to the lungs. Novel inhalable drug therapies require an in vitro CF model that appropriately mimics the in vivo CF lung environment to better understand drug delivery and transport across the CF epithelium, and predict drug therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the appropriate air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method of the CuFi-1 (CF cell line) compared to the NuLi-1 (healthy cell line) cells to be used as in vitro models of CF airway epithelia. Furthermore, drug transport on both CuFi-1 and NuLi-1 was investigated to determine whether these cell lines could be used to study transport of drugs used in CF treatment using Ibuprofen (the only anti-inflammatory drug currently approved for CF) as a model drug. Differentiating characteristics specific to airway epithelia such as mucus production, inflammatory response and tight junction formation at two seeding densities (Low and High) were assessed throughout an 8-week ALI culture period. This study demonstrated that both the NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines fully differentiate in ALI culture with significant mucus secretion, IL-6 and IL-8 production, and functional tight junctions at week 8. Additionally, the High seeding density was found to alter the phenotype of the NuLi-1 cell line.

The morphological characteristic of IBU-NPs showed porous clusters. Analysis results indicated that the prepared IBU-NPs have low crystallinity. Residual amounts of ethanol and chloroform were 170 and 9.6ppm, respectively, which were less than the ICH limit for class II.

These differences are likely due to significantly thicker dorsal skin increasing absorption path length, and also possibly owing to lipoid secretions on the dorsum providing an additional diffusional barrier.

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.",2011,,"Xing B, Li H, Wang H, Mukhopadhyay D, Fisher D, Gilpin CJ, Li S.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.06.018,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

As the main participant of neuroinflammation, the polarization of microglia (MG) could influence the development of neuroinflammation.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to observe the impact of YHD on microglia (MG) polarization and neuroinflammation to delay the onset and progression of AD.<h4>Methods</h4>In vivo experiment, four-month senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) were used as the model group, the SAMR1 mice of the same age were used as the control group. In YHD group, 6.24 g/kg YHD was intragastrically administrated continuously for 12 weeks, and Ibuprofen 0.026 g/kg in positive control group. Morris Water Maze test was used to evaluate the learning and memory ability, Nissl's staining and immunofluorescence double staining for neuron damage and MG M1/M2 polarization, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for neuroinflammation biomarkers in hippocampus, Western blot for key protein expression of TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway. In vitro experiments, 10 μM/l Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> induced BV-2 cell model was used to re-verify the effect of YHD regulating MG polarization to reduce neuroinflammation. Also, TREM2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to clarify the key target of YHD.<h4>Results</h4>YHD could improve the learning and memory ability of SAMP8 mice evaluated by the Morris Water Maze test. Like Ibuprofen, YHD could regulate the M1/M2 polarization of MG and the levels of neuroinflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-10 in hippocampus, and relieve neuroinflammation and neuron loss. In addition, YHD could also regulate the expression of PU.1, TREM2, p-NF-κB P65 in the TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway.

This study modified luffa to create the LF@ppy@LDH nanocomposite, combining luffa, polypyrrole, and layered double hydroxides to efficiently remove ibuprofen from water. Techniques like FE-SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD confirmed the modification. To optimize adsorption efficiency, factors such as contact time ( C t i m e ) , adsorbent dosage ( A d ) , drug concentration ( D c ) , temperature ( θ ) , stirring rate ( S r ) , and pH were carefully fine-tuned to maximize efficiency. The highest ibuprofen removal occurred at pH 5, with an adsorption capacity of 44.306 mg/g at 298 K. The Temkin isotherm model, which points to chemisorption as the mechanism, accurately depicted the adsorption process with a high correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.984).

We convened a multidisciplinary panel to develop consensus recommendations for opioid prescribing after common dental procedures. We used a three-step modified Delphi method to develop a consensus recommendation for outpatient opioid prescribing for 14 common dental procedures. The multi-institution, multidisciplinary panel represented seven relevant stakeholder groups (oral surgeons, periodontists, endodontists, general dentists, general surgeons, oral surgery residents, and oral surgery patients). The panel determined the minimum and maximum number of opioid tablets a clinician should consider prescribing. For all 14 surgical procedures, ibuprofen was recommended as initial therapy. The maximum number of opioid tablets recommended varied by procedure (overall median = 5 tablets, range = 0-15 tablets).

Skin permeation rates and lag times of ibuprofen were evaluated using the Franz-type diffusion cell in order to optimize the gel formulation. The permeation rate of ibuprofen significantly increased in proportion to the drug concentration, but significantly decreased in proportion to POE(5)cetyl/oleyl ether concentration. Ethanol concentration was inversely proportional to the lag time. The pharmacokinetic properties of the optimized formulation were compared with those of two marketed products in rats.

In order to get a sustained delivery of NSAIDs without burst, hydrogel degradable microspheres were prepared by co-polymerization of a methacrylic derivative of ibuprofen with oligo(ethylene-glycol) methacrylate and poly(PLGA-PEG) dimethacrylate as degradable crosslinker. Microspheres (40-100 μm) gave a low yield of ibuprofen release in saline buffer (≈2% after 3 months). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that intact ibuprofen was regenerated indicating that ester hydrolysis occurred at the carboxylic acid position of ibuprofen. Dialysis of release medium followed by alkaline hydrolysis show that in saline buffer ester hydrolysis occurred at other positions in the polymer matrix leading to the release of water-soluble polymers (>6-8000 Da) conjugated with ibuprofen showing that degradation and drug release are simultaneous. By considering the free and conjugated ibuprofen, 13% of the drug is released in 3 months. In vitro, ibuprofen-loaded MS inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 in articular cartilage and capsule explants challenged with lipopolysaccharides.

Moreover, the incorporation of NLC in hydrogels of mucoadhesive polymers resulted in preparations with desirable rheological features as well as texture (firmness and adhesiveness) and mucoadhesive properties, which could benefit the therapeutic efficacy, by increasing the residence time and easiness for topical application in the buccal mucosa.

The model integrates pressure-driven, coupled laminar flow through the MN lumen and skin tissue, employing the Beavers-Joseph interfacial condition at the HMN tip and skin interface to represent the transition between free flow (lumen) and porous regions (tissue). For modelling purposes, IBU is loaded into a porous tablet within the HMN reservoir, which, in practice, can increase the shelf life of the drug formulation and provide greater ease of handling. Drug transport in the system is modelled using the convection-diffusion equation for diluted species (i.e., ignoring any inter-species interactions) coupled with a pharmacokinetic component to predict systemic absorption of the drug. Parametric analyses have revealed that MN geometry, drug loading, and skin permeability significantly influence delivery efficiency. Notably, an increase in the drug-loaded tablet diameter leads to higher fluid velocity within the tablet, enhancing drug release. Among the key design parameters, the number of MNs and lumen diameter exhibit the strongest effect on the IBU (drug) permeability, with the permeability nearly doubling when the needle count increases four times from 9 to 36. In contrast, the pitch has a relatively minor impact. Inlet pressure emerges as a critical design factor: while higher pressures (e.g., 40 kPa) improve IBU permeability, they also reduce delivery control and compromise pharmacodynamic stability. The results indicate that maintaining moderate pressure levels enables a more balanced and sustained therapeutic effect, supporting the need for optimised delivery parameters tailored to specific drug characteristics and patient safety.",2025,,"Prakash R, Nadda R, Das DB, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2025.126309,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In fact, developing drug formulations with high encapsulation efficiency remains a challenging area of research, particularly in the context of targeted therapies that are often hindered by issues related to drug delivery. There is an emerging need for effective drugs with no adverse side effects that restrict their delivery. Several methods of drug encapsulation are available, including microencapsulation, liposomal encapsulation, polymer encapsulation, hydrogel encapsulation, and molecular encapsulation. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry has commercialized many encapsulated drugs, such as anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen, dexamethasone), high blood pressure drugs (valsartan, azilsartan), proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole), anti-cancer (carboplatin, carmustine, cisplatin, trastuzumab, cytarabine, paclitaxel, doxorubicin (DOX), vincristine) antiparasitic (amphotericin), antifungal (clotrimazole), and hormonal (melatonin (MLT))). Indeed, the encapsulation approach offers distinct limitations and opportunities. It can render drugs more convenient and user-friendly for various therapeutic purposes and help to enhance their performance, functionality, and effectiveness. This comprehensive review examines the encapsulation technologies employed in the pharmaceutical industry, highlighting notable examples of encapsulated drugs that demonstrate their mechanism of action and potential therapeutic effects in vitro, in vivo, and through clinical trials, with relevance to various diseases.",2025,,"Bakrim S, Khalid A, Abdalla AN, Ibrahim SE, Hamza SMA, El Omari N, Wen GK, Lee LH, Bouyahya A.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2025.126470,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

While the symptoms of these are many, the most prominent among them being migraines, heart failure, dyspnea, and chest pain thereby making a diagnosis all the more difficult.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 53-year-old woman presented with a recent onset of headaches with aura. The latter was triggered by exercise and physical exertion. Taking Ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily provided relief to the patient. Headaches were associated with photophobia and nausea.<h4>Clinical discussion</h4>The patient had the typical triad of symptoms, namely (i) obstructive (light headedness, near syncope, dyspnea, chest pain), (ii) embolic (transient ischemic attacks - TIA, peripheral arterial claudication), and (iii) constitutional (fever, malaise, weight loss). Cerebral infarction is the most frequent complication. The patient had multiple embolic acute and sub-acute infarcts.

The disease's complicated pathophysiology makes it difficult to develop effective therapies, necessitating research into novel therapeutic options. Molecular hybridization is a strategy that can be used to develop new drugs that act on two or multiple targets and represents an interesting option to be explored for the treatment of complex diseases. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a hybrid mutual prodrug of ibuprofen and acetaminophen (IBPA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from SSc patients, and in an in vivo model of SSc induced in BALB/c mice by intradermal injections of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) for 6 weeks. The mice were treated at the same time with daily intraperitoneal injections of IBPA (40 mg/kg). Pulmonary and skin fibrosis as well as immune responses were evaluated.

However, recent studies have demonstrated the antiviral effects of niclosamide against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. In this study, we developed and validated a quantitative analysis method for the determination of niclosamide in rat and dog plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and used this method for pharmacokinetic studies. Biological samples were prepared using the protein precipitation method with acetonitrile. Ibuprofen was used as an internal standard. The mobile phase used to quantify niclosamide in rat or dog plasma consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate in distilled water-acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) or 5 mM ammonium acetate-methanol (30:70, v/v). An XDB-phenyl column (5 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm) and a Kinetex® C18 column (5 µm, 2.1 × 500 mm) were used as reverse-phase liquid chromatography columns for rat and dog plasma analyses, respectively. Niclosamide and ibuprofen were detected under multiple reaction monitoring conditions using the electrospray ionization interface running in the negative ionization mode. Niclosamide presented linearity in the concentration ranges of 1-3000 ng/mL (r = 0.9967) and 1-1000 ng/mL (r = 0.9941) in rat and dog plasma, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision values were < 7.40% and < 6.35%, respectively, for rat plasma, and < 3.95% and < 4.01%, respectively, for dog plasma. The intra- and inter-day accuracy values were < 4.59% and < 6.63%, respectively, for rat plasma, and < 12.1% and < 10.9%, respectively, for dog plasma. In addition, the recoveries of niclosamide ranged between 87.8 and 99.6% and 102-104% for rat and dog plasma, respectively. Niclosamide was stable during storage under various conditions (three freeze-thaw cycles, 6 h at room temperature, long-term, and processed samples). A reliable LC-MS/MS method for niclosamide detection was successfully used to perform pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs. Niclosamide presented dose-independent pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 0.3-3 mg/kg after intravenous administration, and drug exposure in rats and dogs after oral administration was very low.

Aqueous ibuprofen solubility is dependent on pH increasing solubility when increasing pH. The very low aqueous solubility of ibuprofen can lead to a segregation of the drug in to microdomains and possible crystallization which will affect the release profile even leading to possible damage of the mucous membrane of the stomach. Therefore, homopolymers and copolymers of N-ethylmorpholine methacrylamide (EMA) and N, N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) hydrogels have been prepared to be applied as matrices for ibuprofen release as a method for minimizing these issues. The hydrogels were loaded with ibuprofen and the release over time was tested at 37°C and at different pH values: 2, 5 and 7.4. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) was performed in order to identify the stretching vibrations of the carbonyl group for each component. Dissolution of the ibuprofen from the formulations at different pHs was studied using the ATR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging. The results showed that for DMA hydrogels, most of ibuprofen was released as non crystalline ibuprofen at pH 7.4 but it was not able to prevent crystallization at pH 2 and 5. In contrast, the EMA hydrogels were able to prevent crystallization of the ibuprofen at all pHs. Finally, it was demonstrated that there is a minimum concentration at which the polymer becomes ineffective.",2011,,"Velasco D, Danoux ChB, Redondo JA, Elvira C, San Román J, Wray PS, Kazarian SG.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.10.015,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen sodium was used as the model here and was successfully formulated at approximately 50% w/w in the dry state using the copolymer poly(methylvinylether/maleic acid). These MNs were robust and effectively penetrated skin in vitro, dissolving rapidly to deliver the incorporated drug. The delivery of 1.5mg ibuprofen sodium, the theoretical mass of ibuprofen sodium contained within the dry MN alone, was vastly exceeded, indicating extensive delivery of the drug loaded into the baseplates. Indeed in in vitro transdermal delivery studies, approximately 33mg (90%) of the drug initially loaded into the arrays was delivered over 24h. Iontophoresis produced no meaningful increase in delivery. Biocompatibility studies and in vivo rat skin tolerance experiments raised no concerns. The blood plasma ibuprofen sodium concentrations achieved in rats (263μgml(-1) at the 24h time point) were approximately 20 times greater than the human therapeutic plasma level. By simplistic extrapolation of average weights from rats to humans, a MN patch design of no greater than 10cm(2) could cautiously be estimated to deliver therapeutically-relevant concentrations of ibuprofen sodium in humans.

Here we demonstrate the strategy of enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) by designing a phosphorylated peptide-drug (IBF-HYD-GFFpY) precursor through the ester bond to release active drugs at the target site. Meanwhile, the in vivo assembly can be achieved by the catalysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the tear fluid for ocular drug delivery efficiently. The in vitro enzymatic experiments indicate that the dephosphorylation of IBF-HYD-GFFpY occurs firstly with the yield of IBF-HYD-GFFY which subsequently self-assembles into the supramolecular hydrogel to afford sustained drug release over 96 h. In the treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated Raw 264.7 macrophages, IBF-HYD-GFFpY exerts the more potent anti-inflammatory efficacy than that of free ibuprofen (IBF) at the concentration of 200 μM. Moreover, the aqueous solution of IBF-HYD-GFFpY via topical instillation hardly causes ocular irritation, and displays longer precorneal retention compared to the conventional eye drop formulation. In addition, in the in vivo study, a rabbit model of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) evidences the comparable therapeutic efficacy of IBF-HYD-GFFpY eye drops with that of clinically used 0.1 wt% diclofenac (DIC) sodium eye drops by the reduction of macrophage and leukocyte influx.

However, cell viability and subsequent tissue regeneration might be severely interfered with the unrestricted release and the locally excessive concentration of anti-inflammatory drugs. Herein, we report a double-layered membrane with sustained and uni-directional drug delivery features to prevent peritendinous adhesion without hampering the healing outcome. A vortex-assisted electrospinning system in combination with ibuprofen (IBU)-in-water emulsion was utilized to fabricate IBU-loaded poly-ʟ-lactic-acid (PLLA) fiber bundle membrane (PFB-IBU) as the anti-adhesion layer. The resultant highly porous structure, oleophilic and hydrophobic nature of PLLA fibers enabled in situ loading of IBU with a concentration gradient across the membrane thickness. Aligned collagen nanofibers were further deposited at the low IBU concentration side of the membrane for regulating cell growth and achieving uni-directional release of IBU. Drug release kinetics showed that the release amount of IBU from the high concentration side reached 79.32% at 14 d, while it was only 0.35% at the collagen side. Therefore, fibroblast proliferation at the high concentration side was successfully inhibited without affecting the oriented growth of tendon-derived stem cells at the other side. In vivo evaluation of the rat Achilles adhesion model confirmed the successful peritendinous anti-adhesion of our double-layered membrane, in that the macrophage recruitment, the inflammatory factor secretion and the deposition of pathological adhesion markers such as α-SMA and COL-III were all inhibited, which greatly improved the peritendinous fibrosis and restored the motor function of tendon.",2024,,"Deng J, Yao Z, Wang S, Zhang X, Zhan L, Wang T, Yu W, Zeng J, Wu J, Fu S, Wu S, Ouyang Y, Huang C.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2024.06.046,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, NSAIDs induce gastrointestinal damage, alter renal function, and decrease cardiovascular function, which could compromise thermoregulation and increase Tc. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of NSAIDs on Tc in exercising, adult humans.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, and Google Scholar for literature published up to November 2020. We conducted a quality assessment review using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Nine articles achieved a score ≥ seven to be included in the review.<h4>Results</h4>Seven studies found aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen had no effect (p > .05) on Tc during walking, running, or cycling for ≤ 90 min in moderate to hot environments. Two studies found significant Tc changes. In one investigation, 81 mg of aspirin for 7-10 days prior to exercise significantly increased Tc during cycling (p < .001); final Tc at the end of exercise = 38.3 ± 0.1 °C vs. control = 38.1 ± 0.1 °C. In contrast, participants administered 50 mg rofecoxib for 6 days experienced significantly lower Tc during 45 min of cycling compared to placebo (NSAID Tc range ≈ 36.7-37.2 °C vs control ≈ 37.3-37.8 °C, p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>There are limited quality studies examining NSAID effects on Tc during exercise in humans. The majority suggest taking non-selective NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin) 1-14 days before exercise does not significantly affect Tc during exercise.

However, microdiscectomy fails to address annulus fibrosus (AF) defects, increasing the risk of recurrent herniation. Current therapeutic strategies for this condition remain limited in efficacy. The lack of repair following injury and unresolved inflammation can further damage the IVD function, ultimately leading to irreversible IVD degeneration. Therefore, the development of an AF adhesive capable of both mechanically stabilizing annular fissures and enabling localized anti-inflammatory drug delivery emerges as a promising strategy to address this clinical challenge.<h4>Methods</h4>The developed AF adhesive system, designated as STIG, is formulated from silk fibroin, tannic acid, ibuprofen, and guanidine hydrochloride (GuCl). A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on STIG, encompassing its microstructure, composition, injectability, tissue adhesion, rheological properties, and biocompatibility. To assess anti-inflammatory efficacy, an <i>in vitro</i> inflammatory microenvironment is established via lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated AF cells. For <i>in vivo</i> validation, a rat model of IVD degeneration is surgically induced through puncturing the AF to simulate nucleus pulposus (NP) herniation. This experimental framework enables evaluation of STIG's ability to prevent NP protrusion, modulate inflammatory responses, and delay IVD degeneration.<h4>Results</h4>In the STIG system, GuCl serves the role of a hydrogen bond disruptor, facilitating its release into bodily fluids, which in turn allows for the reformation of hydrogen bonds. This property endows STIG with the ability to transition from an injectable, low-stiffness state to a high-stiffness adhesive gel upon contact with water. The inclusion of ibuprofen in the adhesive effectively curbs the production of inflammatory mediators and the breakdown of extracellular matrix constituents. In a rat tail model, STIG effectively preserves the NP water content, maintains the disc height index, and safeguards the structural integrity of the IVD post-surgery.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings highlight STIG's potential as a promising therapeutic solution for sealing AF fissures and preventing IVD degeneration.<h4>The translational potential of this article</h4>STIG shows significant clinical potential in spinal surgery. It offers a novel approach to reduce the recurrence rate post-microdiscectomy and improving long-term patient outcomes.",2025,,"Wang H, Li M, Yang J, Liu Z, Shi S, Liu D, Hong Y, Liu H, Chen S, Li J, Chen S, Li B.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2025.08.004,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen (IBP) is one of the most commonly available over-the-counter pharmaceuticals in the world. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of IBP are thought to arise from inhibition of COX-2 rather than COX-1. While an X-ray crystal structure of IBP bound to COX-1 has been solved, no such structure exists for the cognate isoform COX-2. We have determined the crystal structure of muCOX-2 with a racemic mixture of (R/S)-IBP. Our structure reveals that only the S-isomer of IBP was bound, indicating that the S-isomer possesses higher affinity for COX-2 than the R-isomer.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) has been shown to increase length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. Because the clinical behavior of PAF parallels that of inflammation following surgery, we investigated the effect of the inflammatory mediator arachidonic acid on the electrical behavior of normal atrial tissue in vitro and assessed the efficacy of the topical application of anti-inflammatory drugs at suppressing PAF in an animal model.<h4>Methods</h4>To study changes in electrical behavior from inflammation, the conduction properties of six normal canine right atrial appendages were quantified as a function of the direction of impulse propagation with and without 80 mum arachidonic acid. To study the effect of topical anti-inflammatory drugs, 24 adult mongrel dogs were prepared according to the model of sterile talc pericarditis. Nine dogs received talc alone (T), seven received talc combined with 600 mg ibuprofen (T + I), and eight received talc combined with 10 mg methylprednisolone (T + M). Three days following preparation, programmed electrical stimulation was performed to quantify conduction characteristics and to attempt the induction of atrial fibrillation (AF).<h4>Results</h4>In vitro, arachidonic acid produced an anisotropic and rapidly reversible 36.1 +/- 3.4% (P = 0.01) decrease in conduction velocity transverse to the long axis only. In vivo, both ibuprofen and methylprednisolone significantly reduced the incidence of sustained AF (from 56 to 0% T + I and 12% T + M, respectively, P = 0.02). No differences in conduction velocities or refractory periods were seen during sinus rhythm among the groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Acute inflammation as mimicked by arachidonic acid slows conduction anisotropically, mainly transverse to the long axis of the atrial myocardial fibers. This may set the stage for reentry. Preventing inflammation in vivo by the topical application of anti-inflammatory drugs supports this hypothesis, suggesting a possible role for inflammation in the genesis of postoperative atrial fibrillation and shedding light on the mechanism underlying PAF.",2006,,"Tselentakis EV, Woodford E, Chandy J, Gaudette GR, Saltman AE.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2006.03.024,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although the etiopathogenesis of BD remains unknown, immune-mediated mechanisms play a major role in the development of the disease. BD patients present leukocyte infiltration in the mucocutaneous lesions as well as neutrophil hyperactivation. In contrast to neutrophils, whose involvement in the pathogenesis of BD has been extensively studied, the biology of monocytes during BD is less well known. In this study, we analyzed the phenotype and function of circulating monocytes of 38 BD patients from Hospital of Braga. In addition, we evaluated the impact of inflammatory and metabolomic plasma environment on monocyte biology. We observed a worsening of mitochondrial function, with lower mitochondrial mass and increased ROS production, on circulating monocytes of BD patients. Incubation of monocytes from healthy donors with the plasma of BD patients mimicked the observed phenotype, strongly suggesting the involvement of serum mediators. BD patients, regardless of their symptoms, had higher serum pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IP-10 levels and IL-1β/IL-1RA ratio. Untargeted metabolomic analysis identified a dysregulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism on BD patients, where a significant reduction of phospholipids was observed concomitantly with an increase of lysophospholipids and fatty acids. These observations converged to an enhanced phospholipase A2 (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activation. Indeed, inhibition of PLA<sub>2</sub> with dexamethasone or the downstream cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme with ibuprofen was able to significantly revert the mitochondrial dysfunction observed on monocytes of BD patients.

These samples were collected from Indian and KSA local supermarkets to ensure consistency in their therapeutic effects.<h4>Methods</h4>EOs were extracted from Indian and KSA <i>A. subulatum</i> fruit samples using a hydro-distillation method and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>) was determined using minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration methods. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were determined using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-induced free radical assay, and a bovine albumin inhibitory assay, respectively. These analyses were performed to evaluate the pharmacological activities of the substances.<h4>Results</h4>GC-MS retention times of both samples demonstrated 56 bioactive ingredients with different percentages. The principal bioactive compounds in the Indian and Saudi Arabian EO samples were 1,8-cineole (44.24% and 46.22%, respectively), α-terpineol (7.47% and 7.04%, respectively), terpinen-4-ol (5.01% and 4.83%, respectively), geraniol D (4.05% and 3.54%, respectively), and β-pinene (3.38% and 3.98%, respectively). Superior antimicrobial activity against the selected strains was observed for both samples, with an MIC range of 0.5%-1%. Antioxidant assays demonstrated moderate activity in both samples. Moreover, the Indian and Saudi Arabian samples exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values of 53.12% and 55.26 μg/mL, respectively, in albumin denaturation inhibition assays.

Hydrophobic anti-inflammatory drugs could be fully loaded on the electrospinning membrane through the electrospinning process, which can better prevent tendon adhesion. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) could promote tendon healing. However, the bioactivity of free bFGF is easily inactivated, therefore, a suitable carrier is needed. As a carrier, hydrogel has little effect on the bioactivity of the protein drugs. In this work, a poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) electrospun membrane loaded with ibuprofen (IBU) was prepared and named EMI.

Cisplatin (CDDP) is a representative platinum drug in the treatment of breast cancer, however, its therapeutic application is often constrained by systemic toxicity and the frequent onset of chemoresistance. Here, we introduce a novel charge-adaptive nanoprodrug system, referred to as PP@, engineered to respond to tumor-specific conditions. This platform was constructed by conjugating ibuprofen and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic termini of an amphiphilic dendrimer, respectively, enabling the formation of uniform and stable nanostructures through spontaneous self-assembly. Importantly, PP@ undergoes charge reversal in response to acidic pH and elevated glutathione levels (GSH), facilitating deeper tumor penetration. Cisplatin was subsequently encapsulated within the nanoprodrug to yield the PP@-based CDDP nanoformulation (PP@CDDP). The physicochemical properties and therapeutic performance of PP@CDDP were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrated that PP@CDDP significantly improves cellular uptake, suppresses drug efflux, and reduces intracellular GSH levels, collectively contributing to prolonged drug retention at the tumor site. In vivo studies further confirmed that PP@CDDP significantly improved the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin, as evidenced by marked inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis, along with a favorable safety profile.

It also serves as an agonist for the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR109A. Nicotinic acid is widely used at high doses as a lipid-lowering drug, which is associated with an ocular side effect known as niacin maculopathy. Here we investigated the mechanism by which nicotinate is transferred into retina across the inner blood-retinal barrier (BRB). In vivo the blood-to-retina transport of [(3)H]-nicotinate was studied using the carotid artery injection technique. The characteristics of nicotinate transport at the inner BRB were examined in a conditionally immortalized rat retinal capillary endothelial cell line (TR-iBRB2), an in vitro model of inner BRB. The expression of transporters in TR-iBRB2 cells was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In vivo [(3)H]-nicotinate uptake by the retina was 5.4-fold greater than that of [(14)C]-sucrose, a BRB impermeable vascular space marker. Excess amounts of unlabeled nicotinate and salicylate significantly decreased the in vivo retinal uptake of [(3)H]-nicotinate. [(3)H]-Nicotinate was taken up by TR-iBRB2 cells via an H(+)-dependent saturable process with a Michaelis constant of ~7 mM. Na(+) had minimal effect on the uptake. The H(+)-dependent uptake was significantly inhibited by endogenous monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate, and monocarboxylic drugs such as valproate, salicylate, and ibuprofen. These characteristics are consistent with those of H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 mRNAs were expressed in TR-iBRB2 cells. The Na(+)-dependent monocarboxylate transporters SMCT1 and SMCT2 were not expressed in these cells.

We tested the hypothesis that dendritic degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampal area resulting from seizure-induced neurotoxicity is modulated by cerebral oxidative damage. Kainic acid (KA, 1 nmol/5 microl) was injected intracerebroventricularly to C57Bl/6 mice. F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) and F4-neuroprostanes (F4-NeuroPs) were used as surrogate measures of in vivo oxidative stress and biomarkers of lipid peroxidation. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was quantified by evaluating citrulline level and pyramidal neuron dendrites and spines were evaluated using rapid Golgi stains and a Neurolucida system. KA produced severe seizures in mice immediately after its administration and a significant (p<0.001) increase in F2-IsoPs, F4-NeuroPs and citrulline levels were seen 30 min following treatment.

Fibrillar β-amyloid (Aβ) stimulation has previously been demonstrated to induce the assembly and activation of the microglial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase leading to superoxide production through a tyrosine kinase-based signaling cascade. Ibuprofen treatment of microglia or monocytes with racemic or S-ibuprofen inhibited Aβ-stimulated Vav tyrosine phosphorylation, NADPH oxidase assembly, and superoxide production. Interestingly, Aβ-stimulated Vav phosphorylation was not inhibited by COX inhibitors. These findings suggest that ibuprofen acts independently of cyclooxygenase COX inhibition to disrupt signaling cascades leading to microglial NADPH oxidase (NOX2) activation, preventing oxidative damage and enhancing plaque clearance in the brain.",2012,,"Wilkinson BL, Cramer PE, Varvel NH, Reed-Geaghan E, Jiang Q, Szabo A, Herrup K, Lamb BT, Landreth GE.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.06.014,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A secondary analysis of a previously conducted study was performed. In the randomized-order, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over study 20 healthy, young participants consuming a low-fiber diet at baseline were administered a daily dose of 12 g of prebiotic fiber compared with a placebo over a period of 4 weeks with a 4-week washout between arms. In this secondary analysis, we hypothesized that the fiber supplement would reduce LBP concentration. We further hypothesized that lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity, a measure of high-density lipoprotein functional capacity, would be altered. Fiber supplementation did not significantly alter LBP concentration or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity in the overall cohort. However, in a subgroup of individuals with elevated baseline LBP concentrations, fiber supplementation significantly reduced LBP from 9.27 ± 3.52 to 7.02 ± 2.32 µg/mL (P = .003). Exploratory analyses found positive correlations between microbial genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis and conversely negative correlations with genes involved in antibiotic synthesis and LBP. Positive correlations between LBP and multiple sulfated molecules including sulfated bile acids and perfluorooctanesulfonate, and ibuprofen metabolites were also found.

Local permeation of these agents has been one of the major concerns. Here we propose an approach to predict the permeability of topically applied agents for oral cancer chemoprevention. In theory, the total flux through the oral mucosa (Jmax) can be estimated by adding the transcellular flux (JTC) and the paracellular flux (JPC). To target the Cox-2 enzyme in oral epithelial cells, it is desirable to maximize the theoretical activity index, the ratio of JTC and IC50 of a Cox-2 inhibitor (JTC/IC50-Cox-2). Among the 12 commonly used NSAIDs, celecoxib, nimesulide and ibuprofen had the highest values and may be the agents of choice to target Cox-2 in oral epithelial cells through topical application. Based on these calculations, a long-term chemopreventive experiment using celecoxib (3% or 6%) through topical application was performed in a DMBA induced hamster oral cancer model.

The present study performed a comprehensive analysis of gene/protein expression induced by a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib, compared with a non-selective COX inhibitor, ibuprofen, and placebo in a clinical model of acute inflammatory pain (the surgical extraction of impacted third molars) using microarray analysis followed by quantitative RT-PCR verification and Western blotting. Inhibition of COX-2 modulated gene expression related to inflammation and pain, the arachidonic acid pathway, apoptosis/angiogenesis, cell adhesion and signal transduction. Compared to placebo, rofecoxib treatment increased the gene expression of ANXA3 (annexin 3), SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2), SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) and IL1RN (IL1 receptor antagonist) which are associated with inhibition of phospholipase A(2) and suppression of cytokine signaling cascades, respectively. Both rofecoxib and ibuprofen treatment increased the gene expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators, IL6 and CCL2 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 2), following tissue injury compared to the placebo treatment. These results indicate a complex role for COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade in addition to the well-characterized COX-dependent pathway, as multiple pathways are also involved in rofecoxib-induced anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects at the gene expression level.

While clinical reports indicate an important role of cytokines in inflammatory pain, methodological limitations have made systematic human studies difficult. This study examined the utility of a human in vivo bioassay combining microdialysis with multiplex immunoassay techniques for measuring cytokine arrays in tissue. The first experiment measured cytokines in interstitial fluid collected from non-inflamed and experimentally inflamed skin (UVB). The effects of noxious heat on cytokine release were also assessed. The second experiment examined whether anti-hyperalgesic effects of the COX-inhibitor ibuprofen were associated with decreased tissue levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6. In the first experiment, inflammation significantly increased IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, G-CSF, and MIP-1 beta. Noxious heat but not experimental inflammation significantly increased IL-7 and IL-13. In the second experiment, an oral dose of 400 and 800 mg ibuprofen produced similar anti-hyperalgesic effects suggesting a ceiling effect. Tissue levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 were not affected after the 400mg dose but decreased significantly (44+/-32% and 38+/-13%) after the 800 mg dose. These results support the utility of explored method for tracking cytokines in human tissue and suggest that anti-hyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of ibuprofen are at least partially dissociated.

Identifying the dehydration event using < 1μg of material is an increasingly important challenge. Atomic Force Microscopy indentation mapping is implemented at controlled temperatures between 25-100°C, for nanoscale volumes of hydrated APIs exhibiting distinct dehydration behavior and anhydrous APIs as controls. For caffeine hydrate and azithromycin dihydrate, the relative mechanical modulus increases ~10-fold at dehydration temperatures. These are confirmed by conventional macroscopic measurements including Variable Temperature Powder X-ray Diffraction, Thermogravimetric Analysis, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Conversely, no such mechanical transition is observed for anhydrous ibuprofen or a proprietary anhydrous compound.

Studies showed that the regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs might reduce disease progression risk for prostate cancer patients with prostate cancer. We evaluated the effects of ectopic expression of p53 on the biological functions of ibuprofen and diclofenac.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>For this purpose, We investigated cell death decision pathways related to survival and aggressive cellular phenotypes such as extrinsic/intrinsic apoptosis decision, Protein Kinase B/ Forkhead box O (AKT/FoxO) axis, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition) in wild type and p53 + PC3 prostate cancer cells.<h4>Results and conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen (1 mM) and diclofenac (250 μM) effectively induced cell cycle arrest and led to apoptosis <i>via</i> modulating both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, diclofenac was the only drug to generate ROS intermediates. Diclofenac triggered a typical EMT process with downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail in PC3 cells, regardless of p53 expression. In conclusion, although both drugs are effective on cell death mechanism, only diclofenac caused EMT because of increased ROS generation independent of p53. On the other hand, ibuprofen could inhibit metastasis <i>via</i> upregulating E-cadherin.

Tablets made from cross-linked hydrophobically modified poly (acrylic acid) (CLHMPAA), commercially available as Pemulen™, have previously shown promising abilities to control the release of hydrophobic model substances. This study further investigates the possibility to use CLHMPAA in tablet formulations using ibuprofen as a model substance. Furthermore, surfactants were added to the dissolution medium in order to simulate the presence of bile salts in the intestine. The release of ibuprofen is strongly affected by the presence of surfactant and/or buffer in the dissolution medium, which affect both the behaviour of CLHMPAA and the swelling of the gel layer that surrounds the disintegrating tablets. Two mechanisms of tablet disintegration were observed under shear, namely conventional dissolution of a soluble tablet matrix and erosion of swollen insoluble gel particles from the tablet. The effects of surfactant in the surrounding medium can be circumvented by addition of surfactant to the tablet. With added surfactant, tablets that may be insusceptible to the differences in bile salt level between fasted or fed states have been produced, thus addressing a central problem in controlled delivery of hydrophobic drugs.

Manganism is caused by neuronal injury in both cortical and subcortical regions, particularly in the basal ganglia. The basis for the selective neurotoxicity of Mn is not yet fully understood. However, several studies suggest that oxidative damage and inflammatory processes play prominent roles in the degeneration of dopamine-containing neurons. In the present study, we assessed the effects of Mn on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, changes in high-energy phosphates and associated neuronal dysfunctions both in vitro and in vivo. Results from our in vitro study showed a significant (p<0.01) increase in biomarkers of oxidative damage, F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs), as well as the depletion of ATP in primary rat cortical neurons following exposure to Mn (500 μM) for 2h. These effects were protected when neurons were pretreated for 30 min with 100 of an antioxidant, the hydrophilic vitamin E analog, trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid), or an anti-inflammatory agent, indomethacin.

In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections. First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic. Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk. Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on S. pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy). Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication.

Since then it has been used in several conflicts like the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The use of SM in Syria 2015 indicated the still existing threat. Despite decades of research no causal antidote against SM intoxication is available, so far. A SM intoxication is accompanied by necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation. To counteract the SM-induced inflammation, glucocorticoids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds (NSAIDs) are recommended. Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the anti-inflammatory compounds dexamethasone, ibuprofen and diclofenac in vitro. For that purpose, two different cell culture models were used. Firstly, a monoculture of keratinocytes (HaCaT) and secondly, an established co-culture of keratinocytes (HaCaT) and immunocompetent cells (THP-1) to identify the role of immune cells in the process and to mimic the dermal physiology more closely. Both models were challenged with different SM concentrations (100, 200 and 300μM) and treated with different anti-inflammatory compounds one hour after the SM exposure. Analytical analysis of necrosis (ToxiLight), apoptosis (CDDE) and inflammation (IL-6 and -8 ELISAs) followed 24h thereafter. Dexamethasone provided small but consistent protective effects in the monoculture. For the reduction of apoptosis, 3μM dexamethasone was sufficient. The most effective reduction regarding interleukin (IL) production was found with 6μM dexamethasone. Protective effects were less pronounced in co-culture, which implies, that the protective effects of dexamethasone are rather generic and not due to a modulation of the immune cells. Against our expectations, ibuprofen strongly amplified apoptosis and necrosis in SM exposed cells in the monoculture as well as the co-culture. Therefore, use of ibuprofen for treatment of SM intoxication should at least be considered most critically, if not even regarded as harmful. Diclofenac significantly reduced necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation in the co-culture in a dose-dependent manner. The greatest benefit regarding cell survival and reduction of the inflammation-marker IL-6 after a SM treatment was observed after diclofenac treatment. The protective effects of diclofenac were less pronounced in the monoculture which suggests, that diclofenac can modify the response of immune cells to SM. In conclusion, the results of our experiments, showing a benefit for diclofenac after SM exposure are in line with in vivo data of other researchers. Though, our in vitro results suggest the preferred use of diclofenac over ibuprofen. The benefit of dexamethasone is still equivocal, but low concentrations seem to have some positive effects.",2018,,"Menacher G, Steinritz D, Schmidt A, Popp T, Worek F, Gudermann T, Thiermann H, Balszuweit F.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.09.003,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Treatment of SM-induced adverse health effects, such as cutaneous blistering, ulceration, and inflammation remains a challenging task. Antidotes or specific therapeutic measures are lacking. Some drugs (e.g. cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors) exhibited beneficial effects after SM poisoning in vivo. However, in vitro studies that evaluate and compare the potency of COX inhibitors are missing. In the presented study, non-specific (acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, and piroxicam), COX-2-specific (celecoxib and parecoxib) inhibitors and COX-independent drugs (paracetamol and tofacitinib) were compared regarding anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects after SM exposure in post-exposure treatment settings. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were used as a surrogate model. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) formation, a direct indicator for COX activity, was determined by ELISA. Changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels after SM exposures were assessed by quantitative determination of 27 inflammatory cytokines using a multiplex method. Cytotoxicity was determined using an XTT viability assay. The results demonstrated that SM highly increased PGE<sub>2</sub> production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, predominantly IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. In general, all COX inhibitors and paracetamol were able to reduce the PGE<sub>2</sub> formation, while tofacitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinase, had no influence on PGE<sub>2</sub> levels. In addition, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α formation were also inhibited, but sometimes independently of PGE<sub>2</sub>. The COX-2 specific celecoxib was identified as the most potent drug to reduce IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α formation after SM exposures in vitro.

The test compounds were classified either as clinically ""safe"" (amlodipine, caffeine, ibuprofen), or clinically as ""risky"" (clozapine, nimesulide, ticlopidine; i.e., associated with severe clinical toxicity outcomes). Our working hypothesis was as follows: could the use of short different amino acid sequence containing d-peptides in adduct detection confer any add-on value to that obtained with GSH? All ""risky"" agents' resulted in the formation of several GSH adducts in the incubation mixture and with at least one peptide adduct with both microsomal preparations. Amlodipine did not form any adducts with any of the trapping agents. No GSH and peptide 2 and 3 adducts were found with caffeine, but with peptide 1 one adduct with human liver microsomes was detected.

However, many women are unaware of these risks, and commonly report their use in pregnancy. We aimed to determine if umbilical cord was a reliable matrix for detecting NSAID use, determine incidence of use close to labour, and uncover associations with obstetric/neonatal outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a UHPLC-MS/MS method to simultaneously detect diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, and salicylic acid in plasma and umbilical cord lysate. Using this method, we screened 380 lysates to determine the prevalence of NSAID use. Results were compared to the clinical outcomes in pregnancy using ICD9/10 chart codes (n = 21).<h4>Results</h4>The UHPLC-MS/MS method has excellent linearity, accuracy, and precision in solvent and plasma, but lower sensitivity in umbilical cord lysate. We report a 3 % rate of NSAID ingestion within days of labour - the pharmacokinetically-determined window for active ingestion. There were no significant differences observed for maternal, obstetric, or neonatal outcomes between the NSAID positive group (n = 11) and NSAID negative group (n = 369).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Because NSAID use in third trimester is contraindicated, even a 3% usage rate is alarmingly high. Based on UHPLC-MS/MS performance of umbilical cord lysate, 3% is likely a conservative estimate.

Although HSCR has clear genetic causes, no HSCR-associated mutation is 100% penetrant, suggesting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions determine HSCR occurrence. To test the hypothesis that certain medicines might alter HSCR risk we treated zebrafish with medications commonly used during early human pregnancy and discovered that ibuprofen caused HSCR-like absence of enteric neurons in distal bowel. Using fetal CF-1 mouse gut slice cultures, we found that ibuprofen treated enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDC) had reduced migration, fewer lamellipodia and lower levels of active RAC1/CDC42. Additionally, inhibiting ROCK, a RHOA effector and known RAC1 antagonist, reversed ibuprofen effects on migrating mouse ENCDC in culture. Ibuprofen also inhibited colonization of Ret+/- mouse bowel by ENCDC in vivo and dramatically reduced bowel colonization by chick ENCDC in culture. Interestingly, ibuprofen did not affect ENCDC migration until after at least three hours of exposure. Furthermore, mice deficient in Ptgs1 (COX 1) and Ptgs2 (COX 2) had normal bowel colonization by ENCDC and normal ENCDC migration in vitro suggesting COX-independent effects. Consistent with selective and strain specific effects on ENCDC, ibuprofen did not affect migration of gut mesenchymal cells, NIH3T3, or WT C57BL/6 ENCDC, and did not affect dorsal root ganglion cell precursor migration in zebrafish. Thus, ibuprofen inhibits ENCDC migration in vitro and bowel colonization by ENCDC in vivo in zebrafish, mouse and chick, but there are cell type and strain specific responses.

Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), however, has been inconsistently associated with endometrial cancer risk.<h4>Methods</h4>22,268 female residents of western Washington State, ages 50-76, completed a baseline questionnaire in 2000-2002 and reported on their use of individual NSAIDs over the past 10years. Use was categorized as none, low (<4days/week or <4years), and high (≥4days/week and ≥4years). Over 9years of follow-up, 262 incident invasive endometrial cancers were identified. Multivariable proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Relative to non-use, high use of aspirin was inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk (HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41-1.01; P trend=0.03). Findings were stronger for regular-strength than low-dose aspirin. High use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.68-1.95), including ibuprofen (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 0.73-2.28), and naproxen (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.39-2.95) was not associated with risk. In subgroup analyses, findings for aspirin were strongest for cancers of endometrioid histology and were restricted to non-smokers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides additional evidence that use of aspirin, but not non-aspirin NSAIDs, may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, especially in estrogen-mediated cases; however additional prospective studies with high-quality measurement of NSAID use are needed.

Targeting the secretion of sEV PD-L1 has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy. However, the lack of small-molecule inhibitors poses a challenge for clinical translation. In this study, we developed a target and phenotype dual-driven high-throughput screening strategy that combined virtual screening with nanoflow-based experimental verification. We identified ibuprofen (IBP) as a novel inhibitor that effectively targeted sEV PD-L1 secretion. IBP disrupted the biogenesis and secretion of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> sEVs in tumor cells by physically interacting with a critical regulator of sEV biogenesis, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate. Notably, the mechanism of action of IBP is distinct from its commonly known targets, cyclooxygenases. Administration of IBP stimulated antitumor immunity and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma mouse models. To address potential adverse effects, we further developed an IBP gel for topical application, which demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy when combined with anti-PD-1 treatment.

Often only one concentration is available in the literature, hence a general evidence-based theory could allow prediction of how altering the concentration would produce a linear, increased, or decreased relative permeation. Here, we group topical chemicals into groups of how they permeate the skin when we increase or decrease their concentrations per unit area and discuss why we would like to predict their permeability in ranges of studied concentrations.<h4>Purpose</h4>Our research question is: How, if at all, do changes in surface chemical concentration affect percutaneous penetration/absorption in man? Specifically, as the drug concentration is relatively increased, is the rate or extent of absorption proportionally affected? And if so, how?<h4>Methods</h4>We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, the United States Food and Drug Administration, Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, and the European Food Safety Authority for approved transdermal delivery systems from January 1965 to October 2020. Search terms included combinations of the following words: topical + [absorption/penetration] + cm + [human/man].<h4>Results</h4>Of the nineteen chemicals identified, five (testosterone, hydrocortisone, benzoic acid, fluazifop-butyl and lindane) showed decreased percent absorbed with increased dose, one (2-butoxyethanol) showed decreased flux with increased concentration, and thirteen (Basic Brown 17, benzene in gasoline, benzophenone-3, benzoyl peroxide, boric acid, caffeine, climbazole, diclofenac, ethanolamines, ibuprofen, N-octylamine, 2-phenoxyethanol, 2-pyrrolidone) showed increased flux with increasing concentrations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Dermal absorption depends on the interaction between the characteristics of the substance, the vehicle, and the skin. Without experiments investigating these characteristics, we cannot accurately predict the percent absorbed or flux of a formulation without in vitro or in vivo data.

Nanosuspensions had mean sizes around 100 nm and a positive charge (zeta-potential of +40/+60 mV), this makes them suitable for ophthalmic applications. Stability tests (up to 24 months storage at 4 degrees C or at room temperature) or freeze-drying were carried out to optimize a suitable pharmaceutical preparation. In vitro dissolution tests indicated a controlled release profile of IBU from nanoparticles. In vivo efficacy was assessed on the rabbit eye after induction of an ocular trauma (paracentesis). An inhibition of the miotic response to the surgical trauma was achieved, comparable to a control aqueous eye-drop formulation, even though a lower concentration of free drug in the conjunctival sac was reached from the nanoparticle system.

A specific group of NSAIDs (indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, acemetacin, zomepirac and mefenamic acid) all at non-toxic levels, significantly increased the cytotoxicity of the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin), as well as teniposide, VP-16 and vincristine, but not the other vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vinorelbine. A substantial number of other anticancer drugs, including methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, hydroxyurea, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitoxantrone, actinomycin D, bleomycin, paclitaxel and camptothecin, were also tested, but displayed no synergy in combination with the NSAIDs. The synergistic effect was concentration dependent. The effect appears to be independent of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory ability of the NSAIDs, as (i) the synergistic combination could not be reversed by the addition of prostaglandins D2 or E2; (ii) sulindac sulphone, a metabolite of sulindac that does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, was positive in the combination assay: and (iii) many NSAIDs known to be cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, e.g. meclofenamic acid, diclofenac, naproxen, fenoprofen, phenylbutazone, flufenamic acid, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and ketoprofen, were inactive in the combination assay. The enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed in a range of drug sensitive tumour cell lines, but did not occur in P-170-overexpressing multidrug resistant cell lines. However, in the HL60/ADR and COR L23R cell lines, in which multidrug resistance is due to overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP, a significant increase in cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of the active NSAIDs. Subsequent Western blot analysis of the drug sensitive parental cell lines, DLKP and A549, revealed that they also expressed MRP and reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that mRNA for MRP was present in both cell lines. It was found that the positive NSAIDs were among the more potent inhibitors of [3H]-LTC4 transport into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles prepared from MRP-expressing cells, of doxorubicin efflux from preloaded cells and of glutathione-S-transferase activity. The NSAIDs did not enhance cellular sensitivity to radiation.

A rapid absorption of orally administered CS is observed in rats and in humans when the drug is dissolved in water. Lower and delayed absorption is observed when CS is administered in gastroresistant capsules. The absolute bio-availability is 15 and 12% for rats and humans respectively. The CS shows a tropism for cartilagineous tissues in rats and for knee tissues in humans as demonstrated by scintigraphic analysis with 99mTc-CS. Monomers, oligo and polysaccharides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of CS appear in the blood and tissues together with native CS. The effects of partially depolymerized (m.m. 3 to 15 kD) and desulfated fractions on human leukocytes were investigated. CS and its fractions inhibit the directional chemotaxis induced by zymosan-activated serum, are able to decrease the phagocytosis and the release of lysozyme induced by zymosan and to protect the plasma membrane from oxygen reactive species. In rats the oral administration of CS significantly decreases granuloma formation due to sponge implants and cell migration and lysosomal enzyme release in carrageenan pleurisy. Compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen), CS appears to be more effective on cellular events of inflammation than on edema formation. It is noteworthy that CS is devoid of dangerous effects on the stomach, platelets and kidneys. In synovial fluid of patients requiring joint aspiration, treated orally for 10 days with CS (800 mg/day) the hyaluronate concentration and the intrinsic viscosity significantly increased, while collagenolytic activity, phospholipase A2 and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) decreased.

The staining conditions were optimized to 30 min staining with 2 μM JC-1 for best J-aggregate formation.

Test organisms were imaged using an automated confocal microscope, and fluorescence intensities were automatically quantified. The effect concentrations for CCCP were lower by a factor of 30 compared with the traditional OECD 202 acute toxicity test. Mitochondrial effects were also detected at lower concentrations for all tested environmental contaminants compared to the OCED 202 test.

We grew P. australis in perlite under greenhouse conditions and treated plants with 60 μg/L of IBP. Roots and rhizomes (RR), stems and leaves (SL), and liquid samples were collected during 21 days of exposure. Results show that P. australis can take up, translocate, and degrade IBP. IBP was completely removed from the liquid medium after 21 days with a half-life of 2.1 days. IBP accumulated in RR and was partly translocated to SL. Meanwhile, four intermediates were detected in the plant tissues: hydroxy-IBP, 1,2-dihydroxy-IBP, carboxy-IBP and glucopyranosyloxy-hydroxy-IBP. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was involved in the production of the two hydroxy intermediates. We hypothesize that transformation of IBP was first catalyzed by P450, and then by glycosyltransferase, followed by further storage or metabolism in vacuoles or cell walls. No significant phytotoxicity was observed based on relative growth of plants and stress enzyme activities.

Current dissolution methodologies may not always be suitable for such compounds due to excessive fluid volume, high fluid shear rates, heterogeneity of shear rates, suboptimal fluid flow, and, ultimately, the lack of absorption ability (Gray The Science of USP 1 and 2 Dissolution: Present Challenges and Future Relevance; <i>Pharmaceutical Research</i>, 2009; Vol. 26; pp 1289-1302). Herein, a new dissolution apparatus is introduced in combination with an ultrathin, semipermeable polymer membrane that mimics human passive absorption for lipophilic compounds. The ultrathin large-area polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane (UTLAM) absorption system is designed to mimic the dissolution and passive transcellular diffusion process representing the oral absorption pathway. A simple spin-casting method was developed to fabricate the ultrathin highly uniform membranes. To minimize membrane resistance to diffusion and maximize transport across the polymer membrane, 10-40 μm PDMS membranes were successfully prepared. A new diffusion cell was designed and tested to support the UTLAM and incorporates a hydrofoil impeller for more desirable hydrodynamics and mixing, using ibuprofen as a model weak acidic drug. UTLAM permeability was sufficiently high that the aqueous boundary layer contributed to the overall permeability of the system. This diffusion cell system demonstrated that, when the aqueous diffusion layer contributes to the overall resistance to transport, the pH at which absorption is 50% of maximum (pH<sub>50%</sub>) shifts from the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> to higher values, demonstrating why weak acid drugs can exhibit high absorption at pH's significantly greater than their p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>.

We thoroughly investigate global and local molecular dynamics, thermal properties, and physical stability of the IBU+acMAL binary systems by using broadband dielectric spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry as well as test their water solubility and dissolution rate. The obtained results are extensively discussed by analyzing several factors considered to affect the physical stability of amorphous systems, including those related to the global mobility, such as plasticization/antiplasticization effects, the activation energy, fragility parameter, and the number of dynamically correlated molecules as well as specific intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonds, supporting the latter by density functional theory calculations.

Before being absorbed through epithelial cell membranes to reach the systemic circulation, drugs must first dissolve in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. <i>In vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> dissolutions are complex because of their dependency upon the drug physicochemical properties, drug product, and GI physiological properties. However, an understanding of this process is critical for the development of robust drug products. To enhance our understanding of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> dissolutions, a hierarchical mass transfer (HMT) model was developed that considers the drug properties, GI fluid properties, and fluid hydrodynamics. The key drug properties include intrinsic solubility, acid/base character, p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>, particle size, and particle polydispersity. The GI fluid properties include bulk pH, buffer species concentration, fluid shear rate, and fluid convection. To corroborate the model, <i>in vitro</i> dissolution experiments were conducted in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) 2 dissolution apparatus. A weakly acidic (ibuprofen), a weakly basic (haloperidol), and a nonionizable (felodipine) drug were used to study the effects of the acid/base character, p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>, and intrinsic solubility on dissolution. 900 mL of 5 mM bicarbonate and phosphate buffers at pH 6.5 and 37 °C was used to study the impact of the buffer species on drug dissolution. To investigate the impacts of fluid shear rate and convection, the apparatus was operated at different impeller rotational speeds. Moreover, presieved ibuprofen particles with different average diameters were used to investigate the effect of particle size on drug dissolution. <i>In vitro</i> experiments demonstrate that the dissolution rates of both the ionizable compounds used in this study were slower in bicarbonate buffer than in phosphate buffer, with the same buffer concentration, because of the lower interfacial buffer capacity, a unique behavior of bicarbonate buffer. Therefore, using surrogates (i.e., 50 mM phosphate) for bicarbonate buffer for biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> dissolution testing may overestimate the <i>in vivo</i> dissolution rate for ionizable drugs. Model simulations demonstrated that, assuming a monodisperse particle size when modeling, dissolution may overestimate the dissolution rate for polydisperse particle size distributions. The hydrodynamic parameters (maximum shear rate and fluid velocity) under <i>in vitro</i> conditions in the USP 2 apparatus under different rotational speeds are orders of magnitude higher compared to the <i>in vivo</i> situation. The inconsistencies between the <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> drug dissolution hydrodynamic conditions may cause an overestimation of the dissolution rate under <i>in vitro</i> conditions. The <i>in vitro</i> dissolution data supported the accuracy of the HMT for drug dissolution.

It is critical to understand how particle size and dose affect the behavior of dissolving particles in the presence of a CBL adjacent to a semipermeable surface both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Control of particle size is ubiquitous in the pharmaceutical industry; however, traditional pharmaceutical assumptions of particle dissolution typically ignore particle dissolution within the length scale of the CBL. The CBL does not physically prevent particles from traveling to the semipermeable surface (mucus, epithelial barrier, synthetic membrane, etc.), and particle dissolution can occur within the CBL thickness (δ<sub>C</sub>) if the particle is sufficiently small (∼<i>d</i><sub>particle</sub> ≤ δ<sub>C</sub>). The total flux (the time rate transport of molecules across the membrane surface per unit area) was chosen as a surrogate parameter for measuring the additional mass generated by particles dissolving within the donor CBL. Mass transfer experiments aimed to measure the total flux of drug using an ultrathin large-area membrane diffusion cell described by Sinko et al. with a silicone-based membrane ( <i>Mol.

Experimentally measured total flux across the semipermeable membrane/CBL region agreed with the predictions from the proposed model, and at a range of relatively low suspension concentrations, dependent on the average particle size, there was a measurable effect on the flux due to the difference in δ<sub>C</sub> that formed at the membrane surface. Additionally, the dose-dependent total flux across the membrane was up to 10% higher than the flux predicted by the standard Higuchi-Hiestand dissolution model where the effects of confinement were ignored as described by Wang et al.

The polar/electrostatic interaction forces between analytes and membrane phospholipids (Δlog kW(IAM)) were calculated as the differences between the experimental values of log kW(IAM) and those expected for isolipophilic neutral compounds having polar surface area (PSA) = 0. The values of passage through a porcine brain lipid extract (PBLE) artificial membrane for 36 out of the 42 compounds considered, measured by the so-called PAMPA-BBB technique, were taken from the literature (P0(PAMPA-BBB)). The values of blood-brain barrier (BBB) passage measured in situ, P0(in situ), for 38 out of the 42 compounds considered, taken from the literature, represented the permeability of the neutral forms on ""efflux minimized"" rodent models. The present work was aimed at verifying the soundness of Δlog kW(IAM) at describing the potential of passage through the BBB as compared to data achieved by the PAMPA-BBB technique. In a first instance, the values of log P0(PAMPA-BBB) (32 data points) were found significantly related to the n-octanol lipophilicity values of the neutral forms (log P(N)) (r(2) = 0.782) whereas no significant relationship (r(2) = 0.246) was found with lipophilicity values of the mixtures of ionized and neutral forms existing at the experimental pH 7.4 (log D(7.4)) as well as with either log kW(IAM) or Δlog kW(IAM) values. log P0(PAMPA-BBB) related moderately to log P0(in situ) values (r(2) = 0.604). The latter did not relate with either n-octanol lipophilicity indexes (log P(N) and log D(7.4)) or phospholipid affinity indexes (log kW(IAM)). In contrast, significant inverse linear relationships were observed between log P0(in situ) (38 data points) and Δlog kW(IAM) values for all the compounds but ibuprofen and chlorpromazine, which behaved as moderate outliers (r(2) = 0.656 and r(2) = 0.757 for values achieved on IAM.PC.MG and IAM.PC.DD2, respectively). Since log P0(in situ) refer to the ""intrinsic permeability"" of the analytes regardless their ionization degree, no correction for ionization of Δlog kW(IAM) values was needed. Furthermore, log P0(in situ) were found roughly linearly related to log BB values (i.e., the logarithm of the ratio brain concentration/blood concentration measured in vivo) for all the analytes but those predominantly present at the experimental pH 7.4 as anions. These results suggest that, at least for the data set considered, Δlog kW(IAM) parameters are more effective than log P0(PAMPA-BBB) at predicting log P0(in situ) values for all the analytes. Furthermore, ionization appears to affect differently, and much more markedly, BBB passage of acids (yielding anions) than that of the other ionizable compounds.",2016,,"Grumetto L, Russo G, Barbato F.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00397,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the in vivo drug dissolution and systemic absorption of the BCS class IIa drug ibuprofen under fed and fasted conditions by direct sampling of stomach and small intestinal luminal content. Expanding current knowledge of drug dissolution in vivo will help to establish physiologically relevant in vitro models predictive of drug dissolution. A multilumen GI catheter was orally inserted into the GI tract of healthy human subjects. Subjects received a single oral dose of ibuprofen (800 mg tablet) with 250 mL of water under fasting and fed conditions. The GI catheter facilitated collection of GI fluid from the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. Ibuprofen concentration in GI fluid supernatant and plasma was determined by LC-MS/MS. A total of 23 subjects completed the study, with 11 subjects returning for an additional study visit (a total of 34 completed study visits). The subjects were primarily white (61%) and male (65%) with an average age of 30 years. The subjects had a median [min, max] weight of 79 [52, 123] kg and body mass index of 25.7 [19.4, 37.7] kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Ibuprofen plasma levels were higher under fasted conditions and remained detectable for 28 h under both conditions. The AUC<sub>0-24</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were lower in fed subjects vs fasted subjects, and T<sub>max</sub> was delayed in fed subjects vs fasted subjects. Ibuprofen was detected immediately after ingestion in the stomach under fasting and fed conditions until 7 h after dosing. Higher levels of ibuprofen were detected in the small intestine soon after dosing in fasted subjects compared to fed. In contrast to plasma drug concentration, overall gastric concentrations remained higher under fed conditions due to increased gastric pH vs fasting condition. The gastric pH increased to near neutrality after feedingbefore decreasing to acidic levels after 7 h. Induction of the fed state reduced systemic levels but increased gastric levels of ibuprofen, which suggest that slow gastric emptying and transit dominate the effect for plasma drug concentration. The finding of high levels of ibuprofen in stomach and small intestine 7 h post dosing was unexpected.

PDMS is biomimetic because of similarities in small molecule transport, such as mechanism, ionization selectivity, lipophilicity. Nine molecular probes are used to evaluate the transport pathways and properties used to predict human oral absorption rates. The transport pathways through PDMS (bulk/pore) are analogous to transcellular (TCDT) and paracellular (PCDT) drug transport pathways. PDMS PCDT is assessed using positronium annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and partition experiments; TCDT using diffusion and partition experiments. PALS determined that PDMS pores were uniform (D ∼ 0.85 nm), isolated, and void volume was unaffected by drug accumulation after equilibrium partitioning. Therefore, there is no PCDT or convective flow through PDMS. A strong linear correlation exists between predicted octanol-water partition coefficients and PDMS partition coefficients (LogK<sub>PDMS</sub> = 0.736 × LogP<sub>O-W</sub> - 0.971, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.981). The pH-partition hypothesis is confirmed in PDMS using ibuprofen over pH 2-12.

Although NSAIDs are known to impact multiple cellular signaling mechanisms, a recent finding is that the NSAID salicylate can disrupt histone acetylation, in part through direct inhibition of the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300/CBP. While salicylate is a relatively weak KAT inhibitor, its CoA-linked metabolite is more potent; however, the ability of NSAID metabolites to inhibit KAT enzymes biochemically and in cells remains relatively unexplored. Here we define the role of metabolic and nonmetabolic mechanisms in inhibition of KAT activity by NSAID chemotypes. First, we screen a small panel of NSAIDs for biochemical inhibition of the prototypical KAT p300, leading to the finding that many carboxylate-containing NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, are able to function as weak inhibitors. Assessing the inhibition of p300 by ibuprofen-CoA, a known NSAID metabolite, reveals that linkage of ibuprofen to CoA increases its biochemical potency toward p300 and other KAT enzymes. In cellular studies, we find that carboxylate-containing NSAIDs inhibit histone acetylation. Finally, we exploit the stereoselective metabolism of ibuprofen to assess the role of its acyl-CoA metabolite in regulation of histone acetylation. This unique strategy reveals that formation of ibuprofen-CoA and histone acetylation are poorly correlated, suggesting metabolism may not be required for ibuprofen to inhibit histone acetylation. Overall, these studies provide new insights into the ability of NSAIDs to alter histone acetylation, and illustrate how selective metabolism may be leveraged as a tool to explore the influence of metabolic acyl-CoAs on cellular enzyme activity.",2018,,"Shrimp JH, Garlick JM, Tezil T, Sorum AW, Worth AJ, Blair IA, Verdin E, Snyder NW, Meier JL.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00943,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In a previous study, we determined the solution and total concentrations of ibuprofen as a function of time in aspirated GI fluids, after oral administration of an 800 mg IR tablet (reference standard) of ibuprofen to 20 healthy volunteers in fasted state conditions. In addition, we determined luminal pH and motility pressure recordings that were simultaneously monitored along the GI tract. Blood samples were taken to determine ibuprofen plasma levels. In this work, an in-depth statistical and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to explain which underlying GI variables are determining the systemic concentrations of ibuprofen between (inter-) and within (intra-) subjects. In addition, the obtained plasma profiles were deconvoluted to link the fraction absorbed with the fraction dissolved. Multiple linear regressions were performed to explain and quantitatively express the impact of underlying GI physiology on systemic exposure of the drug (in terms of plasma C<sub>max</sub>/AUC and plasma T<sub>max</sub>). The exploratory analysis of the correlation between plasma C<sub>max</sub>/AUC and the time to the first phase III contractions postdose (TMMC-III) explains ∼40% of the variability in plasma C<sub>max</sub> for all fasted state subjects. We have experimentally shown that the in vivo intestinal dissolution of ibuprofen is dependent upon physiological variables like, in this case, pH and postdose phase III contractions. For the first time, this work presents a thorough statistical analysis explaining how the GI behavior of an ionized drug can explain the systemic exposure of the drug based on the individual profiles of participating subjects. This creates a scientifically based and rational framework that emphasizes the importance of including pH and motility in a predictive in vivo dissolution methodology to forecast the in vivo performance of a drug product.

Many in vivo techniques are available to investigate the impact of GI physiology on oral drug behavior in fasting state conditions. However, little is known about the intraluminal behavior of a drug in postprandial conditions. In a previous report, we described the mean solution and total concentrations of ibuprofen after oral administration of an immediate-release (IR) tablet in fed state conditions. In parallel, blood samples were taken to assess systemic concentrations. The purpose of this work was to statistically evaluate the impact of GI physiology (e.g., pH, contractile events) within and between individuals (intra and intersubject variability) for a total of 17 healthy subjects. In addition, a pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed by noncompartmental analysis, and PK parameters were correlated with underlying physiological factors (pH, time to phase III contractions postdose) and study parameters (e.g., ingested amount of calories, coadministered water). Moreover, individual plasma profiles were deconvoluted to assess the fraction absorbed as a function of time, demonstrating the link between intraluminal and systemic behavior of the drug. The results demonstrated that the in vivo dissolution of ibuprofen depends on the present gastric pH and motility events at the time of administration. Both intraluminal factors were responsible for explaining 63% of plasma C<sub>max</sub> variability among all individuals. For the first time, an in-depth analysis was performed on a large data set derived from an aspiration/motility study, quantifying the impact of physiology on systemic behavior of an orally administered drug product in fed state conditions.

In this work, we developed a pore-expanded version of MIL-101(Cr), MIL-101(Cr)-P, and assessed its potential as a carrier for ibuprofen and 5-fluorouracil drugs along with its regular MIL-101(Cr) analogue. The pore expansion strategy gave rise to a higher surface area and mesopore volume for MIL-101(Cr)-P relative to regular MIL-101(Cr). The characterization results revealed successful incorporation of 30, 50, and 80 wt % of both drugs within the MOF structure. Upon incorporation of species, the surface area and porosity of the two MOF carriers decreased drastically; however, the drug-loaded MOFs still retained some degree of porosity, even at high drug loadings. For both drugs, the delivery experiments conducted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) showed that MIL-101(Cr)-P possessed better pharmacokinetic behavior than MIL-101(Cr) by delivering higher amounts of drug at all three loadings and exhibiting much faster release rates. Such behavior was originated from large mesopores that were created during pore expansion, providing diffusional pathways for efficient delivery of the drugs. The highest rate constant obtained by fitting the release kinetics to the Higuchi model was found to be 0.44 h<sup>-1/2</sup> for the release of 30 wt % 5-fluorouracil from MIL-101(Cr)-P.

However, the permeation of drug molecules across the skin is difficult due to the presence of highly ordered lipid barrier. This study details the development of a novel TD system, which has the potential to simultaneously enhance the skin permeability and adhesion behavior. Ibuprofen (IP) was selected as model drug. The ability of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) and hydrophobic titanium nanotube (TNT) to enhance the skin permeability was explored. Additionally, β-cyclodextrin (βCD), which can exceptionally encapsulate poorly water-soluble drugs, is grafted with methacrylates to improve the skin adhesion property. Finally, Au-TNT nanocomposite was deposited onto methacrylate-grafted βCD matrix. The developed material was characterized through NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The characteristics of the film, including water vapor permeability (WVP), thermomechanical properties, etc., were examined in terms of Au-TNT content. The TD delivery of IP with different concentrations of Au-TNT was evaluated via an in vitro skin permeation study through rat skin. It is revealed that the prepared TD film exhibited an improved drug-delivery performance due to the synergistic action of AuNP and hydrophobic TNT. The cumulative percent of IP delivered across the skin is extremely depending on nanofiller content, lipophilicity, and thickness of the membrane, and the device incorporated with 4.0% Au-TNT displayed the best performance. In addition, a study on storage stability was performed by storing the films for 2 months at different temperatures. The study revealed that the device possessed excellent storage stability when stored at low temperature. The developed film offers excellent WVP, drug encapsulation efficiency, thermomechanical properties, and skin adhesion behavior. Moreover, the device was cosmetically attractive, noncytotoxic, and resistant to microbial growth and hence extremely reliable for skin application.

The complete fibrous membrane sandwich can be folded and embedded into a 0-size capsule to achieve oral compliance. Simulated in vitro testing of gastric and intestinal fluids demonstrated a triphasic release profile. There was an immediate release of GLP after gastric juices dissolved the capsule shell and the PVP, followed by the short-term release of 60% of the IBU within an hour afterward, and the remaining IBU was released in a sustained manner following a Fickian diffusion profile.

It is an emergency condition and challenging to treat due to the poor vascularity of affected body parts, and it requires immediate action. In addition to cold trauma-induced tissue damage, the inflammatory mediators majorly contribute to pathologic aggravations. We have designed and evaluated a topical ""nano-spray gel (NSG)"" formulation, which is based on a combination of liposomal heparin sodium (Hp) and ibuprofen (Ibu) for rapid relief of frostbite injury in extremely low temperatures. The scientific literature suggests that heparin is associated with rapid endothelial cell repair, normalizing blood circulation in capillaries, and has a potential role in wound healing. Hp-containing liposomes were prepared by the extruder method, which suitably formulated an ibuprofen-containing gel to obtain a nano-Spray formulation (HLp-Ibu-NSG) applicable for topical delivery. A single spray puff of the formulation delivers ∼154 mg of the gel, which corresponds to ∼205 U of heparin. In this study, heparin liposomes exhibited significant healing of wound in vitro (scratch assay, fibroblast cells) and in vivo (wound healing in Sprague Dawley rats) at a low dose. In the rat model of frostbite injury, the HLp-Ibu-NSG formulation demonstrated significant reduction in the wound area (up to ∼96%) and improvement of histopathology in 14 days as compared to the control groups. No edema and erythema were detected post-treatment of HLp-Ibu-NSG in the affected area. The underlying mechanism was delineated as a modulation of the inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-4) mediators at the wound site and blood circulation to foster frostbite healing.

In the brain, however, the transporter-mediated drug delivery has not yet been fully achieved due to the complexity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Because L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a good candidate to improve the brain delivery, we developed here four novel LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. As a result, all the prodrugs were able to cross the BBB and localize into the brain cells. The brain uptake of salicylic acid (SA) was improved five times, not only across the mouse BBB but also into the cultured mouse and human brain cells. The naproxen prodrug was also transported efficiently into the mouse brain achieving less peripheral exposure, but the brain release of naproxen from the prodrug was not improved. Contrarily, the high plasma protein binding of the flurbiprofen prodrug and the premature bioconversion of the ibuprofen prodrug in the mouse blood hindered the efficient brain delivery. Thus, the structure of the parent drug affects the successful brain delivery of the LAT1-utilizing prodrugs, and the small-sized LAT1-utilizing prodrug of SA constituted a successful model to specifically deliver its parent drug across the mouse BBB and into the cultured mouse and human brain cells.",2020,,"Montaser AB, Järvinen J, Löffler S, Huttunen J, Auriola S, Lehtonen M, Jalkanen A, Huttunen KM.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00564,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To address this challenge, a bimetallic (copper and zinc) plantain-based adsorbent (CZPP) and reduced graphene oxide modified form (CZPPrgo) was prepared by facile synthesis for the removal of ibuprofen (IBP) and diclofenac (DCF) in water. Both the CZPP and CZPPrgo were characterized by different techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and pH<sub>pzc</sub> analysis. FTIR and XRD confirmed the successful synthesis of the CZPP and CZPPrgo. The adsorption of the contaminants was carried out in a batch system, and several operational variables were optimized. The adsorption is affected by the initial concentration of the pollutants (5-30 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>), the adsorbent dose (0.05-0.20 g), and pH (2.0-12.0). The CZPPrgo has the best performance with maximum adsorption capacities of 148 and 146 mg·g<sup>-1</sup> for removing IBP and DCF from water, respectively. The experimental data were fitted into different kinetic and isotherm models; the removal of IBP and DCF follows the pseudo-second order, which can be best explained by the Freundlich isotherm model. The reuse efficiency was above 80% even after four adsorption cycles. This shows that the CZPPrgo is a promising adsorbent for removing IBP and DCF in water.",2023,,"Bayode AA, Folorunso MT, Helmreich B, Omorogie MO.",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c07769,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Deep-learning-based drug repurposing can contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic applications for drugs with other indications. The current study used a trained deep-learning model to screen an FDA-approved drug library for novel COX-2 inhibitors. Reference COX-2 data sets, composed of active and decoy compounds, were obtained from the DUD-E database. To extract molecular features, compounds were subjected to RDKit, a cheminformatic toolkit. GraphConvMol, a graph convolutional network model from DeepChem, was applied to obtain a predictive model from the DUD-E data sets. Then, the COX-2 inhibitory potential of the FDA-approved drugs was predicted using the trained deep-learning model. Vismodegib, an anticancer agent that inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway by binding to smoothened, was predicted to inhibit COX-2. Noticeably, some compounds that exhibit high potential from the prediction were known to be COX-2 inhibitors, indicating the prediction model's liability. To confirm the COX-2 inhibition activity of vismodegib, molecular docking was carried out with the reference compounds of the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and ibuprofen. Furthermore, the experimental examination of COX-2 inhibition was also carried out using a cell culture study. Results showed that vismodegib exhibited a highly comparable COX-2 inhibitory activity compared to celecoxib and ibuprofen. In conclusion, the deep-learning model can efficiently improve the virtual screening of drugs, and vismodegib can be used as a novel COX-2 inhibitor.",2023,,"Yasir M, Park J, Han ET, Park WS, Han JH, Kwon YS, Lee HJ, Chun W.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c05425,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Because of its source, it is characterized by a high carbon content, and so it has been considered a worthwhile substrate for the synthesis of carbon dots (CDs). Therefore, waste biomass with high availability in Central Europe was selected as substrates for CDs synthesis: apple pomace, rapeseed pomace, and potato peelings. These materials are characterized by varying the composition and nitrogen content. The synthesis of CDs by thermolysis was investigated. The obtained CDs were examined by UV-vis spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The CDs synthesis yield (SY) and fluorescence quantum yield (QY) were determined. This paper proves that CDs can be synthesized efficiently by thermal degradation in a solvent-free process using plant waste biomass. Despite the varying compositions of the substrates, CDs with similar emission characteristics were achieved. CDs obtained from apple pomace and potato peelings have a crystalline structure and size of 4-5 nm, while CDs obtained from rapeseed pomace have an amorphous structure and size of 11 nm. CDs derived at 260 °C from potato peelings are characterized by the strongest fluorescence among synthesized materials, a QY of 14.5%, with 12.3% SY. The potential of the obtained CDs as an optical biosensor was investigated against a variety of metal ions and water pollutants. The CDs obtained from potato peelings can be effectively used in the detection of Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions (linearity range 12.5-1250 μM) and ibuprofen (linearity range 0.25-5 mM).",2025,,"Matyjasik W, Matus K, Długosz O, Pulit-Prociak J, Banach M.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c10119,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In particular, pharmaceuticals have caused great concern because after their consumption, traces of metabolites are excreted and reach the water resources either directly or after inefficient treatment. Despite this, these compounds are not regulated in drinking water, and existing toxicity data are inadequate to assess potential risks from chronic low-dose exposure. Considering the necessity to find new efficient, reusable, and biocompatible systems to remove organic pollutants from wastewater, the adsorption process has been found to be the most effective and economical because it is simple, highly efficient, regenerative, and scalable and does not produce intermediates that can increase the toxicity of the parent contaminants. Prompted by these reasons, in this research, an adsorbed medium composed of graphene oxide and an amine-oxazoline-based polymer (poly-(2-(3-(amino)-propyl))-2-oxazoline) was synthesized and employed in several adsorption experiments targeting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (<b>1</b>), aspirin (<b>2</b>), ketoprofen (<b>3</b>), and benzoic acid (<b>4</b>). The specific interaction between acidic moieties of drugs and basic domains of the polymer has been investigated by targeting both acid compounds and pharmaceutical products free of carboxylic groups. Also, the influence of several parameters, including initial concentration, liquid-phase composition, pH, and reusability, has been investigated. Results show that the maximum adsorption capacity for ibuprofen (<b>1</b>), aspirin (<b>2</b>), ketoprofen (<b>3</b>), and benzoic acid (<b>4</b>) for experiments conducted in water, at the maximum initial concentration explored (90 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and at natural pH equilibrium (pH ∼ 4), are, respectively, 37.4, 27.5, 43.5, and 26.0 mg g<sup>-1</sup>. These findings suggest that the prepared GO-pAmOx material has significant potential for adsorbing these drugs in water and good versatility for all investigated acid compounds and maintains high reusability. Notably, the reduction in adsorption capacity after ten adsorption cycles was only 1%.",2025,,"Stefanuto L, Ricci A, Fardelli E, Del Galdo S, Pepi S, Graziani V, Tortora L, Rossi C, Arena V, Bongiorno C, Smecca E, Capellini G, Capone B, Tofani D, Gasperi T.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.5c00043,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite the recent reports, integrated information related to the measurements and effects of NSAIDs on Brazilian water ecosystems is still limited, given the importance of Brazilian aquatic biodiversity. Thus, to fill these gaps, after a close literature search using scientific databases, this review aims to summarize the main scientific efforts concerning the occurrence of NSAIDs in Brazilian aquatic environments, the multiple physiological effects on native species, and the different protocols used in the research laboratories. Accordingly to the current literature data (2013-2023), a total of 32 studies were found describing the occurrence of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen in Brazilian waters, with concentration ranging from 2.5 to 785,280 ng L<sup>-1</sup>, with the majority of the studies performed in Sao Paulo state (<i>n</i> = 10) showing the heterogeneity of monitoring across Brazilian territory. Regarding the adverse effects on native aquatic species, a total of 3 species, including <i>Rhamdia quelen</i>, <i>Astyanax lacustris</i>, and <i>Hoplias malabaricus</i>, have been used to investigate the NSAIDs' adverse effects. The investigations reported endocrine disruption effects by diclofenac and ibuprofen, isolated and combined, in teleosts, oxidative stress responses, and immunotoxicity effects after NSAIDs exposure. When considering the ecotoxicological risk assessment of NSAIDs to Brazilian water bodies, the data showed a low risk quotient (RQ) for the native models across Brazilian territory. However, due to the lack of investigations using representative biological models and robust data concerning the adverse biological impacts of NSAIDs, the RQ may be underestimated, and future directions on NSAIDs investigations are suggested using an integrative approach between environmental safety standards and human health at different environmental risk evaluations.",2025,,"Godoi FGA, Dias MA, Montagner CC, Lo Nostro FL, Moreira RG.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.5c01916,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To construct the solid-phase extraction (SPE) tip, only 5 mg of MOF was immobilized within a 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter, enabling rapid and solvent-efficient sample pretreatment. Coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), the method achieved a detection limit of 0.038 μg/L and a recovery rate of 96.84% at pH 3. The extraction performance was strongly influenced by solution pH, with ζ-potential analysis revealing electrostatic attraction as the primary mechanism for naproxen adsorption under acidic conditions.

(-)-Oleocanthal is a monophenolic secoiridoid exclusively occurring in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). While several groups have investigated oleocanthal pharmacokinetics (PK) and disposition, none was able to detect oleocanthal in biological fluids or identify its PK profile that is essential for translational research studies. Besides, oleocanthal could not be detected following its addition to any fluid containing amino acids or proteins such as plasma or culture media, which could be attributed to its unique structure with two highly reactive aldehyde groups. Here, we demonstrate that oleocanthal spontaneously reacts with amino acids, with high preferential reactivity to glycine compared to other amino acids or proteins, affording two products: an unusual glycine derivative with a tetrahydropyridinium skeleton that is named oleoglycine, and our collective data supported the plausible formation of tyrosol acetate as the second product. Extensive studies were performed to validate and confirm oleocanthal reactivity, which were followed by PK disposition studies in mice, as well as cell culture transport studies to determine the ability of the formed derivatives to cross physiological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier. To the best of our knowledge, we are showing for the first time that (-)-oleocanthal is biochemically transformed to novel products in amino acids/glycine-containing fluids, which were successfully monitored <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, creating a completely new perspective to understand the well-documented bioactivities of oleocanthal in humans.",2021,,"Darakjian LI, Rigakou A, Brannen A, Qusa MH, Tasiakou N, Diamantakos P, Reed MN, Panizzi P, Boersma MD, Melliou E, El Sayed KA, Magiatis P, Kaddoumi A.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00166,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The enzymes are remarkable in that they catalyze two dioxygenations and two cyclizations of the native substrate, arachidonic acid, with near absolute regio- and stereoselectivity. Several theories have been advanced to explain the nature of enzymatic control over this series of reactions, including suggestions of steric shielding and oxygen channeling. As proposed here, selective radical trapping and spin localization in the substrate-derived pentadienyl radical intermediate can also be envisioned. Herein we describe the results of explicit, 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations of both COX-1 and COX-2 with the substrate-derived pentadienyl radical intermediate bound in the active site. The enzymes' influence on the conformation of the pentadienyl radical was investigated, along with the accessible space above and below the radical plane and the width of several channels to the active site that could function as access routes for molecular oxygen. Additional simulations demonstrated the extent of molecular oxygen mobility within the active site. The results suggest that spin localization is unlikely to play a role in enzymatic control of this reaction. Instead, a combination of oxygen channeling, steric shielding, and selective radical trapping appears to be responsible.

Neither of these conditions reflects a normal exposure of an individual when re-entering an area after pesticide application, that is, contact with dried residue of the diluted product on foliage. Methodology has therefore been developed to determine a relevant estimate of this potential dermal re-entry exposure from pesticide residues. Potential delivery platforms have been characterized for the transfer of pesticide residue to skin. Spin coating has been used to deposit uniform pesticide layers on to each platform. Five pesticides have been chosen to encompass a wide range of physicochemical properties: atrazine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), chlorpyrifos, monocrotophos, and acetochlor. In vitro (Franz diffusion cell) experiments have been performed to monitor the transfer of these pesticides from the delivery platforms onto and through excised porcine skin. Parallel experiments were also conducted with aqueous pesticide dilutions for comparison, and a final in vivo measurement using ibuprofen (as a model compound) complemented the in vitro data. The results demonstrate that transfer of chemical residue onto and subsequently through the skin is dependent on the physical attributes of the residue formed.

Optimization of the Lewis-acidic metal ion, chelate, amino acid linker, and biological targeting vector provides means to release peptide-based (radio-)metallopharmaceuticals in solution and from the solid phase using metal-mediated, autolytic amide bond cleavage (MMAAC).

We also compare the antiaggregation propensity of naproxen with that of ibuprofen. Naproxen's antiaggregation effect is influenced by two factors. Similar to ibuprofen, naproxen destabilizes binding of incoming Aβ peptides to the fibril due to direct competition between the ligands and the peptides for the same binding location on the fibril surface (the edge). However, in contrast to ibuprofen, naproxen binding also alters the conformational ensemble of Aβ monomers by promoting β-structure. The second factor weakens naproxen's antiaggregation effect.

The three prodrugs exhibit in vivo anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities with improved potency over each parent drug when compared to a nonhydrolyzable control betahistine-propyphenazone (BET-MP). Additionally, ANT-MP formed by the irreversible coupling of propyphenazone and 4-aminoantipyrine, displayed exceptional COXII selectivity (COXII IC50 of 0.97 ± 0.04 μM, compared to no observed inhibition of COXI at 160 μM). Inhibition of COXII suppresses inflammatory diseases without affecting COXI-mediated GI tract events. ANT-MP exhibited maximal analgesic effect when tested in vivo in an abdominal writhing assay (100% protection) and its anti-inflammatory activity showed a peak at 2 h in a carrageenan-induced paw edema model. Its unique selectivity toward the COXII enzyme was investigated using molecular modeling techniques.",2014,,"Radwan MF, Dalby KN, Kaoud TS.",https://doi.org/10.1021/ml500156v,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A hallmark of postpartum biology that may contribute to this poor prognosis is mammary gland involution, involving massive epithelial cell death and dramatic stromal remodeling. Previous studies show pro-tumorigenic properties of extracellular matrix (ECM) isolated from rodent mammary glands undergoing postpartum involution. More recent work demonstrates systemic ibuprofen treatment during involution decreases its tumor-promotional nature. Utilizing a proteomics approach, we identified relative differences in the composition of mammary ECM isolated from nulliparous rats and those undergoing postpartum involution, with and without ibuprofen treatment. GeLC-MS/MS experiments resulted in 20327 peptide identifications that mapped to 884 proteins with a <0.02% false discovery rate. Label-free quantification yielded several ECM differences between nulliparous and involuting glands related to collagen-fiber organization, cell motility and attachment, and cytokine regulation. Increases in known pro-tumorigenic ECM proteins osteopontin, tenascin-C, and laminin-α1 and pro-inflammatory proteins STAT3 and CD68 further identify candidate mediators of breast cancer progression specific to the involution window. With postpartum ibuprofen treatment, decreases in tenascin-C and three laminin chains were revealed.

However, its clinical use is hampered by a limited brain distribution. The aim of this study was to design and synthesize brain-targeting dexibuprofen prodrugs and to evaluate their brain-targeting efficiency using biodistribution and pharmacokinetic analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>In vitro stability, biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats. The concentrations of dexibuprofen in biosamples, including the plasma, brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, were measured using high pressure lipid chromatography (HPLC). The pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug in the plasma and tissues were calculated using obtained data and statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Five dexibuprofen prodrugs that were modified to contain ethanolamine-related structures were designed and synthesized. Their chemical structures were confirmed using (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, and HRMS. In the biodistribution study, 10 min after intravenous administration of dexibuprofen (11.70 mg/kg) and its prodrugs (the dose of each compound was equivalent to 11.70 mg/kg of dexibuprofen) in male Sprague-Dawley rats, the dexibuprofen concentrations in the brain and plasma were measured. The C(brain)/C(plasma) ratios of prodrugs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 17.0-, 15.7-, 7.88-, 9.31-, and 3.42-fold higher than that of dexibuprofen, respectively (P<0.01). Thus, each of the prodrugs exhibited a significantly enhanced brain distribution when compared with dexibuprofen. In the pharmacokinetic study, prodrug 1 exhibited a brain-targeting index of 11.19 {DTI=(AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma))(1)/(AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma))(dexibuprofen)}.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ethanolamine-related structures may play an important role in transport across the brain blood barrier.",2012,,"Zhang X, Liu X, Gong T, Sun X, Zhang ZR.",https://doi.org/10.1038/aps.2011.144,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is the predominant Ca(2+) entry mechanism in most cancer cells, and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) sensor for store-operated channels. Here we reported that the STIM1 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. STIM1 overexpression in CRC was significantly associated with tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis status and serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen. Furthermore, ectopic expression of STIM1 promoted CRC cell motility, while depletion of STIM1 with short hairpin RNA inhibited CRC cell migration. Our data further suggested that STIM1 promoted CRC cell migration through increasing the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Importantly, ectopically expressed COX-2 or exogenous PGE2 were able to rescue migration defect in STIM1 knockdown CRC cells, and inhibition of COX-2 with ibuprofen and indomethacin abrogated STIM1-mediated CRC cell motility. In short, our data provided clinicopathological significance for STIM1 and SOCE in CRC progression, and implicated a role for COX-2 in STIM1-mediated CRC metastasis.

Contemporary pharmacological treatment is effective in only 70-80% of the cases. Moreover, indomethacin or ibuprofen, which are used to close a PDA may be accompanied by serious side effects in premature infants. To explore the novel molecular pathways, which may be involved in the maturation and closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA), we used fetal and neonatal sheep to test the hypothesis that maturational development of DA is associated with significant alterations in specific mRNA expression.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted oligonucleotide microarray experiments on the isolated mRNA from DA and ascending aorta from three study groups (premature fetus-97 ± 0 d, near-term fetus-136 ± 0.8 d, and newborn lamb-12 ± 0 h).

Here, we find that macrophage-derived itaconate promotes HCC by epigenetic induction of Eomesodermin (EOMES)-mediated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion. Our results show that the knockout of immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1), responsible for itaconate production, suppresses HCC progression. Irg1 knockout leads to a decreased proportion of PD-1<sup>+</sup> and TIM-3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Deletion or adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells shows that IRG1-promoted tumorigenesis depends on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion. Mechanistically, itaconate upregulates PD-1 and TIM-3 expression levels by promoting succinate-dependent H3K4me3 of the Eomes promoter. Finally, ibuprofen is found to inhibit HCC progression by targeting IRG1/itaconate-dependent tumor immunoevasion, and high IRG1 expression in macrophages predicts poor prognosis in HCC patients. Taken together, our results uncover an epigenetic link between itaconate and HCC and suggest that targeting IRG1 or itaconate might be a promising strategy for HCC treatment.",2023,,"Gu X, Wei H, Suo C, Shen S, Zhu C, Chen L, Yan K, Li Z, Bian Z, Zhang P, Yuan M, Yu Y, Du J, Zhang H, Sun L, Gao P.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43988-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although genomic instability has been extensively studied in cell culture and cancer paradigms, little is known about its effect during embryonic development, a period of rapid cellular proliferation. Here we report that mutations in the heterohexameric minichromosome maintenance complex-the DNA replicative helicase comprising MCM2 to MCM7<sup>3,4</sup>-that cause genomic instability render female mouse embryos markedly more susceptible than males to embryonic lethality. This bias was not attributable to X chromosome-inactivation defects, differential replication licensing or X versus Y chromosome size, but rather to 'maleness'-XX embryos could be rescued by transgene-mediated sex reversal or testosterone administration. The ability of exogenous or endogenous testosterone to protect embryos was related to its anti-inflammatory properties<sup>5</sup>. Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, rescued female embryos that contained mutations in not only the Mcm genes but also the Fancm gene; similar to MCM mutants, Fancm mutant embryos have increased levels of genomic instability (measured as the number of cells with micronuclei) from compromised replication fork repair<sup>6</sup>. In addition, deficiency in the anti-inflammatory IL10 receptor was synthetically lethal with the Mcm4<sup>Chaos3</sup> helicase mutant.

We investigated the hypothesis that celecoxib activates AMP kinase (AMPK) signalling to enhance vascular endothelial protection. In human arterial and venous endothelial cells (EC), and in contrast to ibuprofen and naproxen, celecoxib induced the protective protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Celecoxib derivative 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC) which lacks COX-2 inhibition also upregulated HO-1, implicating a COX-2-independent mechanism. Celecoxib activated AMPKα<sup>(Thr172)</sup> and CREB-1<sup>(Ser133)</sup> phosphorylation leading to Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Importantly, these responses were not reproduced by ibuprofen or naproxen, while AMPKα silencing abrogated celecoxib-mediated CREB and Nrf2 activation. Moreover, celecoxib induced H-ferritin via the same pathway, and increased HO-1 and H-ferritin in the aortic endothelium of mice fed celecoxib (1000 ppm) or control chow. Functionally, celecoxib inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB p65<sup>(Ser536)</sup> phosphorylation by activating AMPK. This attenuated VCAM-1 upregulation via induction of HO-1, a response reproduced by DMC but not ibuprofen or naproxen. Similarly, celecoxib prevented IL-1β-mediated induction of IL-6.

The main objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of limonene (LIM) based THEDES as new possible systems for cancer treatment. LIM is known to have antitumor activity, however it is highly toxic and cell viability is often compromised, thus this compound is not selective towards cancer cells. Different THEDES based on LIM were developed to unravel the anticancer potential of such systems. THEDES were prepared by gently mixing saturated fatty acids menthol or ibuprofen (IBU) with LIM. Successful THEDES were obtained for Menthol:LIM (1:1), CA:LIM (1:1), IBU:LIM (1:4) and IBU:LIM(1:8). The results indicate that all the THEDES present antiproliferative properties, but IBU:LIM (1:4) was the only formulation able to inhibit HT29 proliferation without comprising cell viability. Therefore, IBU:LIM (1:4) was the formulation selected for further assessment of anticancer properties. The results suggest that the mechanism of action of LIM:IBU (1:4) is different from isolated IBU and LIM, which suggest the synergetic effect of DES.

In this work, we propose to infuse a competitor drug into the extracorporeal circuit that increases the free fraction of a toxic drug and thereby increases its dialytic removal. We used a mechanistic model to assess the removal of phenytoin and carbamazepine during HD with or without binding-competition. We simulated dialytic removal of (1) phenytoin, initial concentration 70 mg/L, using 2000 mg aspirin, (2) carbamazepine, initial concentration 35 mg/L, using 800 mg ibuprofen, in a 70 kg patient. The competitor drug was infused at constant rate. For phenytoin (~ 13% free at t = 0), HD brings the patient to therapeutic concentration in 460 min while aspirin infusion reduces that time to 330 min. For carbamazepine (~ 27% free at t = 0), the ibuprofen infusion reduces the HD time to reach therapeutic concentration from 265 to 220 min. Competitor drugs with longer half-life further reduce the HD time. Binding-competition during HD is a potential treatment for drug toxicities for which current recommendations exclude HD due to strong drug-protein binding.

We report a patient with a loss-of-function of the secreted matricellular protein SMOC2 (SPARC related modular calcium binding 2) presenting severe oligodontia, microdontia, tooth root deficiencies, alveolar bone hypoplasia, and a range of skeletal malformations. Turning to a mouse model, Smoc2-GFP reporter expression indicates SMOC2 dynamically marks a range of dental and bone progenitors. While germline Smoc2 homozygous mutants are viable, tooth number anomalies, reduced tooth size, altered enamel prism patterning, and spontaneous age-induced periodontal bone and root loss are observed in this mouse model. Whole-genome RNA-sequencing analysis of embryonic day (E) 14.5 cap stage molars revealed reductions in early expressed enamel matrix components (Odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein) and dentin dysplasia targets (Dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1). We tested if like other matricellular proteins SMOC2 was required for regenerative repair. We found that the Smoc2-GFP reporter was reactivated in adjacent periodontal tissues 4 days after tooth avulsion injury. Following maxillary tooth injury, Smoc2<sup>-/-</sup> mutants had increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption surrounding the extracted molar. Interestingly, a 10-day treatment with the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitor ibuprofen (30 mg/kg body weight) blocked tooth injury-induced bone loss in Smoc2<sup>-/-</sup> mutants, reducing matrix metalloprotease (Mmp)9.

However, ozonation catalysts with combined merits of high activity, good reusability and low cost for practical industrial applications are still rare. This study aims to develop an efficient, stable and economic ozonation catalyst for the degradation of Ibuprofen, a pharmaceutical compound frequently detected as a refractory pollutant in treated wastewaters. The novel three-dimensional network-structured catalyst, comprising of δ-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets grown on woven carbon microfibers (MnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets/carbon microfiber), was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach. Catalytic ozonation performance of Ibuprofen removal in water using the new catalyst proves a significant enhancement, where Ibuprofen removal efficiency of close to 90% was achieved with a catalyst loading of 1% (w/v). In contrast, conventional ozonation was only able to achieve 65% removal efficiency under the same operating condition. The enhanced performance with the new catalyst could be attributed to its significantly increased available surface active sites and improved mass transfer of reaction media, as a result of the special surface and structure properties of this new three-dimensional network-structured catalyst. Moreover, the new catalyst displays excellent stability and reusability for ibuprofen degradation over successive reaction cycles. The facile synthesis method and low-cost materials render the new catalyst high potential for industrial scaling up. With the combined advantages of high efficiency, high stability, and low cost, this study sheds new light for industrial applications of ozonation catalysts.",2021,,"Ponnusamy G, Farzaneh H, Tong Y, Lawler J, Liu Z, Saththasivam J.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85651-2.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Cromolyn, in a new redesigned dry powder formulation, is being tested in a pivotal clinical trial in combination with low dose ibuprofen to treat early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects. To better understand the mechanistic effect cromolyn has in slowing down or halting the neuroinflammatory response associated with AD progression, we tested the effect of cromolyn to dampen the inflammatory response in the human HMC3 microglia cell line. The direct effect of cromolyn on HMC3 microglia is on cytokines and chemokines production following their activation by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Cromolyn and a new fluorinated analog dramatically reduced the secretion of a wide spectrum of inflammatory mediators, which included cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-γ, and chemokines such as CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are known to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, but how NSAIDs affect oxylipins, in addition to COX products, in animal tissues is not well understood. Oxylipins in livers from male and female mice treated with 100 mg/kg/day of ibuprofen for 7 days were investigated. The results showed that ibuprofen treated male livers contained 7 times more altered oxylipins than ibuprofen treated female livers. In male and female livers some prostaglandins were altered, while diols, hydroxy fatty acids and epoxides were significantly altered in male livers. Some soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) products, such as 9,10-DiHODE were found to be decreased, while sEH substrates (such as 9(10)-EpODE and 5(6)-EpETrE) were found to be increased in male livers treated with ibuprofen, but not in ibuprofen treated female livers. The enzymatic activities of sEH and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) were elevated by ibuprofen in both males and females. Analyzing the influence of sex on the effect of ibuprofen on oxylipins and COX products showed that approximately 27% of oxylipins detected were influenced by sex. The results reveal that ibuprofen disturbs not only the COX pathway, but also the CYP450 and lipoxygenase pathways in male mice, suggesting that ibuprofen is likely to generate sex related differences in biologically active oxylipins. Increased sEH activity after ibuprofen treatment is likely to be one of the mechanisms by which the liver reduces the higher levels of EpODEs and EpETrEs.",2021,,"Tiwari S, Yang J, Morisseau C, Durbin-Johnson B, Hammock BD, Gomes AV.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86284-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The prepared photocatalysts (PCs) are employed under simulated sunlight (SL) for the degradation of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, ibuprofen pharmaceuticals, methylene blue dye, and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) pesticide. The prepared photocatalysts are characterized in detail using several compositional, optical, and morphological techniques. The influence of the CuS (QDs) wt. % on morphological, structural, as well as photocatalytic degradation efficiency have been investigated. The small displacement between the (107) plane of CuS and the (102) plane of ZnO can confirmed the existence of lattice interaction, implying the formation of p-n heterojunctions. TEM and XRD results demonstrated that the CuS QDs are established and uniformly decorated on the surface of ZnO NRs, confirming the forming of an efficient CuS QDs @ ZnO heterojunction nanostructures. The CuS QDs @ ZnO hybrid nanocomposites showed enhancement in crystallinity, light absorption, surface area, separation of e-h pair and inhibition in their recombination at an interfacial heterojunction. In addition it is found that, 3 wt% CuS QDs @ ZnO has the foremost influence. The results showed improvement of photocatalytic activity of the 3% CuS QDs @ ZnO hybrid nanocomposite as compared to the bare ZnO nanorods. The impressive photocatalytic performance of CuS @ ZnO heterostructure nanorods may be attributed to efficient charge transfer. The prepared CuS QDs @ ZnO hybrid nanocomposites exhibited 100% removal for MB dye, after 45 min, and after 60 min for ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin pharmaceuticals, and 2.4.5 trichloro phenoxy acetic acid pesticide with the catalyst amount of 0.2 g/L.

ECa 233, a standardized Centella asiatica extract, is highly anti-inflammatory and safe. We investigated its therapeutic effects by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into right temporomandibular joint of mice and administering either ibuprofen or ECa 233 (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) for 28 days. Inflammatory and nociceptive markers, bone density, and pain hypersensitivity were examined. CFA decreased ipsilateral bone density, suggesting inflammation localization, which ipsilaterally caused immediate calcitonin gene-related peptide elevation in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (TNC), followed by late increase of NaV1.7 in TG and of p-CREB and activation of microglia in TNC. Contralaterally, only p-CREB and activated microglia in TNC showed delayed increase. Pain hypersensitivity, which developed early ipsilaterally, but late contralaterally, was reduced by ibuprofen and ECa 233 (30 or 100 mg/kg). However, ibuprofen and only 100-mg/kg ECa 233 effectively mitigated marker elevation. This suggests 30-mg/kg ECa 233 was antinociceptive, whereas 100-mg/kg ECa 233 was both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive.

The electronic, optical, and interaction properties are investigated using density functional theory calculations. The Clar's Goblet membranes (CGMs) that were chosen are semiconductors with an energy gap of around 1.5 eV, according to energy gap calculations and density of states. Molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis shows that CGMs have electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, suggesting their suitability for interacting with pharmaceutical pollutants. The adsorption energies confirm the chemical adsorption of pharmaceutical pollutants with diclofenac showing the strongest adsorption. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of CGMs-drug complexes are analyzed, revealing a redshift compared to the absorption spectrum of CGMs alone, confirming the adsorption of these drugs. Further analysis using hole/electron examinations indicates that the type of excitation is local excitation rather than charge transfer excitation. This study quantitatively characterized hole and electron distribution in excited states using various indices. The analysis revealed local excitation transitions and significant charge transfer between the CGMs molecule and pharmaceutical pollutants. Additionally, non-covalent interaction analysis indicates the presence of van der Waals interactions, highlighting the adsorption behavior of the drugs.

This study introduces a highly sensitive and sustainable ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneously determining carbamazepine, caffeine, and ibuprofen in water and wastewater. This method exhibits impressive advantages: exceptional sensitivity, high selectivity, and an economical sample preparation strategy resulting from the absence of an evaporation step after solid-phase extraction (SPE), as well as a short analysis time (10 min). Following the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guidelines Q2(R2), the developed and validated method proved to be specific, linear (correlation coefficients ≥ 0.999), precise (RSD < 5.0%), and accurate (recovery rates ranging from 77 to 160%).

However, they can favour genital malformations in newborn boys and reproductive disorders in adults. Conversely, the consequences on postnatal ovarian development and female reproductive health after in utero exposure are unknown. Here, we found that in mice, in utero exposure to therapeutic doses of the APAP-ibuprofen combination during sex determination led to delayed meiosis entry and progression in female F1 embryonic germ cells. Consequently, follicular activation was reduced in postnatal ovaries through the AKT/FOXO3 pathway, leading in F2 animals to subfertility, accelerated ovarian aging with abnormal corpus luteum persistence, due to decreased apoptosis and increased AKT-mediated luteal cell survival. Our study suggests that administration of these drugs during the critical period of sex determination could lead in humans to adverse effects that might be passed to the offspring.",2019,,"Rossitto M, Ollivier M, Déjardin S, Pruvost A, Brun C, Marchive C, Nguyen AL, Ghettas A, Keime C, de Massy B, Poulat F, Philibert P, Boizet-Bonhoure B.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0552-x.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study, we demonstrate that expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is upregulated in normal cells surrounding RasV12-transformed cells. Addition of COX inhibitor or COX-2-knockout promotes apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. Furthermore, production of Prostaglandin (PG) E<sub>2</sub>, a downstream prostanoid of COX-2, is elevated in normal cells surrounding RasV12 cells, and addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> suppresses apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. In a cell competition mouse model, expression of COX-2 is elevated in pancreatic epithelia harbouring RasV12-exressing cells, and the COX inhibitor ibuprofen promotes apical extrusion of RasV12 cells.

However, the low oral bioavailability (below 1%) of berberine due to its poor solubility and membrane permeability limits its clinical use. In this paper, we have prepared a 1:1 co-crystal berberine-ibuprofen (BJ) using drug salt metathesis and co-crystal technology. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate a 3-fold increase in vivo bioavailability of BJ compared to that of BBR, and BJ is more effective in treating obesity and its related metabolism in vitro and in vivo. We also find that BJ promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by inhibiting TBK1 and inducing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, and BJ increases adipocyte sensitivity to catecholamine by inhibiting IKKε.

In addition to antibiotics, pharmaceutical plants also produce non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, both the active ingredients and other components of the formulations. The effect of these on the surrounding microbial communities is less clear. We aimed to assess whether non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals and other compounds produced by pharmaceutical plants have inherent toxicity, and whether long-term exposure might result in significant genetic changes or select for cross-resistance to antibiotics. To this end, we screened four non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, propranolol, metformin) and titanium dioxide for toxicity against Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and conducted a 30 day selection experiment to assess the effect of long-term exposure. All compounds reduced the maximum optical density reached by E. coli at a range of concentrations including one of environmental relevance, with transcriptome analysis identifying upregulated genes related to stress response and multidrug efflux in response ibuprofen treatment. The compounds did not select for significant genetic changes following a 30 day exposure, and no evidence of selection for cross-resistance to antibiotics was observed for population evolved in the presence of ibuprofen in spite of the differential gene expression after exposure to this compound.

Ibuprofen enantiomers and their respective coenzyme A thioesters were tested in human platelets and blood monocytes to determine their selectivity and potency as inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 (PGHS-1) and PGHS-2. 2. Human blood from volunteers was drawn and allowed to clot at 37 degrees C for 1 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of the test compounds (R-ibuprofen, S-ibuprofen, R-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, S-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, NS-398). Immunoreactive (ir) thromboxane B2 (TXB2) concentrations in serum were determined by a specific EIA assay as an index of the cyclo-oxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1. 3. Heparin-treated blood from the same donors was incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h with the same concentrations of the test compounds in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 microg ml[-1]). The contribution of PGHS-1 was suppressed by pretreatment of the volunteers with aspirin (500 mg; 48 h before venepuncture). As a measure of LPS induced PGHS-2 activity immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 (irPGE2) plasma concentrations were determined by a specific EIA assay. 4. S-ibuprofen inhibited the activity of PGHS-1 (IC50 2.1 microM) and PGHS-2 (IC50 1.6 microM) equally. R-ibuprofen inhibited PGHS-1 (IC50 34.9) less potently than S-ibuprofen and showed no inhibition of PGHS-2 up to 250 microM. By contrast R-ibuprofenoyl-CoA thioester inhibited PGE2 production from LPS-stimulated monocytes almost two orders of magnitude more potently than the generation of TXB2 (IC50 5.6 vs 219 microM). 5. Western blotting of PGHS-2 after LPS induction of blood monocytes showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of PGHS-2 protein expression by ibuprofenoyl-CoA thioesters. 6. These data confirm that S-ibuprofen represents the active entity in the racemate with respect to cyclo-oxygenase activity. More importantly the data suggest a contribution of the R-enantiomer to therapeutic effects not only by chiral inversion to S-ibuprofen but also via inhibition of induction of PGHS-2 mediated by R-ibuprofenoyl-CoA thioester. 7.

This study examined the effects of the COX inhibitors, ketorolac and ibuprofen, and the NOS inhibitor L-NAME for their potential to both inhibit the development and reverse tolerance to the antinociceptive action of morphine. 2. Repeated administration of intrathecal morphine (15 micrograms), once daily, resulted in a progressive decline of antinociceptive effect and an increase in the ED50 value in the tailflick and paw pressure tests. Co-administration of ketorolac (30 and 45 micrograms) or S(+) ibuprofen (10 micrograms) with morphine (15 micrograms) prevented the decline of antinociceptive effect and increase in ED50 value. Similar treatment with L-NAME (100 micrograms) exerted weaker effects. Administration of S(+) but not R(-) ibuprofen (10 mg kg-1) had similar effects on systemic administration of morphine (15 mg kg-1). 3. Intrathecal or systemic administration of the COX or NOS inhibitors did not alter the baseline responses in either tests. Acute keterolac or S(+) ibuprofen also did not potentiate the acute actions of spinal or systemic morphine, but chronic intrathecal administration of these agents increased the potency of acute morphine. 4. In animals already tolerant to intrathecal morphine, subsequent administration of ketorolac (30 micrograms) with morphine (15 micrograms) partially restored the antinociceptive effect and ED50 value of acute morphine, reflecting the reversal of tolerance. Intrathecal L-NAME (100 micrograms) exerted a weaker effect. 5.

The chicken FAAH was inhibited by the substrate analogues oleyl trifluoromethylketone (OTMK) and diazomethylarachidonyl ketone (DAK) with similar potencies to the rat FAAH. However, in contrast to the rat brain, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and the enantiomers of ibuprofen had very weak effects on chicken brain FAAH. Indomethacin and niflumic acid were found to inhibit rat brain AEA hydrolysis. The inhibition by indomethacin was reversible and competitive, with a K(i) value of 120 microM.

Since the role of mechanical stretches in vascular tone regulation is poorly understood, we studied how stretch can influence endothelial tone. 2. Isometric contractions of isolated rat aortic helical strips were recorded. The resting tension was set at 0.7 g, 1.2 g or 2.5 g. Endothelium-preserved strips were precontracted with either phenylephrine or prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)). 3. In control conditions, acetylcholine (ACh) dose-dependently relaxed phenylephrine-precontracted strips independently of resting tension. 4. At 0.7 g resting tension, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors did not reduce ACh-induced relaxation, while either a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor or a NO trapping agent prevented it. At 1.2 g and 2.5 g resting tensions, NOS inhibitors shifted the ACh dose-response curve to the right. 5. After preincubation with indomethacin (5 microM) or ibuprofen (10 and 100 microM), at 0.7 g and 1.2 g resting tensions, ACh induced an endothelium-dependent, dose-dependent contraction. ACh (10(-6) M) increased the contraction up to two times greater the phenylephrine-induced one. Lipoxygenase inhibitors prevented it. At high stretch, the ACh vasorelaxant effect was marginally influenced by cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. Similar results were obtained when aortic strips were precontracted with PGF(2 alpha). 6. Our data indicate that when resting tension is low, ACh mobilizes a stored NO pool that, synergistically with COX-derived metabolites, can relax precontracted strips. COX inhibition up-regulates the lipoxygenase metabolic pathway, accounting for the ACh contractile effect. At an intermediate resting tension, NO production is present, but COX inhibition reveals a lipoxygenase-dependent, ACh-induced contraction. At high resting tension, NO synthesis predominates and COX metabolites influence ACh-induced relaxation marginally.",2000,,"Franchi-Micheli S, Failli P, Mazzetti L, Bani D, Ciuffi M, Zilletti L.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1038/sj.bjp.0703707,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Rat brain hydrolysis of [(3)H]-AEA showed pH dependency with an optimum around pH 8-9. Between pH 6.3 and 8.2, the difference in activity was due to differences in the V(max), rather than the K(M) values. For inhibition of rat brain [(3)H]-AEA metabolism by a series of known FAAH inhibitors, the potencies of the enantiomers of ibuprofen and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) were higher at pH 5.28 than at pH 8.37, whereas the reverse was true for oleyl trifluoromethylketone (OTMK) and arachidonoylserotonin. At both pH values, (-)ibuprofen was a mixed-type inhibitor of FAAH. The K(i)((slope)) and K(i)((intercept)) values for (-)ibuprofen at pH 5.28 were 11 and 143 microM, respectively. At pH 8.37, the corresponding values were 185 and 3950 microM, respectively.

No differences in potencies between the wild type and mutant enzymes were seen. It is concluded that the pharmacological properties of FAAH are highly pH-dependent.

Together with concomitant transepidermal water loss measurements, SC drug concentration-depth profiles were reproducibly determined and fitted mathematically to obtain a partition coefficient, a first-order rate constant related to ibuprofen diffusivity, and the total drug amount in the SC at the end of the application. All derived parameters were consistent across formulations. Ibuprofen permeation data through both silicone membrane and pig ear skin were also fitted to yield partitioning and diffusion parameters. The former revealed that ibuprofen partitioned differently from the gels into this model barrier. Across pig skin, however, better correlation with in vivo results was found.

TRPA1 is activated by exogenous irritants and also by oxidants formed in inflammatory reactions. However, our understanding of its role in inflammation is limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TRPA1 is involved in acute inflammatory edema. The TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced inflammatory edema when injected intraplantarly to mice, mimicking the classical response to carrageenan. Interestingly, the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 and the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen inhibited not only AITC but also carrageenan-induced edema. TRPA1-deficient mice displayed attenuated responses to carrageenan and AITC. Furthermore, AITC enhanced COX-2 expression in HEK293 cells transfected with human TRPA1, a response that was reversed by HC-030031.

However, such measurements need to be linked to effect-based assays to identify risks. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) forms part of a chemical's environmental risk assessment (ERA), and current regulatory testing guidelines to calculate fish BCFs use hundreds of fish per chemical. Due to ethical concerns a reduction in the numbers of animals used is desired, and there is a need to identify in vitro or in silico alternatives which meet regulatory acceptance. This study describes the successful demonstration of a FIsh Gill Cell culture System (FIGCS) to assess an often overlooked parameter in pharmacokinetics: the excretion of drugs across the gill. The FIGCS tolerates the application of natural waters on its apical surface, mimicking the situation of the live fish, and thus in combination with advanced analytical methods, offers an opportunity to take lab-based testing used for ERA, such as compound uptake, biotransformation or excretion directly into field for validation with natural waters. Here we used the basic drug propranolol and the acidic ibuprofen as a demonstration of the FIGCS utility in three separate experiments. Excretion across the apical membrane showed saturation kinetics, suggesting the involvement of carrier-mediated processes. Both propranolol and ibuprofen were excreted across the epithelium from the media (internal blood equivalent) to the water, with ibuprofen excretion being considerably slower than propranolol excretion. Further studies indicate that ibuprofen may be complexing with fetal bovine serum (FBS) reducing bioavailability; in contrast propranolol efflux rate was unaffected, indicating that drugs behave differently in the presence of FBS and other plasma proteins.

Simple coordination chemistry was employed to anchor two kinds of drugs namely isoniazid (IZ - anti-tuberculosis), various non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAIDs) namely ibuprofen-IBU, fenoprofen-FEN, naproxen-NAP, diclofenac-DIC and mefenamic acid-MEF and Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> to synthesize a series of 1D coordination polymers namely IZIBU, IZFEN, IZNAP, IZDIC and IZMEF which were structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD). The coordination polymers wherein both types of drugs were anchored to Zn(II) metal centers could easily be ground to nano-sized particles suitable for biological studies by hand grinding in a mortar and pestle. Zone inhibition studies revealed that all the coordination polymers possessed antibacterial properties against Gram positive, Gram negative and mycobacteria namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Detailed studies carried out on IZDIC employing flow cytometry and confocal microscopy under various staining conditions established that such antibacterial activity was due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as nitric oxide (NO) and also inhibition of mycolic acid leading to incomplete cell wall formation. It was also established that IZDIC could indeed inhibit the growth of M.tb within a mouse macrophage host cell namely RAW 264.7 thereby simulating the treatment of Tuberculosis (TB) under <i>in vitro</i> conditions.

Ibuprofen (IBU) is a potent pain killer which is commonly co-prescribed with PIP and TAZ postoperatively. The combination therapy of PIP, TAZ, and IBU has been administered commonly after surgical procedures to combat aerobic and anaerobic microbes and exert anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. This study describes, for the first time, the development of a new capillary electrophoresis (CE) method with a photodiode array detector for the simultaneous determination of PIP, TAZ, and IBU in plasma samples. The experimental factors affecting the elution of analytes were carefully optimized. The final analysis was achieved using a fused silica capillary (58 cm effective length and 75 μm ID) and a background electrolyte solution containing a methanol/borax buffer solution (15 mM and pH 9.3) in a ratio of (10 : 90 v/v) with a driving voltage of 30 kV and detection at 210 nm. The relationship between the peak area and concentration was linear from 1 to 200 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> for both PIP and TAZ and from 3 to 200 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> for TAZ. The method used was thoroughly validated in accordance with the validation requirements set out by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bio-analytical processes. The proposed CE method was employed to conduct pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies of the drugs in rat models. The pharmacokinetic results revealed that there is a significant impact upon prescribing this combination concurrently when compared to their single administration. To illustrate, the time required to reach their maximum concentrations (<i>T</i> <sub>max</sub>) was increased by 0.25 h for both PIP and TAZ, whereas it was increased by 0.5 for IBU. When it comes to their maximum concentration (<i>C</i> <sub>max</sub>), it was increased by 13.7%, 55.5%, and 44% for PIP, TAZ, and IBU, respectively.

Yet, modern wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) do not remove them sufficiently to alleviate these risks. The present study aimed therefore to explore the effectiveness of an alternative nature-based tertiary treatment of WWTP effluent to remove psychopharmaceuticals. To this end, an algae-mussel trophic cascade setup was designed in which algae were grown in effluent over the course of 11 days and subsequently fed to mussels for a further 3 days. Removal of 30 psychopharmaceuticals for each of the treatments (algae, mussels, algae + mussels) was calculated relative to control samples, and removal efficiency was contextualised by performing an indicative risk assessment. Twelve psychopharmaceuticals were quantified during the experiment, with 11 encountered in all treatments. The compounds fell into 3 categories: positive removal (citalopram, lamotrigine, and venlafaxine), negative removal (carbamazepine, gabapentin, and pregabalin), and no significant changes in concentration (amitriptyline, quetiapine, tramadol, fluvoxamine, lidocaine, and ibuprofen). Both positive and negative removals were largely driven by the presence of the algae rather than that of the mussels. Compounds with a low p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> showed negative removal due to the algal growth induced rise in pH, which was not negated by the mussels at the end of the cascade. Ibuprofen was not removed by any treatment and was also the only compound that represented a substantial risk. The cumulative risks indicated that the algal-mussel cascade actually increased the risk due to the negative removal of compounds present in high concentrations such as carbamazepine. Pregabalin and gabapentin also increased in risk, but did, however, not significantly change the overall risk from the analysed compounds due to their low concentrations.

It has been shown that the NSAID sulindac induces apoptosis and suppresses carcinogenesis, in part, by a mechanism leading to the transcriptional activation of the gene encoding SSAT (spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase), a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism. In the present study, we show that a variety of NSAIDs, including aspirin, sulindac, ibuprofen and indomethacin, can induce SSAT gene expression in Caco-2 cells. Aspirin, at physiological concentrations, can induce SSAT mRNA via transcriptional initiation mechanisms. This induction leads to increased SSAT protein levels and enzyme activity. Promoter deletion analysis of the 5' SSAT promoter-flanking region led to the identification of two NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) response elements. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed binding of NF-kappaB complexes at these sequences after aspirin treatment. Aspirin treatment led to the activation of NF-kappaB signalling and increased binding at these NF-kappaB sites in the SSAT promoter, hence providing a potential mechanism for the induction of SSAT by aspirin in these cells. Aspirin-induced SSAT ultimately leads to a decrease in cellular polyamine content, which has been associated with decreased carcinogenesis. These results suggest that activation of SSAT by aspirin and different NSAIDs may be a common property of NSAIDs that plays an important role in their chemopreventive actions in colorectal cancer.",2006,,"Babbar N, Gerner EW, Casero RA.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1386030?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The purification procedure involved hydrophobic column chromatography using either Ibuprofen-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose or arachidic acid-Sepharose as the first step followed by metal-chelate Sepharose and haemin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme (Mr approximately 65,000) was homogeneous as observed by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The enzyme was a glycoprotein with mannose as the neutral sugar. Haemin or haemoglobin was essential for activity. The purified enzyme could bind haemin exhibiting a characteristic absorption maximum at 410 nm. The enzyme after metal-chelate column chromatography could undergo acetylation by [acetyl-3H]aspirin. The labelled acetylated enzyme could not bind to haemin-Sepharose, presumably due to acetylation of a serine residue involved in the binding to haemin. The acetylated enzyme also failed to show its characteristic absorption maximum at 410 nm when allowed to bind haemin.",1986,,"Boopathy R, Balasubramanian AS.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1147290?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Using the Hospital Discharge Register, all hospitalizations for UGIBs were identified among the 156,138 users of NSAIDs and compared with the number of expected based on the North Jutland population who did not receive NSAID prescriptions.<h4>Results</h4>During periods of NSAID use without use of other drugs associated with UGIB, we observed 365 UGIBs, a number 3.6 times higher than expected (95% CI = 3.3, 4.0). The excess risk varied by sex, type of NSAID and form and route of administration of the NSAID, but not by age at first NSAID prescription or number of prior prescriptions. Risk declined sharply following cessation of use. For ibuprofen and naproxen, there was a clear trend in rising risk by increasing dose, although the lowest doses were also associated with an excess of UGIB. Concurrent use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants and aspirin further increased the risk of UGIB.<h4>Conclusions</h4>All types and formulations of NSAIDs appear to increase the risk of UGIBs, but the effect appear not to be cumulative and diminish rapidly with discontinue of use.

Inhibition of blood COX isoenzymes was determined in vitro before any drug intake and ex vivo after single and repeated intake of either 7.5 mg meloxicam once, 400 mg ibuprofen three times daily or 75 mg diclofenac SR once, taken in a randomized cross-over design. Production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) during clotting and of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during endotoxin exposure served as indicators of platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 activity, respectively. Drugs were determined in plasma by h.p.l.c., with a chiral separation of ibuprofen and free fractions after equilibrium dialysis.<h4>Results</h4>Intra-subject variation for COX-1 and COX-2 at baseline was at 26 +/- 18% and 18 +/- 13% respectively, and intersubject variation at 39% and 36%, respectively. The ratios of IC50s and, at best, of IC80s revealed diclofenac and meloxicam as selective COX-2 inhibitors and ibuprofen as a preferential COX-1 inhibitor in vitro. However, after oral intake, ibuprofen inhibited ex vivo COX-2 by 80% whereas diclofenac inhibited COX-1 by 70%. Meloxicam inhibited COX-1 from 30 to 55% depending on the repetition of the dose and increase in plasma concentrations. Using in vitro dose--response curves, the in vivo inhibitory potency of diclofenac was estimated adequately from its circulating concentration ([-0.18, 0.21] for COX-1 and [-0.13, -0.03] for COX-2) but this was not the case for ibuprofen on COX-2 ([-0.14, 0.27]) and meloxicam on COX-1 ([0.31, 1.05]). The limited predictability of the system was not improved through considering the unbound fraction of the drugs or the variable chiral inversion of ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Assessment of COX-2 selectivity based on in vitro studies and pharmacological modelling has a limited clinical relevance.

We evaluated an experimental pain model for NSAIDs, that included an inflammatory component to mimic clinical inflammatory pain conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>The study was performed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover design on 32 healthy volunteers. A small skin area of the proximal upper leg was irradiated with a UVB source using three times the individually estimated minimal erythema dose. Twenty hours after irradiation skin temperature, heat pain threshold and tolerance in sunburn spot were measured using a thermal sensory testing. These measurements were repeated 2 h after medication of either 800 mg ibuprofen as single oral dose or placebo capsules. Effects of ibuprofen on outcome parameters were assessed with analyses of covariance (ancova).<h4>Results</h4>Placebo did not affect heat pain threshold or tolerance. By contrast, ibuprofen increased heat pain threshold by 1.092 degrees C [confidence interval (CI) 0.498, 1.695; P = 0.0008) compared with placebo. Heat pain tolerance also increased significantly by 1.618 degrees C (CI 1.062, 2.175; P = 0.0001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The pain model we evaluated was well tolerated in all subjects and the effects of ibuprofen were highly significant.

Furthermore, in vivo studies were performed. The permeation studies utilizing static Franz diffusion cells allow the determination of the transdermal (systemic) transport, whereas the penetration studies in vitro (according to the Saarbrücker model) and in vivo permit setting up a concentration-depth profile. For this purpose the permeation kinetics of ketoprofen from three different gels (each containing 2.5% ketoprofen) over a period of two days were determined at heat-separated human skin of different donors. The in vitro permeability coefficients for Test-D (6.50 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)) and Ref-I (5.72 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)) were comparable and the transport occurred for both by a factor of 8-9 faster than with Ref-E (0.78 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)). In parallel to the permeation studies with ketoprofen, the permeability coefficient of caffeine from an ointment was assessed using the skin biopsies of the same donors as a quality assurance. In a second part of the studies, the in vitro penetration of ketoprofen from Test-D was determined over a period of 3 h at three different skin biopsies in comparison to a commercially available 5% ibuprofen gel (Ref-D). As a main result a concentration-depth profile for ketoprofen and ibuprofen could be issued. The ketoprofen (37.7 +/- 12.1 microg/cm2) and the ibuprofen (30.1 +/- 6.0 microg/cm2) penetrate to the same order of magnitude into the upper part of the Stratum corneum, whereas ibuprofen stronger accumulates in the deeper layers (ketoprofen: 27.3 +/- 8.5 microg/cm2; ibuprofen: 73.7 +/- 31.1 microg/cm2). An additional in vivo penetration study was performed with Test-D to set up an in vitro-in vivo (IVIV) correlation.

It is generally believed that COX-1 is constitutively expressed, whereas COX-2 is primarily inducible during inflammation. This study examined the in vivo selectivity of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, and evaluated whether estimates of selectivity that are based on in vitro and ex vivo analyses are reliable indicators of in vivo selectivity.<h4>Methods</h4>Subjects (103 outpatients undergoing surgical removal of two impacted mandibular third molars) received either 200 mg celecoxib, 600 mg ibuprofen, or placebo 8 hours before surgery and a second dose 1 hour before surgery. After surgery, microdialysis probes were placed in the surgical sites for collection of inflammatory transudate. Samples were collected every 20 minutes and pain intensity was estimated concurrently with a visual analog scale and a categorical rating scale for up to 4 hours after surgery.<h4>Results</h4>A significant analgesic effect (P <.01, compared with placebo) was shown for both drugs, with the efficacy of celecoxib being intermediate between ibuprofen and placebo. A similar relationship was observed for the suppression of prostaglandin E(2) (a product of both isoforms) at time points consistent with COX-2 expression (P <.001). Ibuprofen consistently suppressed thromboxane B(2) (a product of COX-1) levels at all time points (P <.05), whereas the effect of celecoxib did not differ from that of placebo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The suppression of products of COX-2 coincident with pain suppression and the absence of COX-1 inhibition suggest that celecoxib is a relatively selective COX-2 inhibitor in vivo.",2002,,"Khan AA, Brahim JS, Rowan JS, Dionne RA.",https://doi.org/10.1067/mcp.2002.125560,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

SMCT, the product of the SLC5A8 gene, is 70% similar to the Na(+)/I(-) symporter, the protein that mediates active I(-) uptake in the basolateral surface of thyrocytes and other cells. SMCT was reported in the apical surface of thyrocytes and formerly proposed also to transport I(-) and was called the apical I(-) transporter. However, it is now clear that SMCT does not transport I(-). Here we demonstrate a high-affinity Na(+)-dependent monocarboxylate transport system in thyroid cells, which is likely to be SMCT. We show that, whereas thyroidal Na(+)/I(-) symporter expression is thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-dependent and basolateral, SMCT expression is TSH-independent and apical not only in the thyroid but also in kidney and colon epithelial cells and in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We determine the kinetic parameters of SMCT activity and show its inhibition by ibuprofen (K(i) = 73 +/- 9 microM) in Xenopus laevis oocytes.

Fluorogenic substrates allow for direct measurement of enzyme activity in situ; however, in contrast to proteases and exo-glycosidases, there are no simple guidelines for the design of selective probes for redox metabolic enzymes. Here, we introduce redox probe 1 and demonstrate its high selectivity in living cells for human hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. AKR1C isoforms perform multiple functions among which the metabolism of potent steroid hormones is well documented. Moreover, expression of these enzymes is responsive to cellular stress and pathogenesis, including cancer. Our probe design is based on redox-sensitive optical switches, which couple a ketone-alcohol redox event to a profound change in fluorescence. The high selectivity of phenyl ketone 1 for AKR1C2 over the many endogenous reductases present in mammalian cells was established by a quantitative comparison of the metabolic rates between null control cells (COS-1) and AKR1C2-transfected cells. Phenyl ketone 1 is a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe that permits a direct, real-time, and operationally simple readout of AKR1C2 enzyme activity in intact mammalian cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that probe 1 enables the quantitative examination of physiological substrate 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (""dark substrate"") in situ by means of a two-substrate competitive assay.

Therefore, we have assessed the relative inhibitory effects of some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on the activities of COX-1 (in bovine aortic endothelial cells) and COX-2 (in endotoxin-activated J774.2 macrophages) in intact cells, broken cells, and purified enzyme preparations (COX-1 in sheep seminal vesicles; COX-2 in sheep placenta). Similar potencies of aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen against the broken cell and purified enzyme preparations indicated no influence of species. Aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen were more potent inhibitors of COX-1 than COX-2 in all models used. The relative potencies of aspirin and indomethacin varied only slightly between models, although the IC50 values were different. Ibuprofen was more potent as an inhibitor of COX-2 in intact cells than in either broken cells or purified enzymes. Sodium salicylate was a weak inhibitor of both COX isoforms in intact cells and was inactive against COX in either broken cells or purified enzyme preparations. Diclofenac, BW 755C, acetaminophen, and naproxen were approximately equipotent inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2 in intact cells. BF 389, an experimental drug currently being tested in humans, was the most potent and most selective inhibitor of COX-2 in intact cells. Thus, there are clear pharmacological differences between the two enzymes. The use of such models of COX-1 and COX-2 activity will lead to the identification of selective inhibitors of COX-2 with presumably less side effects than present therapies.

To examine selectivity of tolerated doses of an inhibitor of the inducible COX-2 in humans, we examined the effects of celecoxib on indices of COX-1-dependent platelet thromboxane (Tx) A2 and on systemic biosynthesis of prostacyclin in vivo. Volunteers received doses of 100, 400, or 800 mg of celecoxib or 800 mg of a nonselective inhibitor, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen, but not celecoxib, significantly inhibited TxA2-dependent aggregation, induced ex vivo by arachidonic acid (83 +/- 11% vs. 11. 9 +/- 2.2%; P < 0.005) and by collagen. Neither agent altered aggregation induced by thromboxane mimetic, U46619.

There was no significant difference between the doses of celecoxib on COX-2 inhibition. Celecoxib and ibuprofen suppressed urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1alpha. These data suggest that (i) platelet COX-1-dependent aggregation is not inhibited by up to 800 mg of celecoxib; (ii) comparable COX-2 inhibition is attained by celecoxib (100-800 mg) and ibuprofen (800 mg) after acute dosing; and (iii) COX-2 is a major source of systemic prostacyclin biosynthesis in healthy humans.",1999,,"McAdam BF, Catella-Lawson F, Mardini IA, Kapoor S, Lawson JA, FitzGerald GA.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.1.272,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

COX-2 is induced during inflammation and is overexpressed in colon cancer. In vitro, an 18-amino acid segment, residues 595-612, immediately upstream of the C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence is required for N-glycosylation of Asn(594), which permits COX-2 protein to enter the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation system. To determine the importance of this COX-2 degradation pathway in vivo, we engineered a del595-612 PGHS-2 (Delta 18 COX-2) knock-in mouse lacking this 18-amino acid segment. Delta 18 COX-2 knock-in mice do not exhibit the renal or reproductive abnormalities of COX-2 null mice. Delta 18 COX-2 mice do have elevated urinary prostaglandin E(2) metabolite levels and display a more pronounced and prolonged bacterial endotoxin-induced febrile response than wild type (WT) mice. Normal brain tissue, cultured resident peritoneal macrophages, and cultured skin fibroblasts from Delta 18 COX-2 mice overexpress Delta 18 COX-2 relative to WT COX-2 expression in control mice. These results indicate that COX-2 can be degraded via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway in vivo. Treatment of cultured cells from WT or Delta 18 COX-2 mice with flurbiprofen, which blocks substrate-dependent degradation, attenuates COX-2 degradation, and treatment of normal mice with ibuprofen increases the levels of COX-2 in brain tissue. Thus, substrate turnover-dependent COX-2 degradation appears to contribute to COX-2 degradation in vivo. Curiously, WT and Delta 18 COX-2 protein levels are similar in kidneys and spleens from WT and Delta 18 COX-2 mice.

In contrast, the slow, time-dependent COX inhibitors (diclofenac, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen) were unaffected by those mutations.

Several crystal structures with or without NSAIDs indicated that placement of a bulky residue at position 89 caused a closure of a gap at the lobby, and alteration of histidine to tryptophan at position 90 changed the electrostatic profile of the side pocket of COX-2.

The in vivo skin penetration test of rats was carried out using Rhodamine B nanoemulsion to simulate the process of drug penetration into the skin, and the frozen section of the skin was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).<h4>Result</h4>FTIR spectra and DSC thermogram of rat skin treated with IBU nanoemulsion showed that infiltration occurred due to disruption of the stratum corneum (SC) protein-lipid structure and increasing of fluidity, hydration, and disruption of the lipid bilayer structure of the SC. The significant reduce in Ea (1.255 kcal/mol) for IBU permeating rat skin suggested crucial disruption of the SC lipid bilayers (P < 0.05), which is speculated that nanoemulsion may create new pathways to promote drug penetration.

The first involves a 65-year-old male who experienced localized pain, swelling, and erythema after the injection. The second case features a 58-year-old male with injection site swelling, tenderness, and presumed cellulitis. We also examine ISR prevalence and severity from clinical trials and real-world data.<h4>Management & outcomes</h4>Both patients received timely care and responded well to appropriate interventions.

In this study, a dual-mediated ibuprofen prodrug modified by glucose (Glu) and vitamin C (Vc) for central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery was designed and synthesized in order to effectively deliver ibuprofen to brain. Ibuprofen could be released from the prepared prodrugs when incubated with various buffers, mice plasma and brain homogenate.

The expression of p75NTR is influenced by epigenetic roles. We explored the effects of ibuprofen on p75NTR expression and investigated whether promoter methylation and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation regulates this process in human gastric cancer cells (SGC7901 and MKN45). Cell lines were treated with ibuprofen 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 µM, and then DNA, RNA, and protein were isolated 24 h later. Expression and promoter methylation of p75NTR were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The levels of m6A-p75NTR were measured by RNA immunoprecipitation. We also used RT-qPCR to determine the levels of m6A-related regulators, METTL3, METTL14, ALKBH5, FTO, YTHDC2, and YTHDF1-3. Ibuprofen attenuated p75NTR promoter methylation (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and increased p75NTR level (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Ibuprofen increased m6A-p53 expression (<i>p</i> < 0.01) by promoting the expression of METTL3 (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and METTL14 (<i>p</i> < 0.05); and increased levels of YTHDF1 (<i>p</i> < 0.001), YTHDF3 (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and YTHDC2 (<i>p</i> < 0.01) that finally reinforced p53 translation (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Therefore, our results present that ibuprofen epigenetically increased p75NTR expression by downregulating promoter methylation and upregulating m6A-RNA-methylation in SGC7901 and MKN45 cells.

The purpose of these studies was to determine the source of the virus-induced oxidative stress. Inhibition of viral replication with antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 had no effect on virus-induced oxidative stress or interleukin-8 (IL-8) response (597+/-88 vs. 668+/-78 pg/mL in control cells). Treatment of cells with diphenylene iodonium inhibited virus-induced oxidative stress and IL-8 elaboration, but allopurinol, ibuprofen, and rotenone had no effect. Studies in cell lines produced from a patient with gp91-phox deficiency revealed normal responses. In contrast, the oxidative response was decreased and the IL-8 concentration was 227+/-36 pg/mL in cells from a patient with p47-phox deficiency, compared with 664+/-48 pg/mL in control cells.

Moreover, CH-induced increased hypoxic sensitivity is blocked by concurrent treatment with the common anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen and dexamethasone. The present study examines the hypothesis that selected cytokines enhance the excitability of oxygen-sensitive type I cells in the carotid body, and that downstream effects of cytokines involve upregulation of the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Cultured type I cells were exposed for 24 h to hypoxia and/or a cocktail of cytokines consisting of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Subsequent evaluation of hypoxia-evoked intracellular Ca(2+)-responses showed that previous exposure to cytokines plus hypoxia resulted in a 110% (p<0.001) increase in cell excitability, whereas exposure to cytokines or hypoxia alone elicited smaller increases of 22% (not significant) and 35% (p<0.01), respectively. These changes were correlated with increased immunostaining for HIF-1α in similarly treated type I cells, where exposure to cytokines plus hypoxia promoted the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor. Moreover, treatment with cytokines and/or hypoxia elevated the expression of the HIF-1-regulated gene, adrenomedullin. These in vitro results are supported by studies which show that elevated type I cell sensitivity following in vivo CH is blocked by concurrent treatment with ibuprofen. The data suggest that CH-induced adaptation in arterial chemoreceptors may in part be mediated by cytokine/hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-1α, and consequent enhanced expression of specific hypoxia-sensitive genes in type I cells.",2013,,"Liu X, He L, Dinger B, Stensaas L, Fidone S.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3612280?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We recently found that Naproxen, but not other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen, Celebrex, Diclofenac), can induce type X collagen gene (COL10A1) expression in bone-marrow-derived MSCs from healthy and OA donors. In this study we determined the effect of Naproxen on COL X protein expression and investigated the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression in normal and OA hMSCs. MSCs of OA patients were isolated from aspirates from the intramedullary canal of donors (50-80 years of age) undergoing hip replacement surgery for OA and were treated with or without Naproxen (100 μg/mL). Protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (COL X, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [p38], phosphorylated-p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase [JNK], phosphorylated-JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK], and phosphorylated-ERK). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the expression of COL10A1 and Runt-related transcription factor 2 gene (Runx2). Our results show that Naproxen significantly stimulated COL X protein expression after 72 h of exposure both in normal and OA hMSCs. The basal phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (ERK, JNK, and p38) in OA hMSCs was significantly higher than in normal. Naproxen significantly increased the MAPK phosphorylation in normal and OA hMSCs. NSAID cellular effects include cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. To investigate the involvement of these pathways in the Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression, we incubated normal and OA hMSCs with Naproxen with and without inhibitors of ERK (U0126), JNK (BI-78D3), p38 (SB203580), and 5-lipoxygenase (MK-886). Our results showed that increased basal COL10A1 expression in OA hMSCs was significantly suppressed in the presence of JNK and p38 inhibitors, whereas Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression was suppressed by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. This study shows that Naproxen induces COL X both at transcriptional and translational levels in normal and OA hMSCs. Elevated basal COL10A1 expression in OA hMSCs is probably through the activation of MAPK pathway and Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression is through the increased 5-lipoxygenase signaling.",2015,,"Alaseem AM, Madiraju P, Aldebeyan SA, Noorwali H, Antoniou J, Mwale F.",https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.TEA.2014.0148,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,18292081,18292081.0,10.1093/brain/awn008,Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition improves amyloid-beta-mediated suppression of memory and synaptic plasticity.,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are associated with a marked reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques containing the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Studies of the effects of NSAIDs upon the inflammatory response surrounding amyloid plaques and upon the generation of Abeta from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) have led to two proposed mechanisms by which NSAIDs may protect against Alzheimer's disease: one, the selective lowering of Abeta42 by a subset of NSAIDs; and two, the reduction of inflammation. Although Alzheimer's disease is a disorder of brain and synaptic function, the effects of NSAIDs on Abeta-mediated suppression of synaptic plasticity and memory function have never been reported. We therefore investigated how three different NSAIDs, chosen for their distinct effects on Abeta42 production and the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, affect memory function and synaptic plasticity. By focusing upon brain and synapse function, we made novel observations about the effects of NSAIDs on Abeta-mediated neural processes. Here we report that the selective inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1, acutely prevented the suppression of hippocampal long-term plasticity (LTP) by Abeta. The non-selective NSAIDs, ibuprofen and naproxen, and a selective COX-2 inhibitor, MF-tricyclic, each restored memory function in Tg2576 mice over-expressing APP, and also blocked Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP. There was no advantage of ibuprofen, a selective Abeta42-lowering agent (SALA), over the non-SALAs, naproxen and MF-tricyclic. The beneficial effects on memory did not depend upon lowered levels of Abeta42 or the inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta). Intriguingly, improved memory function was inversely related to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. Conversely, exogenous PGE2 prevented the restorative effects of COX-2 inhibitors on LTP. The data indicate that the inhibition of COX-2 blocks Abeta-mediated suppression of LTP and memory function, and that this block occurs independently of reductions in Abeta42 or decreases in inflammation. The results lead us to propose a third possible mechanism by which NSAIDs may protect against Alzheimer's disease, involving the blockade of a COX-2-mediated PGE2 response at synapses.",2008,,"Kotilinek LA, Westerman MA, Wang Q, Panizzon K, Lim GP, Simonyi A, Lesne S, Falinska A, Younkin LH, Younkin SG, Rowan M, Cleary J, Wallis RA, Sun GY, Cole G, Frautschy S, Anwyl R, Ashe KH.",http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/131/3/651,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Extra virgin olive oil contains a phenolic compound, oleocanthal, which is thought to share unique chemesthetic qualities with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen. Pilot work suggested participants had difficulty distinguishing between multiple chemesthetic subqualities (e.g., burn, sting, itch, tickle, etc.) in a multiattribute rating task. Here, we assessed overall irritation via direct scaling, and a check all that apply task was used to collect information about chemesthetic subqualities over time. Replicated ratings were collected at discrete intervals using the generalized labeled magnitude scale to generate time-intensity curves; maximum intensity (Imax) and area under the curve were extracted for each participant. Intensity responses varied substantially across participants, and within a participant, the relationship was strongest between ibuprofen and olive oil. However, there were also positive, albeit weaker, correlations between capsaicin and ibuprofen and capsaicin and olive oil. The correlation found between olive oil and capsaicin may suggest the presence of unknown TRPV1 agonists in olive oil. This view was also supported by the qualitative data: capsaicin was described most often as burning and warm/hot, whereas ibuprofen was numbing and tickling. Olive oil shared characteristics with both capsaicin (warm/hot) and ibuprofen (tickle).",2012,,"Bennett SM, Hayes JE.",https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjr129,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The quantity of post-operative analgesics and pain intensity were used to assess the effect of AA. The incidence of analgesia-related side effects, time to discharge from the anesthesia recovery room, heart rate and blood pressure were also recorded. Ibuprofen consumption after surgery in the AA group was lower than in the control group: median 500 versus 800 mg, P = 0.043.

Fever, the regulated increase in the body temperature, is part of the evolved systemic reaction to infection known as the acute phase response. The heat of fever augments the performance of immune cells, induces stress on pathogens and infected cells directly, and combines with other stressors to provide a nonspecific immune defense. Observational trials in humans suggest a survival benefit from fever, and randomized trials published before COVID-19 do not support fever reduction in patients with infection. Like public health measures that seem burdensome and excessive, fevers involve costly trade-offs but they can prevent infection from getting out of control. For infections with novel SARS-CoV-2, the precautionary principle applies: unless evidence suggests otherwise, we advise that fever should be allowed to run its course. Lay summary: For COVID-19, many public health organizations have advised treating fever with medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Even though this is a common practice, lowering body temperature has not improved survival in laboratory animals or in patients with infections. Blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defense against infection. Fever works by causing more damage to pathogens and infected cells than it does to healthy cells in the body.

Managing their removal is however complicated by the difficulties in predicting degradation rates. In this work, we demonstrate that the complexity of the pollutant profile, the set of co-existing contaminants, is a major driver of biodegradation in wastewater. We built representative assemblages out of one to five common pharmaceuticals (caffeine, atenolol, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and enalapril) selected along a gradient of biodegradability. We followed their individual removal by wastewater microbial communities. The presence of multichemical background pollution was essential for the removal of recalcitrant molecules such as ibuprofen. High-order interactions between multiple pollutants drove removal efficiency. We explain these interactions by shifts in the microbiome, with degradable molecules such as paracetamol enriching species and pathways involved in the removal of several organic pollutants.

The legal performance-enhancing drugs caffeine and ibuprofen, which can cause renal injury, are widely used by service members. Whether caffeine or ibuprofen affects RIAKI is unknown. Cilastatin treatment was recently identified as an experimental treatment to prevent RIAKI at injury. To determine potential interacting factors in RIAKI treatment, we test the hypothesis that caffeine and ibuprofen worsen RIAKI and interfere with treatment.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In mice, RIAKI was induced by glycerol intramuscular injection. Simultaneously, mice received caffeine (3 mg/kg), ibuprofen (10 mg/kg), or vehicle. A second cohort received volume resuscitation (PlasmaLyte, 20 mL/kg) in addition to caffeine or ibuprofen. In a third cohort, cilastatin (200 mg/kg) was administered concurrently with drug and glycerol administration. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine output (UOP), renal pathology, and renal immunofluorescence for kidney injury molecule 1 were quantified after 24 hours.<h4>Results</h4>Caffeine did not worsen RIAKI; although BUN was modestly increased by caffeine administration, 24-hour GFR, UOP, and renal histopathology were similar between vehicle-treated, caffeine-treated, and caffeine + PlasmaLyte-treated mice. Ibuprofen administration greatly worsened RIAKI (GFR 14.3 ± 19.5 vs. 577.4 ± 454.6 µL/min/100 g in control, UOP 0.5 ± 0.4 in ibuprofen-treated mice vs. 2.7 ± 1.7 mL/24 h in control, and BUN 264 ± 201 in ibuprofen-treated mice vs. 66 ± 21 mg/dL in control, P < .05 for all); PlasmaLyte treatment did not reverse this effect. Cilastatin with or without PlasmaLyte did not reverse the deleterious effect of ibuprofen in RIAKI.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Caffeine does not worsen RIAKI. The widely used performance-enhancing drug ibuprofen greatly worsens RIAKI in mice. Standard or experimental treatment of RIAKI including the addition of cilastatin to standard resuscitation is ineffective in mice with RIAKI exacerbated by ibuprofen. These findings may have clinical implications for the current therapy of RIAKI and for translational studies of novel treatment.",2023,,"Hebert JF, Eiwaz MB, Nickerson MN, Munhall AC, Pai AA, Groat T, Andeen NK, Hutchens MP.",https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usad142,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In one set of experiments, ASA was also tested in 12-week-old (young adult) rabbits. Renal function was monitored with inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow. The renal vascular resistance was calculated. All three nonspecific cyclo-oxygenase-1 or -2 (COX-1/2) inhibitors caused remarkably similar reversible, oliguric, acute renal failure (ARF). In young adult animals, the side effects were attenuated. The underlying pathophysiology is related to the carefully maintained low GFR of the fetus and the newborn, dependent on a delicate interplay between vasoconstriction (angiotensin II) and vasodilation (prostaglandins [PGs]). When PG-synthesis is inhibited, the vasoconstriction is relatively unopposed, causing ARF.<h4>Literature review</h4>The renal effects of fetal exposure to NSAIDs are discussed, as are new insights into the role of COX-1/2 for a normal nephrogenesis. COX-nil or COX-inhibited animals have long lasting renal structural injury. Fetuses exposed in utero to significant amounts of NSAIDs have at birth various degrees of renal insufficiency and structural renal defects with a very high mortality.<h4>Conclusions</h4>All NSAIDs, both specific and nonspecific COX inhibitors, have renal side effects in the immediate post-natal period and should, therefore, be given with the utmost caution. NSAIDs given during pregnancy for the prevention of toxemia, polyhydramnios and premature labour may affect fetal renal function and structure.

We tested the hypothesis that these pharmaceuticals are endocrine disruptors in fish by examining their impact on interrenal corticosteroidogenesis in rainbow trout. Indeed, acute adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-mediated cortisol production in trout interrenal cells in vitro was significantly depressed (20-40%) by these pharmaceutical drugs. Furthermore, we investigated whether this interrenal dysfunction involved inhibition of the steroidogenic capacity in rainbow trout. To this end, we fed trout salicylate-laced feed (100 mg/kg body weight) for 3 days and assessed the transcript levels of key proteins involved in corticosteroidogenesis, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (P450scc), and 11beta-hydroxylase. Salicylate treatment did not affect the resting plasma cortisol or glucose levels, whereas the acute ACTH-stimulated cortisol production was significantly depressed in the interrenal tissue. This disruption of steroidogenesis by salicylate corresponded to a significant drop in the gene expression of StAR and PBR, but not P450scc or 11beta-hydroxylase, compared to the sham-treated fish. Also, brain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein content and not GR mRNA level was significantly reduced by salicylate. Taken together, salicylate is a corticosteroid disruptor in trout and the targets include the key rate-limiting step in interrenal steroidogenesis and brain glucocorticoid signaling.",2006,,"Gravel A, Vijayan MM.",http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/1/41.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Young men ingested NSAID [1200 mg/d ibuprofen (IBU)] or placebo (PLA) daily for 2 wk before and 4 wk after an electrical stimulation-induced injury to the leg extensor muscles of one leg. Muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis muscles before and after stimulation (2.5 h and 2, 7, and 30 d) and were assessed for satellite cells and regeneration by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR, and we also measured telomere length. After injury, and compared with PLA, IBU was found to augment the proportion of ActiveNotch1(+) satellite cells at 2 d [IBU, 29 ± 3% vs. PLA, 19 ± 2% (means ± sem)], satellite cell content at 7 d [IBU, 0.16 ± 0.01 vs. PLA, 0.12 ± 0.01 (Pax7(+) cells/fiber)], and to expedite muscle repair at 30 d. The PLA group displayed a greater proportion of embryonic myosin(+) fibers and a residual ∼2-fold increase in mRNA levels of matrix proteins (all P < 0.05). Endomysial collagen was also elevated with PLA at 30 d. Minimum telomere length shortening was not observed. In conclusion, ingestion of NSAID has a potentiating effect on Notch activation of satellite cells and muscle remodeling during large-scale regeneration of injured human skeletal muscle.-Mackey, A.

In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 400 mg ibuprofen (pancreas n = 13, aorta n = 13) or a placebo (pancreas n = 13, aorta n = 13) was administered iv before skin incision. MT was applied uniformly. The prostanoid plasma concentrations, venous admixture (Q(va)/Q(t)), and PaO2/FIO2 ratio were determined at baseline (before MT) and 5, 15, 45, and 90 min after MT. Patients who underwent aortic surgery were older and exhibited a lower preoperative PaO2 than those who underwent pancreas resection. Placebo-treated patients revealed a 30-fold peak increase in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (stable metabolite of prostacyclin) levels after intentional MT during aortic as well as pancreatic operations. This response was accompanied by an increase in Q(va)/Q(t) (ibuprofen: pancreas 7% +/- 1%, aorta 14% +/- 2%; placebo: pancreas 16% +/- 3%, aorta 26% +/- 3%/15 min after MT [mean +/- SEM, P < 0.05, placebo vs ibuprofen]), which resulted in decreased PaO2/ FIO2 ratio only in the aortic surgery patients (ibuprofen: 310 +/- 19; placebo: 237 +/- 24 15 min after MT, [mean +/- SEM, P < 0.05]).

Effect of ibuprofen pretreatment.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Surgical stress induces hormonal and cytokine responses proportional to the extent of the injury. Therefore, the authors assessed the effect of ibuprofen pretreatment on metabolic and hormonal changes after surgery.<h4>Summary background data</h4>Postoperative administration of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor reduces cytokine production and nitrogen losses.<h4>Methods</h4>The authors studied the plasma hormones and metabolic and cytokines changes after perioperative ibuprofen administration in 22 patients undergoing cholecystectomy under inhalational anesthesia. Suppositories containing ibuprofen (500 mg) or placebo were administered 12 and 2 hours before surgery, and every 8 hours until the third postoperative day. Blood samples were collected 24 and 2 hours before surgery and 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery for glucose, C-reactive protein, leukocytes, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 determinations.<h4>Results</h4>In both groups, plasma cortisol levels remained elevated for 3 days, whereas plasma ACTH levels returned to the basal level at day 1. The ACTH (p < 0.01), cortisol (p < 0.01), and glucose changes (p < 0.001) were smaller in the ibuprofen group and their duration was shorter. The interleukin-6 levels increased gradually after skin incision until the sixth hour and were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the ibuprofen group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen pretreatment in perioperative course is able to reduce the endocrine response and cytokine release.

Immediately after peritoneal incision, eventration and action of the small bowel was intentionally performed in a uniform fashion.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Baseline values were obtained before induction of anesthesia. Additional measurements, along with assessments of hemodynamics and gas exchange, were performed before incision of the peritoneum and at 5, 30, and 45 mins and 3, 6, and 24 hrs after mesenteric traction. Arterial plasma concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 (stable metabolites of PGI2 and thromboxane A2) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Endotoxin was measured by limulus amebocyte lysate test. Mesenteric lymph nodes were sampled in 31 patients (ibuprofen n = 14, placebo n = 17) and sent for culture under sterile conditions. Transient hypotension and a marked increase of plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations occurred up to 6 hrs after mesenteric traction in untreated patients with median peak concentrations (2243 vs. 72 ng/L [p < .0001, placebo vs. ibuprofen], observed 5 mins after mesenteric traction). Endotoxemia occurred in both study groups. However, after mesenteric traction, plasma endotoxin concentrations were significantly higher in the ibuprofen group. Median peak concentrations (0.12 vs. 0.27 EU/mL [p < .001, placebo vs. ibuprofen]) were observed 3 hrs after mesenteric traction. Gram-negative bacteria in mesenteric lymph nodes were detected exclusively in the ibuprofen group (n = 5, p < .01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In ibuprofen-pretreated patients, significantly higher endotoxin concentrations as well as bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes occurred, despite the absence of a transient decrease in mean arterial pressure that had been associated with PGI2 release. Therefore, we hypothesized that during major abdominal surgery, endogenous PGI2 released in response to mesenteric traction may play a crucial role in maintaining splanchnic microcirculation and thus preserving gut mucosal barrier function.",1996,,"Brinkmann A, Wolf CF, Berger D, Kneitinger E, Neumeister B, Büchler M, Radermacher P, Seeling W, Georgieff M.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00003246-199608000-00005,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Burn prostanoid production, measured in lymph, increased ten- to fifteen-fold for both thromboxane A2, measured as TxB2, and prostacyclin, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The intravenous administration of ibuprofen, 12.5 mg/kg, eliminated both the increase in Ppa and decrease in PaO2 as well as the increase in burn lymph prostanoids. However, plasma prostanoids were also decreased below baseline, a potentially deleterious effect. A topical ibuprofen cream, 5% ibuprofen in a water-soluble ester, was applied to the burn hide every 6 hrs x 4 after which endotoxin was again injected below the hide. The pulmonary dysfunction was prevented as was the increase in plasma TxB2 with the value remaining at baseline. Burn lymph levels were only increased three- to five fold. Ibuprofen levels in burn lymph were maintained at 1-2 mcg/ml. The addition of the cream to the burn, however, did increase the wound bacterial content to 10(5)-10(7) bacteria/gram of tissue compared to 10(2)-10(3) for the dry, untreated burn, probably due to softening of the burn. Topically applied ibuprofen, therefore, can decrease burn wound prostanoid production from local endotoxin, preventing lung dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1986,,"Katz A, Ryan P, Lalonde C, West K, Demling R.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005373-198602000-00011,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Leukocytes play an important role during many processes, including inflammation. They migrate from intravascular spaces into tissues and attack microorganisms. In a recent study, the inhibitory effects of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, on leukocyte transmigration were demonstrated using an in vitro assay. Little is known about the cellular effects of garlic extracts (Allium sativum). The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of garlic extract on leukocyte migration through endothelial cell monolayers and thereby evaluate a possible role in inflammatory processes. Human umbilical endothelial cells were cultured on microporous membranes to make an endothelial cell monolayer (ECM). Freshly isolated neutrophils were used in a recently described migration assay. The amount of untreated neutrophils migrating through the untreated ECM was used as control and set at 100%. Neutrophils and/or ECM were pretreated with garlic extract using moderate, higher, and lower concentrations. Moderate plasma concentrations of garlic extract inhibited neutrophil migration through ECM significantly (64 +/- 5.8% standard deviation [SD]; P < 0.05) when both cell types were treated, (a situation that may have clinical relevance). Treating either neutrophils or ECM alone showed significant reductions in migratory rate (neutrophils treated alone: 81 +/- 7.7% SD, P < 0.05; ECM alone: 70 +/- 6.7%, P < 0.05). Thus, garlic extract is identified as a potent inhibitor of leukocyte migration through endothelial cell monolayers. Treatment of both cell types has an additive effect. Endothelial cells seem to be more affected than neutrophils.

Self-reported pain and fear as well as observer-rated distress were critically important outcomes. Data were combined using standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-five studies that examined breastfeeding (which combines sweet-tasting solution, holding, and sucking), topical anesthetics, sweet-tasting solutions (sucrose, glucose), vapocoolants, oral analgesics, and combination of 2 versus 1 intervention were included. The following results report findings of analyses of critical outcomes with the largest number of participants. Compared with control, acute distress was lower for infants breastfed: (1) during vaccination (n=792): SMD -1.78 (CI, -2.35, -1.22) and (2) before vaccination (n=100): SMD -1.43 (CI, -2.14, -0.72).

Acute and recovery distress was lower for children who received sucrose (n=2071): SMD -0.76 (CI, -1.19, -0.34) or glucose (n=818): SMD -0.69 (CI, -1.03, -0.35) compared with placebo/no treatment. Vapocoolants reduced acute pain in adults [(n=185), SMD -0.78 (CI, -1.08, -0.48)] but not children. Evidence from other needle procedures showed no benefit of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. The administration of topical anesthetics before and breastfeeding during vaccine injections showed mixed results when compared with topical anesthetics alone. There were no additive benefits of combining glucose and non-nutritive sucking (pacifier) compared with glucose or non-nutritive sucking (pacifier) alone or breastfeeding and sucrose compared with breastfeeding or sucrose alone.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Breastfeeding, topical anesthetics, sweet-tasting solutions, and combination of topical anesthetics and breastfeeding demonstrated evidence of benefit for reducing vaccine injection pain in infants and children.

The purpose of this study was to identify molecular targets for NSAIDs related to cellular toxicity with a view to optimize drug efficacy in the clinic. Coronary artery smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells were treated with low (clinically achievable) and high (typically used in preclinical studies) concentrations of celecoxib, NS398, and ibuprofen for 24 hours. NSAIDs-induced gene expression changes were evaluated by microarray analysis and validated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The functional significance of differentially expressed genes was evaluated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. At high concentrations, NSAIDs altered the expression of genes regulating cell proliferation and cell death. NSAIDs also altered genes associated with cardiovascular functions including inflammation, thrombosis, fibrinolysis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. The gene expression was most impacted by ibuprofen, celecoxib, and NS398, in that order. This study revealed that NSAIDs altered expression of an array of genes associated with cardiovascular events and emphasizes the potential for fingerprinting drugs in preclinical studies to assess the potential drug toxicity and to optimize the drug efficacy in clinical settings.",2012,,"Palayoor ST, J-Aryankalayil M, Makinde AY, Cerna D, Falduto MT, Magnuson SR, Coleman CN.",https://doi.org/10.1097/FJC.0b013e31824ba6b5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, the difference between the efficacy and safety of the treatment of PD is not clear. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of simple-needling for PD patients through a comparison with ibuprofen.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive search of 7 electronic databases and relevant medical journals, from the establishment of the publication to December 2020. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria, and a meta-analysis was performed with the Review Manager version (RevMan version 5.3).<h4>Results</h4>Twenty three RCTs were included. The meta-analysis reported that simple-needling groups had better than ibuprofen groups on cure rate (relative risk = 2.29, 95% CI [1.96, 2.68], P < .00001) and total effective rate (relative risk = 1.24, 95% CI [1.19, 1.29], P < .00001) and VAS score (MD = -1.24, 95% CI [-1.92, -0.55], P = .0004). Seven studies reported adverse events, of which 4 studies had mild adverse events.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Simple-needling is superior to ibuprofen treatment in terms of clinical efficacy and improvement of pain symptoms.

After 2 weeks of follow-up, the patient reported an absence of discomfort and exhibited normal results in the liver function test.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Liver failure caused by ibuprofen-sustained release capsules has not been reported. It is worth noting that conventional treatments such as suspending offending agents, and administration of hepatoprotective agents and nutritional support drugs have proven to be successful.<h4>Lesson</h4>There is currently no known peer-reviewed literature indicating that the administration of ibuprofen-sustained release capsules leads to liver failure. When patients taking ibuprofen-sustained release capsules encounter symptoms such as anorexia, skin jaundice, lack of appetite, and nausea, it is recommended that they undertake a cardiac and liver function tests. In the event that ibuprofen-sustained release capsules induce liver injury, it is imperative to administer timely and immediate medical intervention.",2024,,"Liu Y, Liu MW.",https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000036997,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study compares the analgesic efficacy and side effect profiles of a transdermal diclofenac patch versus oral combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Total of 108 patients indicated for surgical extraction of mandibular third molars were randomized into two groups: Group-A (<i>n</i> = 54) received an oral combination of paracetamol (500 mg) and ibuprofen (400 mg), and Group-B (<i>n</i> = 54) received a diclofenac transdermal patch (200 mg). Pain [numeric rating scale (NRS)], rescue analgesics, and side effects were assessed at 12, 24, and 72 hours postoperatively. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential analysis, including independent <i>t</i>-test, analysis of variance, and chi-square test, with a significance threshold at <i>P</i> < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Both groups showed significant pain scores reduction over time. Mean NRS scores at 12, 24 and 72 hours were 3.06, 1.15, and 0.69 (Group-A) vs. 3.46, 1.22, and 0.67 (Group-B) respectively with no statistically significant differences in pain scores between two groups at any time. However, the incidence of side effects, particularly gastric irritation, was significantly higher in Group-A compared to Group-B.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both the transdermal diclofenac patch and the oral combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen are effective in managing postoperative pain following mandibular third molar extraction.

Metabolism is an important factor in controlling circulating plasma and target tissue API concentrations and in generating metabolites which are more easily eliminated in bile, faeces and urine. The essential purpose of xenobiotic metabolism is to convert lipid-soluble, non-polar and non-excretable chemicals into water soluble, polar molecules that are readily excreted. Xenobiotic metabolism is classified into Phase I enzymatic reactions (which add or expose reactive functional groups on xenobiotic molecules), Phase II reactions (resulting in xenobiotic conjugation with large water-soluble, polar molecules) and Phase III cellular efflux transport processes. The human-fish plasma model provides a useful approach to understanding the pharmacokinetics of APIs (e.g. diclofenac, ibuprofen and propranolol) in freshwater fish, where gill and liver metabolism of APIs have been shown to be of importance. By contrast, wildlife species with low metabolic competency may exhibit zero-order metabolic (pharmacokinetic) profiles and thus high API toxicity, as in the case of diclofenac and the dramatic decline of vulture populations across the Indian subcontinent. A similar threat looms for African Cape Griffon vultures exposed to ketoprofen and meloxicam, recent studies indicating toxicity relates to zero-order metabolism (suggesting P450 Phase I enzyme system or Phase II glucuronidation deficiencies).

However, there is no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on analyses of available data, we deduced that the excessive prostaglandins E 2 (PGE 2 ) accumulation mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was the key pathological basis of COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> The urine PGE 2 levels were measured by mass spectrometry. An experimental study about Celebrex to treat COVID-19 was conducted based on routine treatment. A total of 44 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled (Experimental group n=37, Control group n=7).

This study analyzed the electrostatic interaction energies of selected NSAIDs (flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, meloxicam and celecoxib) with the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2, revealing significant differences in binding profiles. Flurbiprofen exhibited the strongest interactions with both COX-1 and COX-2, indicating its potent binding affinity. Celecoxib and meloxicam showed a preference for COX-2, consistent with their known selectivity for this isoform, while ibuprofen showed comparable interaction energies with both isoforms, reflecting its nonselective inhibition pattern. Key amino-acid residues, including Arg120, Arg/His513 and Tyr355, were identified as critical determinants of NSAID selectivity and binding affinity. The findings highlight the complex interplay between interaction energy and selectivity, suggesting that while electrostatic interactions play a fundamental role, additional factors such as enzyme dynamics and the hydrophobic effect also contribute to the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of NSAIDs.

This leads to its discharge into the environment, causing considerable environmental concerns. The use of microorganisms has recently been recognized as a sustainable method for mitigating IBU contamination in wastewater. In this study, new bacteria capable of growing in a solid medium with IBU as the only carbon source and removing IBU from a liquid medium were isolated from environmental samples, including soil, marine, mine, and olive mill wastewater. Four bacterial strains, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae TIBU2.1, Klebsiella variicola LOIBU1.1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LOIBU1.2, and Mycolicibacterium aubagnense HPB1.1, were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These strains demonstrated significant IBU removal efficiencies, ranging from 60 to 100% within 14 days, starting from an initial IBU concentration of 5 mg per litre. These bacteria have not been previously reported in the literature as IBU degraders, making this work a valuable contribution to further studies in the field of bioremediation in environments contaminated by IBU. Based on the IBU removal results, the most promising bacteria, K. pneumoniae TIBU2.1 and M. aubagnense HPB1.1, were selected for an in silico analysis to identify genes potentially involved in IBU biodegradation. Interestingly, in the tests with TIBU2.1, a peak of IBU transformation product(s) was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography, while in the tests with HPB1.1, it was not detected. The emerging peak was analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, indicating the presence of possible conjugates between intermediates of IBU biodegradation. The proteins encoded on their whole-genome sequences were aligned with proteins involved in an IBU-degrading pathway reported in bacteria with respective catabolic genes. The analysis indicated that strain HPB1.1 possesses genes encoding proteins similar to most enzymes reported associated with the IBU metabolic pathways used as reference bacteria, while strain TIBU2.1 has genes encoding proteins similar to enzymes involved in both the upper and the lower part of that pathway.

Carboxylate bioactivation into reactive metabolites (e.g., acyl glucuronides, AG) and resulting T-cell activation is hypothesized as causal for this adverse event. However, conclusive evidence supporting this is lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>In this work, we identify CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell hepatic infiltration in a biopsy from an IBU DILI patient. Lymphocyte transformation test and IFN-γ ELIspot, conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with NAP-DILI, were used to explore drug-specific T-cell activation. T-cell clones (TCC) were generated and tested for drug specificity, phenotype/function, and pathways of T-cell activation. Cells were exposed to NAP, its oxidative metabolite 6-O-desmethyl NAP (DM-NAP), its AG or synthesized NAP-AG human-serum albumin adducts (NAP-AG adduct).<h4>Results</h4>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from patients expressing a range of different Vβ receptors were stimulated to proliferate and secrete IFN-γ and IL-22 when exposed to DM-NAP, but not NAP, NAP-AG or the NAP-AG adduct. Activation of the CD4<sup>+</sup> TCC was HLA-DQ-restricted and dependent on antigen presenting cells (APC); most TCC were activated with DM-NAP-pulsed APC, while fixation of APC blocked the T-cell response.

MED,36148604,36148604.0,10.1111/apha.13888,Uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease highlight a fundamental gap in understanding their detrimental effects on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an estimated 700-800 and 523 million cases worldwide, respectively, with CVD being the leading cause of death in CKD patients. The pathophysiological interplay between the heart and kidneys is defined as the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), in which worsening of kidney function is represented by increased plasma concentrations of uremic toxins (UTs), culminating in dialysis patients. As there is a high incidence of CVD in CKD patients, accompanied by arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, knowledge on electrophysiological remodeling would be instrumental for understanding the CRS. While the interplay between both organs is clearly of importance in CRS, the involvement of UTs in pro-arrhythmic remodeling is only poorly investigated, especially regarding the mechanistic background. Currently, the clinical approach against potential arrhythmic events is mainly restricted to symptom treatment, stressing the need for fundamental research on UT in relation to electrophysiology. This review addresses the existing knowledge of UTs and cardiac electrophysiology, and the experimental research gap between fundamental research and clinical research of the CRS. Clinically, mainly absorbents like ibuprofen and AST-120 are studied, which show limited safe and efficient usability. Experimental research shows disturbances in cardiac electrical activation and conduction after inducing CKD or exposure to UTs, but are scarcely present or focus solely on already well-investigated UTs. Based on UTs data derived from CKD patient cohort studies, a clinically relevant overview of physiological and pathological UTs concentrations is created. Using this, future experimental research is stimulated to involve electrophysiologically translatable animals, such as rabbits, or in vitro engineered heart tissues.",2022,,"van Ham WB, Cornelissen CM, van Veen TAB.",https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13888,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To illustrate this, the stepwise development of an integrated disease/pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model of antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is presented along with therapy optimization suggestions.<h4>Method</h4>Published clinical trials, in vitro data, and drug physiochemical properties were used to develop an ibuprofen-mediated antipyresis model for febrile children also having CF. Workflow included first developing a mechanistic absorption model using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation followed by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. The verified PBPK model was then scaled to paediatric patients with CF. Once verified, the PBPK model was linked to an indirect response model of antipyresis for simulation of the overall antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen in CF children.<h4>Results</h4>Model simulations showed therapeutic inequivalence between healthy children and paediatric patients with CF; C<sub>max</sub> and AUC decreased by 39% (32-46%) and 44% (36-52%), respectively, in patients. Further, and in agreement with literature reports, predicted pharmacodynamics time courses suggest a slower onset and faster offset of action in patients compared to healthy children, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Exploratory simulations suggest an increase in dosing frequency for CF children as a better therapeutic strategy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Model-informed approaches to leveraging knowledge obtained throughout the life cycle of drug development may play a key role in extrapolating drug efficacy and safety to underrepresented populations.",2020,,"Cicali B, Long T, Kim S, Cristofoletti R.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/bcp.14326,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To date, the only anti-inflammatory drug available to CF patients is high-dose ibuprofen, which can slow pulmonary disease progression, but whose cyclooxygenase-dependent digestive adverse effects limit its clinical use. Here we have tested sulindac, another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with an undefined anti-inflammatory effect in CF airway epithelial cells.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>Using in vitro and in vivo models, we NF-κB activity and IL-8 secretion. In HeLa-F508del cells, we performed luciferase reporter gene assays in order to measure i) IL-8 promoter activity, and ii) the activity of synthetic promoter containing NF-κB responsive elements. We quantified IL-8 secretion in airway epithelial CFBE cells cultured at an air-liquid interface and in a mouse model of CF.<h4>Key results</h4>Sulindac inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and decreased IL-8 transcription and secretion in TNF-α stimulated CF cells via a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism. This effect was confirmed in vivo in a mouse model of CF induced by intra-tracheal instillation of LPS, with a significant decrease of the induction of mRNA for MIP-2, following treatment with sulindac.<h4>Conclusion and implications</h4>Overall, sulindac decrease lung inflammation by a mechanism independent of cycolooxygenase.

Eucalyptol interacts with the TRP cation channels among other targets, but it is unclear which of these mediates its anti-inflammatory effects.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>Effects of eucalyptol were compared in wild-type and TRPM8 channel-deficient mice in two different models: footpad inflammation elicited by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and pulmonary inflammation following administration of LPS. Oedema formation, behavioural inflammatory pain responses, leukocyte infiltration, enzyme activities and cytokine and chemokine levels were measured.<h4>Key results</h4>In the CFA model, eucalyptol strongly attenuated oedema and mechanical allodynia and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6), effects comparable with those of ibuprofen. In the LPS model of pulmonary inflammation, eucalyptol treatment diminished leukocyte infiltration, myeloperoxidase activity and production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ and IL-6. Genetic deletion of TRPM8 channels abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of eucalyptol in both models. Eucalyptol was at least sixfold more potent on human, than on mouse TRPM8 channels. A metabolite of eucalyptol, 2-hydroxy-1,8-cineol, also activated human TRPM8 channels.<h4>Conclusion and implications</h4>Among the pharmacological targets of eucalyptol, TRPM8 channels were essential for its anti-inflammatory effects in mice. Human TRPM8 channels are more sensitive to eucalyptol than rodent TRPM8 channels explaining the higher potency of eucalyptol in humans. Metabolites of eucalyptol could contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects. The development of more potent and selective TRPM8 agonists may yield novel anti-inflammatory agents.",2017,,"Caceres AI, Liu B, Jabba SV, Achanta S, Morris JB, Jordt SE.",https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.13760,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,28542719,28542719.0,10.1111/bph.13867,Ibuprofen and diclofenac treatments reduce proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells upon inflammatory injury and mitogenic stimulation.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are administered to manage the pain typically found in patients suffering from pancreatitis. NSAIDs also display anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells; however, their effects on normal, untransformed cells are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated whether NSAIDs inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells during the development of acute pancreatitis.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>The NSAIDs ibuprofen and diclofenac were administered to C57BL/6 mice after induction of pancreatitis with serial injections of cerulein. In addition, ibuprofen was administered concomitantly with 3,5,3-L-tri-iodothyronine (T3), which induces acinar cell proliferation in the absence of tissue inflammation. The development of pancreatic inflammation, acinar de-differentiation into metaplastic lesions and acinar proliferation were quantified by histochemical, biochemical and RT-PCR approaches.<h4>Key results</h4>Therapeutic ibuprofen treatment selectively reduced pancreatic infiltration of activated macrophages in vivo, and M1 macrophage polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression both in vivo and in vitro. Reduced macrophage activation was accompanied by reduced acinar de-differentiation into acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. Acinar proliferation was significantly impaired in the presence of ibuprofen and diclofenac, as demonstrated at both the level of proliferation markers and expression of cell cycle regulators. Ibuprofen also reduced acinar cell proliferation induced by mitogenic stimulation with T3, a treatment that does not elicit pancreatic inflammation.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Our study provides evidence that the NSAIDs ibuprofen and diclofenac inhibit pancreatic acinar cell division. This suggests that prolonged treatment with these NSAIDs may negatively affect the regeneration of the pancreas and further studies are needed to confirm these findings in a clinical setting.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Inventing New Therapies Without Reinventing the Wheel: The Power of Drug Repurposing.

This study investigated whether dietary antioxidants could protect against this damage via protein kinase AMP-activated alpha (AMPKα)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathways.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with antibiotics (kanamycin, azithromycin, ampicillin or ciprofloxacin) plus ibuprofen with or without antioxidants. Azithromycin/ibuprofen induced hepatotoxicity was evaluated in C57BL/6J mice. Mitochondrial parameters including morphology, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) and key proteins (mitofusin 2, AMPKα, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [GSK3B], NRF2 and haem oxygenase 1 [HO1]) were analysed.<h4>Key results</h4>Antibiotics/ibuprofen combinations triggered mitochondrial fission, ROS overproduction and mitofusin 2 down-regulation. Four antioxidants, that is, coniferaldehyde, raspberry ketone, gastrodin and eugenol, restored mitochondrial function and morphology. Coniferaldehyde and raspberry ketone effectively prevented in vivo hepatotoxicity and inflammation. Moreover, coniferaldehyde/raspberry ketone activated NRF2/HO1 while restoring AMPKα/GSK3B signalling.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Coniferaldehyde and raspberry ketone showed potent rescue effects in vitro against all antibiotic models and in vivo against azithromycin/ibuprofen-induced hepatotoxicity through AMPKα-GSK3B/NRF2-HO1 modulation, with favourable safety profiles.",2026,,"Zhao J, Shang B, Xu S, Zheng D, Zhang X, Lv J, Dong Y, Yang X.",https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.70191,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In animal experiments, 32 SD rats were randomly divided into the sham operation group, the chronic constrictive injury (CCI) group, the ibuprofen group, and the paeonol group. We performed behavioral testing, ELISA, PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The pseudotime analysis of microglia found that RhoA, Rock1, and p38MAPK were highly expressed in activated microglia, and the expression patterns of these genes were consistent with the expression trends of the M1 markers CD32 and CD86. Paeonol decreased the levels of M1 markers (IL1β, iNOS, CD32, IL6) and increased the levels of M2 markers (IL10, CD206, ARG-1) in LPS-induced microglia. The expression of iNOS, IL1β, RhoA, and Rock1 was significantly increased in LPS-treated microglia, while paeonol decreased the expression of these proteins. Thermal hyperalgesia occurred after CCI surgery, and paeonol provided relief. In addition, paeonol decreased the levels of IL1β and IL8 and increased the levels of IL4 and TGF-β in the serum of CCI rats. Paeonol decreased expression levels of M1 markers and increased expression levels of M2 markers in the spinal cord. Paeonol decreased IBA-1, IL1β, RhoA, RhoA-GTP, COX2, Rock1, and p-p38MAPK levels in the spinal dorsal horn.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Paeonol relieves neuropathic pain by modulating microglial M1 and M2 phenotypes through the RhoA/p38 MAPK pathway.",2023,,"Li X, Shi H, Zhang D, Jing B, Chen Z, Zheng Y, Chang S, Gao L, Zhao G.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.14211,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In animal experiments, 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the sham operation group, CCI group, ibuprofen group, and stigmasterol group. We performed behavioral tests, ELISA, H&E staining and immunohistochemistry, and western blotting.<h4>Results</h4>Cell communication analysis by single-cell sequencing reveals that after peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells secrete IL-34 to act on CSF1R in macrophages. After peripheral nerve injury, the mRNA expression levels of CSF1R pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages were increased in DRG. In vitro studies demonstrated that stigmasterol can reduce the secretion of IL-34 in LPS-induced RSC96 Schwann cells; stigmasterol treatment of LPS-induced Schwann cell-conditioned medium (L-S-CM) does not induce the proliferation and migration of RAW264.7 macrophages; L-S-CM reduces CSF1R signaling pathway (CSF1R, P38MAPK, and NFκB) activation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and ROS production.

We hypothesized that NSAIDs may be delivered locally in a wound for heterotopic ossification prophylaxis. In in vitro work, we cultured osteoblasts with three commercially available NSAIDs and then measured cell viability and DNA content. Indomethacin caused a 50% decrease in DNA at the lowest dose (0.0001 mM) and the most potent decrease in cell viability (<10% of control at 0.0005 mM). Ketorolac and ibuprofen required 10 times the dose to achieve a comparable decrease (<20% of control at 0.005 mM). In an animal study, 20 rats per treatment group received a full-thickness wound dressed with either saline-moistened gauze, saline-moistened chitosan sponge, or chitosan sponge loaded with indomethacin. After 28 days, we examined the tissue for healing. Wounds exposed to indomethacin loaded sponges demonstrated fewer inflammatory cells. All 20 rats in the indomethacin group had complete epithelial coverage at 28 days. Eighteen (90%) wounds in the saline-chitosan group and 11 (55%) wounds in the saline-gauze group were healed.

The aim of this study was to establish a simple and reliable experimental pain model that could distinguish the analgesic effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment from placebo in human volunteers. 2. The reproducibility and reliability over time of subject pain ratings was compared using cutaneous electrical stimuli applied to either the thenar eminence or the ear lobe at varying intensities and modes. Subjects were asked to respond firstly, when the stimulus became clearly sharp and painful ('first pain') and secondly, when the sensation became deep and burning and no further increase in stimulus intensity could be tolerated ('second pain'). 3. Constant voltage stimuli were found to be more reproducible than constant current stimuli. Both phasic (intermittent) and tonic (continuous) stimulation modalities produced 'first' and 'second pain' sensations. The latter sensation was more reproducible, and was perceived as a burning pain which is akin to clinical pain. 4. Analgesics from the NSAID class were found to attenuate reliably only 'second pain' sensations.

The effects of racemic (rac) ibuprofen and its S(+)- and R(-)-enantiomers on functions of human polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and platelets were studied in vitro. 2. Rac-ibuprofen inhibited PMN functions (O2- generation, beta-glucuronidase release, LTB4 formation). Similar IC50 values (40-100 microM) were obtained for the S(+)- and R(-)-enantiomers. 3. All forms of ibuprofen inhibited cyclooxygenase-related platelet functions (aggregation, thromboxane formation). The S(+)-enantiomer was about twice as active as the racemate while the R(-)-enantiomer was at least 10-fold less active. This demonstrates that the S(+) is the only cyclooxygenase inhibitory component of the racemate. 4. The concentrations of rac-ibuprofen in PMN and platelets were similar to those in the incubation medium and represented equal concentrations of the enantiomers. This indicates that neither interconversion nor tissue accumulation of the compounds occurred. 5. These data indicate that antineutrophil effects of ibuprofen on human PMN are independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition.

It is well known that an individual subject often responds preferentially to a particular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and clinical response to these drugs is characterised by considerable variability between individuals. Variability in response has often been attributed to the episodic nature of musculoskeletal disease. Few studies have studied intrasubject variability in response to these drugs using a multiple crossover design. A major difficulty has been the lack of objective, validated measures of inflammation sensitive to NSAIDs. The primary aim of the present study was to test the utility of urate-crystal induced inflammation as a tool to predict NSAID response in humans. 2. An inflammatory reaction was established in twenty-five healthy subjects with intradermal injection of urate crystals on four separate occasions separated by 1 week. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive either ibuprofen on two of these occasions (800 mg four times over 36 h) or matched placebo on the other two occasions using a double-blind, cross-over design. Decrease in the area under the wheal size-time curve was used to indicate anti-inflammatory response. 3. Peak inflammatory response was observed at about 32 h and had dissipated by 56 h post-urate injection. The logarithmic mean wheal area was significantly lower after ibuprofen (mean +/- s.e. mean; 6.74 +/- 0.09) compared with placebo (6.96 +/- 0.07 mm h); a difference of 20% (95% confidence interval for difference: 1 to 35%; P < 0.05). 4.

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a localized hyperalgesia model induced by cutaneous freeze injury to evaluate the pharmacodynamic profile of weak analgesic agents in healthy volunteers.<h4>Method and results</h4>Two groups of 24 healthy volunteers were enrolled in controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over studies. After freeze injury, punctate mechanical pain thresholds (MPT) were measured over three consecutive daily sessions to characterize the induced hyperalgesia and compare the effects of (i) oral ibuprofen and acetaminophen and (ii) oral and topical ibuprofen vs. placebo. The freeze injury model provides two types of hyperalgesia, primary and secondary, stable over 72 h. The MPT values (means; 95% confidence interval) in the primary (38.9 g; 34.3, 43.5) and secondary (82.2 g; 81.4, 88.0) areas of hyperalgesia were different from normal skin (107.5 g; 101.5, 115.2). This model clearly showed the antihyperalgesic effect of both systemic and topical ibuprofen (42.1%; 26.6, 61.2 and 33.8%; 16.4, 51.2 of MPT increase, respectively) but not that of acetaminophen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Cutaneous freeze injury coupled with a von Frey electronic device to assess the mechanical pain threshold is a convenient model that causes no discomfort.

However, this rise was short-lived, presumably as a result of concerns that the safety concerning rofecoxib may be a class effect. A parallel increase in the prescription of diclofenac and ibuprofen was also noted, suggesting that prescribers were prescribing these medications as alternatives to COX-2 inhibitors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While prescribers and their patients may have initially interpreted safety concerns regarding rofecoxib to be drug specific, prescribers appear to have interpreted this effect to be class specific.",2006,,"Williams D, Singh M, Hind C.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02691.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In isolated perfused rat liver, the time-course of volume-regulatory K+ efflux following exposure to hypoosmolar perfusate resembled the leukotriene-C4-induced K+ efflux in normotonic perfusion. Omission of Ca2+ from the perfusion fluid had no effect on volume-regulatory K+ efflux, but abolished completely the leukotriene-C4-induced K+ efflux. 2. Volume-regulatory K+ fluxes following hypoosmolar exposure (225 mOsmol l-1) and subsequent reexposure to normotonic media (305 mOsmol l-1) were not significantly affected by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (5 mumol l-1) or ibuprofen (50 mumol l-1), the leukotriene D4/C4-receptor antagonist 1-[2-hydroxy-3-propyl-4-[4-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]phenyl]etha none (YL 171883, 50 microM), the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 microM), the phospholipase-A2 inhibitor bromophenacyl bromide (50 microM) or the thromboxane-receptor antagonist 4-[2-(benzenesulfonamido)ethyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (BM 13.177, 20 microM). Also the effects of hypoosmotic cell swelling on lactate, pyruvate and glucose balance across the liver remained largely unaffected in presence of these inhibitors. Neither exposure of perfused rat liver to hypoosmolar (225 mOsmol l-1) nor to hyperosmolar (385 mOsmol l-1) perfusion media affected hepatic prostaglandin-D2 release. 3. When livers were 3H-labeled in vivo by an intraperitoneal injection of myo-[2-3H]inositol about 16 h prior to the perfusion experiment, cell swelling due to lowering the perfusate osmolarity from 305 mOsmol l-1 to 225 mOsmol l-1 led to about a threefold stimulation of [3H]inositol release. The maximum of hypotonicity-induced [3H]inositol release preceded maximal volume-regulatory K+ efflux by about 30 s, but came after the maximum of water shift into the cells. Hypotonicity-induced [3H]inositol release was largely prevented in presence of Li+ (10 mM), but simultaneously inositol monophosphate accumulated inside the liver within 10 min and a small, but significant increase of inositol trisphosphate 1 min after onset of hypoosmolar exposure was detectable. No stimulation of [3H]inositol release was observed during cell shrinkage by switching the perfusate osmolarity from 225 mOsmol l-1 to 305 mOsmol l-1 or from 305 mOsmol l-1 to 385 mOsmol l-1. No stimulation of [3H]inositol release was observed upon swelling of preshrunken livers by lowering the osmolarity from 385 mOsmol l-1 to 305 mOsmol l-1, although the volume-regulatory K+ efflux under these conditions was almost identical to that observed after lowering the osmolarity from 305 mOsmol l-1 to 225 mOsmol l-1. 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1991,,"vom Dahl S, Hallbrucker C, Lang F, Häussinger D.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15988.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Net K+ release roughly paralleled the amount of GSSG released from the liver under the influence of the hydroperoxide. The t-butylhydroperoxide-induced K+ efflux was inhibited by approximately 70% in the presence of Ba2+ (1 mM), by 30% in Ca(2+)-free perfusions and was decreased by 50-60% when the intracellular Ca2+ stores were simultaneously depleted by repeated additions of phenylephrine. t-Butylhydroperoxide-induced K+ efflux was accompanied by a decrease of the intracellular water space by 58 +/- 14 microliter/g (n = 4), corresponding to a 10% cell shrinkage. The effect of t-butylhydroperoxide on cell volume was inhibited by 70-80% in the presence of Ba2+. In isolated rat hepatocytes treatment with t-butylhydroperoxide led to a slight hyperpolarization of the membrane at concentrations of 100 nM, but marked hyperpolarization occurred at t-butylhydroperoxide concentrations above 10 microM. t-Butylhydroperoxide (0.2 mM) transiently increased the portal-perfusion pressure by 3.3 +/- 0.6 cm H2O (n = 18), due to a slight stimulation of prostaglandin-D2 release under the influence of the hydroperoxide. In the presence of Ba2+ (1 mM), t-butylhydroperoxide increased the perfusion pressure by 12.7 +/- 1.2 cm H2O (n = 9) and produced an approximately tenfold increase of prostaglandin-D2 and thromboxane-B2 release. Under these conditions, glucose output from the liver rose from 0.9 +/- 0.03 to 2.9 +/- 0.7 mumol.g-1.min-1 (n = 4) with a time course roughly resembling that of portal-pressure increase and prostaglandin-D2 overflow. These effects were largely abolished in the presence of ibuprofen or the thromboxane-receptor-antagonist BM 13.177. The t-butylhydroperoxide effects on perfusion pressure, glucose and eicosanoid output were also enhanced in the presence of insulin or during hypotonic exposure; i.e. conditions known to swell hepatocytes, but not during hyperosmotic exposure. The data suggest that t-butylhydroperoxide induces liver-cell shrinkage and hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane due to activation of Ba(2+)-sensitive K+ channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1993,,"Hallbrucker C, Ritter M, Lang F, Gerok W, Häussinger D.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17570.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Intravenous injection of Paf at a dose of 15 micrograms kg-1 is uniformly lethal, and the rabbits died within 4.5 +/- 0.4 min. The sudden death is characterized by cessation of respiration, a marked decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (M.A.B.P.), and 8 fold increases in plasma thromboxane B2 (TxB2) concentrations with only modest elevation in plasma 6 keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto PGF1 alpha) concentrations.

Protected rabbits showed only modest changes in M.A.B.P. and no significant increase in plasma TxB2 concentrations. The protective drugs showed a dose-related action on M.A.B.P., plasma TxB2 concentration and mortality rate in Paf-induced sudden death. The mechanisms of the protection appeared to be prevention of platelet aggregation (leading to pulmonary thrombosis) and pulmonary and coronary vasoconstriction. However, Paf does not appear to exert direct vasoconstrictor effects in isolated coronary or pulmonary arteries. The effects of Paf in vivo appear to be mediated by TxA2 released by activated platelets in the absence of the protective effects of prostacyclin.

In the present study, the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit cyclo-oxygenase activity, on glycogenolysis was examined in the hepatocyte model. Ibuprofen (80 microM), indomethacin (50 microM) and meclofenamate (60 microM) all increased rates of glycogenolysis when added under basal conditions. In contrast, piroxicam (50 microM) had no effect on glycogenolysis in the hepatocyte system. Concentrations of ibuprofen below 80 microM did not significantly increase rates of glycogenolysis. Ibuprofen (80 microM) had no effect on glycogenolysis in the presence of 10(-5)M adrenaline or 5 X 10(-7)M glucagon, but did increase glycogenolytic rates in the presence of 5 X 10(-8)M glucagon. Ibuprofen-stimulated glycogenolysis was inhibited by addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Under conditions where glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis was inhibited by exogenous PGE2, addition of ibuprofen (80 microM) increased the rate of glycogenolysis. Ibuprofen had no effect on basal or glucagon-stimulated hepatocyte adenylate cyclase activity. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are carboxylic acids can increase the rate of glycogenolysis in isolated hepatocytes. The high concentrations of drug required to stimulate glycogenolysis, the lack of effect of piroxicam, and the demonstration of stimulation by ibuprofen in the presence of exogenous PGE2 all suggest that the stimulation of glycogenolysis by ibuprofen, indomethacin and meclofenamate is independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition.

Epidermal growth factor-urogastrone (EGF-URO) caused a concentration-dependent contractile response of longitudinal muscle strips from the gastric body of the guinea-pig stomach. The contractile response to EGF-URO was monophasic, with tension returning rapidly to baseline. Desensitization was evident in that further addition of EGF-URO to the organ bath did not cause a second contraction. 2. Preincubation with indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin markedly inhibited the contractions induced by EGF-URO with an order of potency (indomethacin greater than naproxen greater than ibuprofen greater than aspirin) that reflected the ability of these agents to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase. 3. The data indicate that prostanoids mediate the action of EGF-URO in the longitudinal muscle preparation. 4. Auranofin (0.5 to 50 microM), a chrysotherapeutic agent with antiproliferative properties used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, also markedly inhibited the EGF-URO response; however, other gold-containing compounds (aurothioglucose or gold sodium thiomalate at 30 to 100 microM) failed to cause significant inhibition. 5. Preincubation of preparations for 2 h with 1 microM hydrocortisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone caused an inhibition of EGF-URO-induced contraction of approximately 50%. However, steroids lacking either a 17 alpha-hydroxyl (corticosterone) or an 11 beta-hydroxyl (cortisone, deoxycorticosterone, prednisone) substituent did not inhibit the contraction caused by EGF-URO. For hydrocortisone, the inhibitory effect was half-maximal at 0.2 microM and was maximal at 1 microM. Cycloheximide (10 microM) blocked the inhibitory action of hydrocortisone and potentiated the contractile action of EGF-URO. 6. The ability of a variety of steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents to interfere with the action of EGF-URO in a smooth muscle preparation suggests that these agents may also inhibit the action of EGF-URO mediated by prostanoids in other target tissues. 7.

The characteristics of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-induced oedema formation were investigated in vivo in rabbit skin. 2. FMLP injected intradermally alone induced a small increase in plasma leakage, but marked synergism with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in producing oedema responses was observed. In the presence of PGE2, FMLP was equiactive with C5a des Arg and 100-1000 times more active than histamine in terms of permeability-increasing activity. The response to FMLP was not dependent on endogenous histamine release. 3. FMLP-induced responses were of long duration (t1/2 approximately 40-50 min) when compared with bradykinin (t1/2 approximately 4-5 min). 4. The activity of a range of N-formyl peptides in increasing vascular permeability in skin correlated well with their activity as neutrophil stimulants in vitro. 5. Intravenous infusion of zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) resulted in transient neutropenia and inhibition of oedema formation induced by FMLP and C5a des Arg in the skin. Responses to bradykinin were unaffected by the infusion of ZAP. 6. Intravenous injection of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, resulted in an inhibition of FMLP-induced, but not histamine-induced, oedema formation. This effect was independent of cyclo-oxygenase inhibition and the drug did not induced neutropenia. 7. Intravenous injection of the microtubule blocking agent colchicine inhibited FMLP-induced oedema formation. Responses to bradykinin were unaffected. When colchicine was administered after intradermal FMLP, subsequent plasma leakage was abolished. 8. The inference that receptors have evolved to bacterial secretions (i.e. FMLP) and products of the interaction of bacterial cell walls with tissue fluid (i.e. C5a des Arg), is consistent with the hypothesis that oedema formation is fundamentally a functional process concerned with regulating microbial lysis and opsonisation in an infected tissue.",1989,,"Hellewell PG, Yarwood H, Williams TJ.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1989.tb11940.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The interaction of a new class of quinolone antimicrobials (new quinolones) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) with the GABAA receptor-Cl- channel complex was investigated in frog sensory neurones by use of the internal perfusion and 'concentration clamp' techniques. 2. The new quinolones and the NSAIDs (both 10(-6)-10(-5) M) had little effect on the GABA-induced chloride current (ICI) when applied separately. At a concentration of 10(-4) M the new quinolones, and to a lesser degree the NSAIDs, produced some suppression of the GABA response. 3. The co-administration of new quinolones and some NSAIDs (10(-6)-10(-14) M) resulted in a marked suppression of the GABA response. The size of this inhibition was dependent on the concentration of either the new quinolone or the NSAID tested. The inhibitory potency of new quinolones in combination with 4-biphenylacetic acid (BPAA) was in rank order norfloxacin (NFLX) much greater than enoxacin (ENX) greater than ciprofloxancin (CPFX) much greater than ofloxacin (OFLX), and that of NSAIDs in combination with ENX was BPAA much greater than indomethacin = ketoprofen greater than naproxen greater than ibuprofen greater than pranoprofen. Diclofenac, piroxicam and acetaminophen did not affect GABA responses in the presence of ENX. 4. In the presence of ENX or BPAA, there was a small shift to the right of the concentration-response curve for GABA without any effect on the maximum response. However, the co-administration of these drugs suppressed the maximum of the GABA concentration-response curve, indicating a non-competitive inhibition, for which no voltage-dependency was observed.5. Simultaneous administration of ENX and BPAA also suppressed pentobarbitone (PB)-gated Icl. On the other hand, both PB and phenobarbitone reversed the inhibition of GABA-induced Ic, by coadministration of ENX and BPAA.6. The effect on GABAA responses of co-administration of new quinolones and NSAIDs was not via an interaction with benzodiazepine receptors coupled to the GABAA receptor, since this effect was not reversed by Rol5-1788 or diazepam.7.

We have investigated the effects of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on nociception during ischaemia and on reperfusion hyperalgesia in rats. 2. We induced tail ischaemia in conscious rats by applying a tourniquet at the base of the tail until the rats exhibited co-ordinated escape behaviour when we released the tourniquet. 3. We assessed hyperalgesia by measuring the tail flick latency following tail immersion in water at 49 degrees C, before applying and immediately after releasing the tourniquet, and then at 30 min intervals for 2 h. 4. Intraperitoneal injection of NSAIDs prior to applying the tourniquet had no effect on the co-ordinated escape behaviour during ischaemia, nor on tail flick latency in the absence of prior ischaemia. However all the drugs attenuated reperfusion hyperalgesia in a log dose-dependent manner. Doses required to abolish hyperalgesia, were indomethacin 5 mg kg-1, diclofenac sodium 42 mg kg-1, ibuprofen 54 mg kg-1, dipyrone 168 mg kg-1 and paracetamol 170 mg kg-1. 5.

The cytoprotection provided by iloprost was compared with that of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. 2 Treatment of hepatocytes with either NABQI (0.4 mM) or paracetamol (2 mM) alone resulted in a considerable loss of cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion or leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, accompanied by an increase in the percentage of viable cells that were blebbed. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (1.25 mM) pretreatment diminished the loss of cell viability and the percentage of blebbed cells resulting from exposure to NABQI or paracetamol, whereas iloprost (10(-16) M to 10(-10) M) pretreatment reduced only the loss of cell viability, not the percentage of viable cells exhibiting blebbing. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly attenuated the depletion by paracetamol of glutathione and decreased the covalent binding of [14C]-paracetamol to cellular proteins, whereas iloprost was without any such effects. 3 The effects of iloprost and N-acetyl-L-cysteine were also investigated by use of a model of paracetamol toxicity in which it is possible to study the biochemical events leading to cell injury separate from the generation of toxic metabolites. Hamster hepatocytes were incubated with paracetamol (4 mM) for 90 min at 37 degrees C during which metabolism of paracetamol occurs with minimal loss of cell viability. Following washing of cells, to remove paracetamol and its metabolites, there was a progressive loss of viability and increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting blebbing when incubated in buffer alone. Addition of either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (1.25 mM) or iloprost (10 14M to 10 -M), following washing, significantly reduced the expected loss of cell viability. Iloprost at concentrations outside this range was without effect.4. Paracetamol toxicity to isolated hepatocytes could be prevented or delayed by treatment with either N-acetyl-L-cysteine or iloprost, but whereas the former prevented or even reversed plasma membrane blebbing with a resultant reduction in the percentage of viable cells that were blebbed, the prostanoid appeared only to delay the progression from plasma membrane blebbing to loss of viability. Hence, the percentage of viable cells that were ultimately blebbed following exposure to paracetamol was not significantly reduced by addition of iloprost.5. Aspirin or ibuprofen exacerbated the loss of viability induced by prior incubation with paracetamol. Thus, there may be a role for endogenous prostaglandins in protecting hepatocytes from paracetamol toxicity.6. Iloprost is cytoprotective without any effect upon toxin metabolism or detoxication. The mechanism of action of iloprost probably does not involve induction of prostaglandin synthesis or activation of the previously-characterized prostacyclin receptor.",1992,,"Nasseri-Sina P, Fawthrop DJ, Wilson J, Boobis AR, Davies DS.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14268.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The present study was conducted in order to examine the effects of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, TCV-309, and the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, on the acute haemodynamic responses to endotoxin in anaesthetized dogs. 2. Endotoxin (2 mg kg-1, i.v.) induced a severe hypotension by decreasing both total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output. Endotoxin also decreased central venous pressure and increased effective vascular compliance (EVC), indicating a blood pooling in the capacitance vessels. 3. The endotoxin-induced hypotension but not the fall in cardiac output, was markedly attenuated by ibuprofen. Ibuprofen abolished the decrease in TPR and even caused a systemic vasoconstriction. Ibuprofen abolished the increase in EVC. 4. The hypotension caused by endotoxin was attenuated by TCV-309 to a lesser extent than ibuprofen. However, the reduction in cardiac output produced by endotoxin was markedly attenuated by the PAF antagonist. TCV-309 also abolished the increase in EVC. In contrast to ibuprofen, TCV-309 did not affect the decrease in TPR caused by endotoxin. 5. Combined treatment with ibuprofen and TCV-309 markedly attenuated the endotoxin-induced hypotension, but not the fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, when compared with animals treated with ibuprofen alone, treatment with ibuprofen and TCV-309 partly attenuated the endotoxin-induced reduction in cardiac output and systemic vasoconstriction. 6. These data indicate that dilatation of both resistance vessels and capacitance vessels contributes to the endotoxin-induced hypotension. It is suggested that (i) both prostanoids and PAF are involved in dilatation of capacitance vessels, (ii) prostanoids, but not PAF cause dilatation of resistance vessels and(iii) PAF may partly contribute to prostanoid-independent reduction in cardiac output in acute canine experimental endotoxin shock.",1993,,"Yamanaka S, Iwao H, Yukimura T, Kim S, Miura K.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2175868?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Oedema formation in skin is dependent on a synergism between mediators that increase vascular permeability and mediators that enhance local blood flow. Leukocyte accumulation is also enhanced by mediators that increase local blood flow. In this study, we have investigated whether nitric oxide (NO), an important endogenous vasodilator, could modulate oedema formation and leukocyte accumulation in guinea-pig skin. 2. Local administration of the NO synthesis inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), dose-dependently inhibited the oedema formation induced in response to intrademal injection of bradykinin or histamine. L-NAME, but not NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (D-NAME); also inhibited oedema formation in response to i.d. injection of platelet-activating factor (PAF), zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) and in a passive cutaneous anaphylactic (PCA) reaction. 3. N-iminoethyl-L-ornithine (L-NIO) was less effective and about 100 times less potent than L-NAME in inhibiting bradykinin-induced oedema formation. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, had little effect on oedema responses induced by bradykinin, PAF and in a PCA reaction. On the other hand, histamine-induced oedema formation was significantly suppressed by ibuprofen. 4. The inhibition by L-NAME of bradykinin-induced oedema formation was reversed by co-injection of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). 5. L-NAME inhibited 111In-eosinophil and 111In-neutrophil accumulation induced by i.d. injection of ZAP. 111In-eosinophil accumulation induced by PAF and in the PCA reaction was also inhibited by L-NAME but not by D-NAME. 6. Co-injection of SNP or PGE1, reversed the inhibition by L-NAME of ZAP-induced oedema formation and 111In-neutrophil accumulation. SNP, but not PGE1, also reversed the effects of L-NAME on ZAP-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation.7. L-NAME caused a significant decrease in basal cutaneous blood flow when injected alone or with bradykinin. Again, SNP or PGE, reversed the effects of L-NAME suggesting that the inhibitory action of L-NAME on oedema formation and cell accumulation was due to an inhibition of vasodilator tone in the microcirculation.8. Thus, it appears that in guinea-pig skin the inhibition of the production of endogenous NO inhibits both leukocyte accumulation and oedema formation induced by different mediators of inflammation.Since administration of L-NAME also causes a local decrease in basal blood flow, we suggest that this is the mechanism by which it exerts anti-inflammatory effects in this model.",1993,,"Teixeira MM, Williams TJ, Hellewell PG.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1993.tb13994.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Leukotrienes have potent biological effects in vitro and in vivo and are found in tissue and in biological fluids in various pathological conditions including allergic diseases. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent stimulus for eosinophil accumulation and activation and there is much interest in determining its importance in mediating the accumulation of eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation in vivo. In this study, we investigated the effects of a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, ZM 230487, on the accumulation of eosinophils and on local oedema formation in cutaneous inflammation in the guinea-pig. 2. The i.d. injection of increasing concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA) led to a dose-dependent accumulation of 111In-eosinophils but oedema formation was only significant at the top dose of AA tested (3 x 10(-8) mol per site). Co-injection of ZM 230487 with AA inhibited 111In-eosinophil accumulation up to 99% but the small oedema response to AA was only partially inhibited. AA-induced oedema formation was only effectively inhibited when a combination of a PAF antagonist, an antihistamine and ZM 230487 was used. 3. Local administration of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, partially inhibited AA-induced oedema formation suggesting that vasodilator prostaglandins may be released following i.d. injection of AA. AA-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation was also partially inhibited by ibuprofen. 4. PAF-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation was partially suppressed by local administration of ZM 230487. In contrast, LTB4-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation was enhanced by ZM 230487. These data suggest that locally-released leukotrienes may modulate mediator-induced eosinophil accumulation. ZM 230487 had no effect on PAF- or LTB4-induced oedema formation. 5. ZM230487 significantly inhibited the accumulation of 111 In-eosinophils, but did not affect local oedema formation, in a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction.

Thapsigargin stimulated the accumulation of cell-associated platelet-activating factor (PAF) and extracellular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in rat peritoneal macrophages. PAF in the conditioned medium was less than the detectable amount. To obtain further insight into the mechanism of PAF accumulation, the role of PGE2 in PAF accumulation was investigated. 2. When macrophages were incubated in medium containing thapsigargin (30 ng ml(-1), 46.1 nM) and cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin, naproxen or ibuprofen, the PAF content of the cells at 10 min was increased in a concentration-dependent manner in accordance with inhibition of PGE2 production.

In thapsigargin-stimulated macrophages, when PGE2(10(-7) M) was added to the medium, the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor-induced stimulation of PAF accumulation at 10 min was markedly inhibited. 4. The accumulation of PAF induced by thapsigargin alone at 10 min was inhibited by exogenous PGE2 (10(-8) and 10(-7) M), or arachidonic acid (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) in accordance with the increase in PGE2 production. 5. The accumulation of PAF induced by thapsigargin alone or by thapsigargin and indomethacin (10(-6) M) was inhibited by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. 6.

Twenty-one wild-type mice received standard diet.<h4>Key results</h4>Compared with transgenic controls, CHF5074 treatment significantly reduced the area occupied by plaques in cortex (P = 0.003) and hippocampus (P = 0.004). The number of plaques were also reduced by CHF5074 in both cortex (P = 0.022) and hippocampus (P = 0.005). Plaque-associated microglia in CHF5074-treated animals was lower than in transgenic controls in cortex (P = 0.008) and hippocampus (P = 0.002). Ibuprofen treatment significantly reduced microglia area in cortex and hippocampus but not beta-amyloid burden. On the last day of the Morris water maze, transgenic controls performed significantly worse than the non-transgenic animals and the CHF5074-treated transgenic mice, on the swimming path to reach the hidden platform. Ibuprofen-treated animals did not perform significantly better than transgenic controls.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Chronic CHF5074 treatment reduced brain beta-amyloid burden, associated microglia inflammation and attenuated spatial memory deficit in hAPP mice.

This raised the possibility that other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and especially ibuprofen, could also interact with hPEPT1. Here, we have assessed the interactions of ibuprofen with hPEPT1.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>The uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar, [(3)H]Ibuprofen and other radio-labelled compounds were investigated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK)/hPEPT1, MDCK/Mock, LLC-PK(1) or Caco-2 cells. The transepithelial transport of ibuprofen and hPEPT1 substrates was investigated in Caco-2 cell monolayers.<h4>Key results</h4>Ibuprofen concentration dependently inhibited hPEPT1-mediated uptake of Gly-Sar in MDCK/hPEPT1 cells (K(i)(app) = 0.4 mM) but uptake of ibuprofen in Caco-2 cells and MDCK/hPEPT1 cells was not inhibited by hPEPT1 substrates. The maximum uptake rate for Gly-Sar uptake was reduced from 522 pmol·min(-1)·cm(-2) to 181 pmol·min(-1)·cm(-2) and 78 pmol·min(-1)·cm(-2) in the presence of 0.5 mM and 1 mM ibuprofen, respectively. The interaction between ibuprofen and hPEPT1 was thus non-competitive. In LLC-PK1 cells, ibuprofen (1 mM) did not influence the transporter-mediated uptake of glycine or α-methyl-D-glycopyranoside. In Caco-2 cell monolayers the absorptive transport of δ-aminolevulinic acid was reduced by 23% and 48% by ibuprofen (1 and 10 mM), respectively. Likewise the transport of Gly-Sar was reduced by 23% in the presence of ibuprofen (1 mM).<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Ibuprofen is a non-competitive inhibitor of hPEPT1. As ibuprofen reduced the transepithelial transport of δ-aminolevulinic acid, drug-drug interactions between ibuprofen and hPEPT1 drug substrates at their site of absorption are possible if administered together.",2010,,"Omkvist DH, Brodin B, Nielsen CU.",https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01000.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Here, we investigated the use of nanocarriers to improve its pharmacokinetics (PKs) and anti tumour efficacy.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of P-I encapsulated into liposomes and micelles, and its in vitro metabolic stability, were determined in cultures of human colon adenocarcinoma cells. The performance of liposomal P-I was further evaluated in PK studies in mice, and in a model of colon cancer xenografts in nude mice.<h4>Key results</h4>Liposomal P-I and micellar P-I showed significantly enhanced cellular uptake in the colon cancer cells. Liposomal P-I also demonstrated increased cytotoxicity in vitro. Free P-I was metabolized rapidly to ibuprofen in the presence of purified esterases. In contrast, liposomal P-I, and to a lesser extent micellar P-I, was resistant to esterase-mediated hydrolysis. In mice, liposomal P-I partially protected P-I from hydrolysis in the circulation, and improved the biodistribution of intact P-I and its metabolites compared to free P-I. Liposomal P-I was more effective at inhibiting the growth of human colon cancer xenografts in mice, which may be explained on the basis of its improved PK profile compared to free P-I.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Liposome encapsulation of P-I partially protected P-I from esterase-mediated hydrolysis in mice, enhanced the cytotoxicity and bioavailability of P-I and increased its efficacy at inhibiting the growth of human colon cancer xenografts.

We tested the hypotheses that ICCs express cyclooxygenase (COX), and that COX products (prostaglandins), are the cause of spontaneous rhythmic contraction (SRC) of isolated strips of rabbit bladder free of urothelium. SRC was abolished by 10 microM indomethacin and ibuprofen (non-selective COX inhibitors). SRC was concentration-dependently inhibited by selective COX-1 (SC-560 and FR-122047) and COX-2 inhibitors (NS-398 and LM-1685), and by SC-51089, a selective antagonist for the PGE-2 receptor (EP) and ICI-192,605 and SQ-29,548, selective antagonists for thromboxane receptors (TP). The partial agonist/antagonist of the PGF-2alpha receptor (FP), AL-8810, inhibited SRC by approximately 50%. Maximum inhibition was approximately 90% by SC-51089, approximately 80-85% by the COX inhibitors and approximately 70% by TP receptor antagonists. In the presence of ibuprofen to abolish SRC, PGE-2, sulprostone, misoprostol, PGF-2alpha and U-46619 (thromboxane mimetic) caused rhythmic contractions that mimicked SRC. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that c-Kit and vimentin co-localized to interstitial cells surrounding detrusor smooth muscle bundles, indicating the presence of extensive ICCs in rabbit bladder. Co-localization of COX-1 and vimentin, and COX-2 and vimentin by ICCs supports the hypothesis that ICCs were the predominant cell type in rabbit bladder expressing both COX isoforms. These data together suggest that ICCs appear to be an important source of prostaglandins that likely play a role in regulation of SRC.

In order to measure the effect of CBZ-phe-met, one needs a repeat-able, quantitative, easily obtainable standard measurement of the edema formation. In this study, a caliper designed for measuring soft materials was used to evaluate the edema, induced by croton oil on rabbit ears, as well as the effects of CBZ-phe-met.<h4>Methods</h4>The model used in this study was croton-induced inflammation on rabbit ears. A caliper for measuring soft materials (European standard DIN 863 part 3, manufactured by TESA Ltd., Renens, Switzerland) was used to evaluate the edema, which is part of the inflammatory effect. The action of CBZ-phe-met and two other anti-inflammatory agents; hydrocortisone and Na-ibuprofen, were compared.<h4>Results</h4>CBZ-phe-met 1-5% was found to reduce the edema on rabbit ears induced by croton oil by 15 to 93%. 5% CBZ-phe-met was found to be as effective as 5% Na-ibuprofen and 0.1% hydrocortisone.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The caliper for soft materials was found to be suitable for measuring the edema induced by croton-oil, as well as the reducing edema due to anti-inflammatory treatment. It was also found that CBZ-phe-met is a potent topical anti-inflammatory agent in the croton-oil-induced inflammatory model.

To analyse the effect on new blood vessel growth, implants from Biatain Ibu, a polyurethane foam containing ibuprofen, were inserted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of BALB/c mice. Implants from ibuprofen-free polyurethane foam Biatain served as controls (n = 10 per group). Blood vessel growth and the functional vessel density (FVD) as a parameter for microvascularization of implant's border zone were assessed by intravital fluorescence microscopy (IVFM). IVFM was performed on days 3, 7 and 12 after implantation. Direct comparison showed no significant differences in FVD (mm/mm(2)) for the border zone of the ibuprofen-releasing implants versus controls on day 3 (185.49 +/- 4.75 versus 197.17 +/- 5.21) and day 7 (229.60 +/- 8.53 versus 247.99 +/- 5.39).

Also, a significant increase of FVD was detected for the ibuprofen-releasing implants throughout the implantation time of 12 days.

Targeted replacement APOE mice (APOE-TR) have been a useful tool to study the effects of APOE isoforms on brain neurochemistry and activity prior to and during AD. We use newly available APOE knock-in mice (JAX-APOE) to compare phenotypes associated with APOE4 across models. Similar to APOE4-TR mice, JAX-E4 mouse brains showed 27% lower levels of APOE protein compared with JAX-E3 (p < 0.001). We analyzed several neuroinflammatory molecules that have been associated with APOE genotype. SerpinA3 was much higher in APOE4-TR mice to APOE3-TR mice, but this effect was not seen in JAX-APOE mice. There were higher levels of IL-3 in JAX-E4 brains compared with JAX-E3, but other neuroinflammatory markers (IL6, TNFα) were not affected by APOE genotype. In terms of neuronal structure, basal dendritic spine density in the entorhinal cortex was 39% lower in JAX-E4 mice compared with JAX-E3 mice (p < 0.001), again similar to APOE-TR mice. One-week treatment with ibuprofen significantly increased dendritic spine density in the JAX-E4 mice, consistent with our previous finding in APOE-TR mice. Behaviorally, there was no effect of APOE genotype on Barnes Maze learning and memory in 6-month-old JAX-APOE mice. Overall, the experiments performed in JAX-APOE mice validated findings from APOE-TR mice, identifying particularly strong effects of APOE4 genotype on lower APOE protein levels and simplified neuron structure.

Intravenous administration of lipid emulsion (ILE) and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) are popular novel therapeutic strategies.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>Compare outcomes of dogs treated with IVF, ILE, and TPE for NSAID intoxications and evaluate outcome predictors for drug subgroups.<h4>Animals</h4>Four hundred thirty-four dogs with NSAID intoxications (2015-2020).<h4>Methods</h4>Multicenter retrospective study of ibuprofen, carprofen, and naproxen intoxication.

The development of mouse models of amyloid deposition permitted direct tests of the proposal that amyloid-activated microglia could cause neurodegeneration in vivo. Many approaches to manipulating microglial activation have been applied to these mouse models, and are the subject of this review. In general, these results do not support a direct neuricidal action of microglia in mouse amyloid models under any activation state. Some of the manipulations cause both a reduction in pathology and a reduction in microglial activation. However, at least for agents like ibuprofen, this outcome may result from a direct action on amyloid production, and a reduction in the microglial-provoking amyloid deposits, rather than from reduced microglial activation leading to a decline in amyloid deposition. Instead, a surprising number of the experimental manipulations which increase microglial activation lead to enhanced clearance of the amyloid deposits. Both the literature and new data presented here suggest that either classical or alternative activation of microglia can lead to enhanced amyloid clearance. However, a limited number of studies comparing the same treatments in amyloid-depositing vs. tau-depositing mice find the opposite effects. Treatments that benefit amyloid pathology accelerate tau pathology. This observation argues strongly that potential treatments be tested for impact on both amyloid and tau pathology before consideration of testing in humans.",2013,,"Lee DC, Rizer J, Hunt JB, Selenica ML, Gordon MN, Morgan D.",https://doi.org/10.1111/nan.12002,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Two types of MDH have been reported: the first one, which develops to different drugs administered simultaneously and the second type, in which sensitizations develop sequentially. In children, studies which diagnose MDH on the basis of positive allergologic tests to 2 or more chemically different drugs are lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a prospective study evaluating children with histories of MDH by skin tests, patch tests, serum-specific IgE assays, and drug provocation tests.<h4>Results</h4>A MDH was diagnosed in 7 (2.5%) of the 279 children evaluated who completed the study. The responsible drugs were β-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins) in 5 episodes, ibuprofen and anticonvulsants in 3, and erythromycin, fentanyl, methylprednisolone, and cotrimoxazole in 1. Sensitivity to 2 chemically different drugs was diagnosed in 6 children and to 3 drugs in 1 child. Two of the 7 children presented the first type of MDH, whereas 5 displayed the second one.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MDH can occur in children, even to drugs other than antibiotics. It is crucial to evaluate children with histories of MDH using both in vivo and in vitro allergologic tests, including challenges.

Acyl glucuronides have been hypothesized to be reactive metabolites and may be associated with toxicity. Both time- and concentration-dependent glucuronidation and covalent binding of BNX, FLX, and ibuprofen (IBP) were determined by exposing sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes to each NSAID. The levels of glucuronide and covalent protein adduct measured in cells followed the order BNX > FLX > IBP. These results indicate that 1) BNX-glucuronide (G) is more reactive than FLX-G, and 2) IBP-G is the least reactive metabolite, which support previous in vivo studies in rats. The proportional increases of protein adduct formation for BNX, FLX, and IBP as acyl glucuronidation increased also support the hypothesis that part of the covalent binding of all three NSAIDs to hepatic proteins is acyl glucuronide-dependent. Moreover, theses studies confirmed the feasibility of using sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes for studying glucuronidation and covalent binding to hepatocellular proteins. These studies also showed that these in vitro methods can be applied using human tissues for the study of acyl glucuronide reactivity. More BNX-protein adduct was formed in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes than FLX-protein adduct, which not only agreed with its relative toxicity in humans but also was consistent with the in vitro findings using rat hepatocyte cultures.

Although experimental rodents are used in preclinical studies to predict glucuronidation and toxicity of drugs in humans, species differences in glucuronidation and drug-induced toxicity have been reported. Humanized UGT1 mice in which the original Ugt1 locus was disrupted and replaced with the human UGT1 locus (hUGT1 mice) were recently developed. In this study, acyl-glucuronidations of etodolac, diclofenac, and ibuprofen in liver microsomes of hUGT1 mice were examined and compared with those of humans and regular mice. The kinetics of etodolac, diclofenac, and ibuprofen acyl-glucuronidation in hUGT1 mice were almost comparable to those in humans, rather than in mice. We further investigated the hepatotoxicity of ibuprofen in hUGT1 mice and regular mice by measuring serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels. Because ALT levels were increased at 6 hours after dosing in hUGT1 mice and at 24 hours after dosing in regular mice, the onset pattern of ibuprofen-induced liver toxicity in hUGT1 mice was different from that in regular mice. These data suggest that hUGT1 mice can be valuable tools for understanding glucuronidations of drugs and drug-induced toxicity in humans.",2014,,"Kutsuno Y, Itoh T, Tukey RH, Fujiwara R.",https://doi.org/10.1124/dmd.114.057083,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The in vitro to in vivo extrapolation approach used in this work was developed to predict possible drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that may occur after coadministration of pemetrexed and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and it included in vitro assays, risk assessment models, and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. The pemetrexed transport and its inhibition parameters by several NSAIDs were quantified using HEK-PEAK cells expressing organic anion transporter (OAT) 3 or OAT4. The NSAIDs were ranked according to their DDI index, calculated as the ratio of their maximum unbound concentration in plasma over the concentration inhibiting 50% (IC50) of active pemetrexed transport. A PBPK model for ibuprofen, the NSAID with the highest DDI index, was built incorporating active renal secretion in Simcyp Simulator. The bottom-up model for pemetrexed underpredicted the clearance by 2-fold. The model we built using a scaling factor of 5.3 for the maximal uptake rate (Vmax) of OAT3, which estimated using plasma concentration profiles from patients given a 10-minute infusion of 500 mg/m(2) of pemetrexed supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12, recovered the clinical data adequately. The observed/predicted increases in Cmax and the area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC0-inf) of pemetrexed when ibuprofen was coadministered were 1.1 and 1.0, respectively. The coadministration of all other NSAIDs was predicted to have no significant impact on the AUC0-inf based on their DDI indexes.

Here, we studied the metabolism of phospho-NSAIDs by carboxylesterases and assessed the impact of carboxylesterases on the anticancer activity of phospho-NSAIDs in vitro and in vivo. The expression of human liver carboxylesterase (CES1) and intestinal carboxylesterase (CES2) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells resulted in the rapid intracellular hydrolysis of phospho-NSAIDs. Kinetic analysis revealed that CES1 is more active in the hydrolysis of phospho-sulindac, phospho-ibuprofen, phospho-naproxen, phospho-indomethacin, and phospho-tyrosol-indomethacin that possessed a bulky acyl moiety, whereas the phospho-aspirins are preferentially hydrolyzed by CES2. Carboxylesterase expression leads to a significant attenuation of the in vitro cytotoxicity of phospho-NSAIDs, suggesting that the integrity of the drug is critical for anticancer activity. Benzil and bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP), two carboxylesterase inhibitors, abrogated the effect of carboxylesterases and resensitized carboxylesterase-expressing cells to the potent cytotoxic effects of phospho-NSAIDs. In mice, coadministration of phospho-sulindac and BNPP partially protected the former from esterase-mediated hydrolysis, and this combination more effectively inhibited the growth of AGS human gastric xenografts in nude mice (57%) compared with phospho-sulindac alone (28%) (p = 0.037).

We have tested ibuprofen, as well as isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), a NO donor, to learn whether used alone or together they protect dysferlin-null muscle in A/J mice from large strain injury (LSI) induced by a series of high strain lengthening contractions. Mice were maintained on chow containing ibuprofen and ISDN for 4 weeks. They were then subjected to LSI and maintained on the drugs for 3 additional days. We measured loss of torque immediately following injury and at day 3 postinjury, fiber necrosis, and macrophage infiltration at day 3 postinjury, and serum levels of the drugs at the time of euthanasia. Loss of torque immediately after injury was not altered by the drugs. However, the torque on day 3 postinjury significantly decreased as a function of ibuprofen concentration in the serum (range, 0.67-8.2 <i>µ</i>g/ml), independent of ISDN. The effects of ISDN on torque loss at day 3 postinjury were not significant. In long-term studies of dysferlinopathic BlAJ mice, lower doses of ibuprofen had no effects on muscle morphology, but reduced treadmill running by 40%.

In this study, we report that other fenamates, including flufenamic acid, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, and a phenyl acetic acid derivative, diclofenac, also are low-potency (EC(50) = 80 μM to 2.1 mM), partial agonists of human Slo2.1 channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Substituent analysis determined that N-phenylanthranilic acid was the minimal pharmacophore for fenamate activation of Slo2.1 channels. The effects of fenamates were biphasic, with an initial rapid activation phase followed by a slow phase of current inhibition. Ibuprofen, a structurally dissimilar COX inhibitor, did not activate Slo2.1. Preincubation of oocytes with ibuprofen did not significantly alter the effects of NFA, suggesting that neither channel activation nor inhibition is associated with COX activity. A point mutation (A278R) in the pore-lining S6 segment of Slo2.1 increased the sensitivity to activation and reduced the inhibition induced by NFA. Together, our results suggest that fenamates bind to two sites on Slo2.1 channels: an extracellular accessible site to activate and a cytoplasmic accessible site in the pore to inhibit currents.",2012,,"Garg P, Sanguinetti MC.",https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.112.079194,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Prostanoids are derived from arachidonic acid by the sequential actions of phospholipase A(2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and specific prostaglandin (PG) synthases. There are two major COX enzymes, COX1 and COX2, that differ in structure, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and function. COX1 is largely constitutively expressed, whereas COX2 is induced at sites of inflammation and vascular injury. PGI(2) is produced by endothelial cells and influences many cardiovascular processes. PGI(2) acts mainly on the prostacyclin (IP) receptor, but because of receptor homology, PGI(2) analogs such as iloprost may act on other prostanoid receptors with variable affinities. PGI(2)/IP interaction stimulates G protein-coupled increase in cAMP and protein kinase A, resulting in decreased [Ca(2+)](i), and could also cause inhibition of Rho kinase, leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, PGI(2) intracrine signaling may target nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and regulate gene transcription. PGI(2) counteracts the vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregation effects of thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and both prostanoids create an important balance in cardiovascular homeostasis. The PGI(2)/TXA(2) balance is particularly critical in the regulation of maternal and fetal vascular function during pregnancy and in the newborn. A decrease in PGI(2)/TXA(2) ratio in the maternal, fetal, and neonatal circulation may contribute to preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), respectively. On the other hand, increased PGI(2) activity may contribute to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and intraventricular hemorrhage in premature newborns. These observations have raised interest in the use of COX inhibitors and PGI(2) analogs in the management of pregnancy-associated and neonatal vascular disorders. The use of aspirin to decrease TXA(2) synthesis has shown little benefit in preeclampsia, whereas indomethacin and ibuprofen are used effectively to close PDA in the premature newborn. PGI(2) analogs have been used effectively in primary pulmonary hypertension in adults and have shown promise in PPHN. Careful examination of PGI(2) metabolism and the complex interplay with other prostanoids will help design specific modulators of the PGI(2)-dependent pathways for the management of pregnancy-related and neonatal vascular disorders.",2012,,"Majed BH, Khalil RA.",https://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/pharmrev/64/3/540.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We have previously demonstrated that diets enriched in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) effectively reduce pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, in part through metabolic products that suppress microglial-derived tumor necrosis factor-α. To better understand the protective effects of ω-3 PUFAs, we examined the relative importance of major lipid metabolic pathways and their products in contributing to this effect. ω-3 PUFA diets were fed to four lines of mice deficient in each key lipid-processing enzyme (cyclooxygenase 1 or 2, or lipoxygenase 5 or 12/15), retinopathy was induced by oxygen exposure; only loss of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) abrogated the protection against retinopathy of dietary ω-3 PUFAs. This protective effect was due to 5-LOX oxidation of the ω-3 PUFA lipid docosahexaenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDHA). 4-HDHA directly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), independent of 4-HDHA's anti-inflammatory effects. Our study suggests that ω-3 PUFAs may be profitably used as an alternative or supplement to current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for proliferative retinopathy and points to the therapeutic potential of ω-3 PUFAs and metabolites in other diseases of vasoproliferation.

This severe and life-threatening disorder often results in the development of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), which can occur either before or after surgical resection of the affected bowel segment. Using colonic tissue from patients with HSCR alongside the well-established endothelin receptor B knockout mouse model, we investigated epithelial regeneration dynamics and stromal-epithelial cross-talk in the distal ganglionic colon, a critical site for HAEC development. In individuals with HSCR but without epithelial damage, the distal ganglionic colon displayed impaired epithelial regeneration and alteration of intestinal stem cell dynamics, characterized by the reduction of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5<sup>+</sup>) epithelial stem cells. This phenomenon was consistent in the mouse model, where impaired regenerative ability preceded HAEC when epithelial damage occurred on site. Patients with HSCR also exhibited remodeling in stromal cells in this distal ganglionic colon region, with fewer primary sources of Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signal-releasing stromal cells and the exclusive presence of proinflammatory (matrix metalloproteinase 1<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells. Stromal cells from the HSCR distal ganglionic colon failed to sustain the growth of colonic organoids.

Yet, a few previous reports demonstrated an antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen as well, although none investigated its direct effects on the pathogens found in the CF lung, which is the focus of this work. Determination of ibuprofen's <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Burkholderia</i> species strains through measurements of the endpoint number of CFU and growth kinetics showed that ibuprofen reduced the growth rate and bacterial burden of the tested strains in a dose-dependent fashion. In an <i>in vitro</i><i>Pseudomonas</i> biofilm model, a reduction in the rate of biomass accumulation over 8 h of growth with ibuprofen treatment was observed. Next, an acute <i>Pseudomonas</i> pneumonia model was used to test this antimicrobial activity after the oral delivery of ibuprofen. Following intranasal inoculation, ibuprofen-treated mice exhibited lower CFU counts and improved survival compared with the control animals. Preliminary biodistribution studies performed after the delivery of ibuprofen to mice by aerosol demonstrated a rapid accumulation of ibuprofen in serum and minimum retention in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Therefore, ibuprofen-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles (Ibu-NPs) were formulated to improve the pharmacokinetic profile.

Renal secretion and glomerular filtration are the major pathways for the elimination of PAS. We comprehensively studied PAS transport by using cell lines that overexpressed various transporters and found that PAS acts as a novel substrate of an organic anionic polypeptide (OATP1B1), organic cationic transporters (OCT1 and OCT2), and organic anion transporters (OAT1 and OAT3) but is not a substrate of any ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Net PAS uptake was measured, and the transport affinities (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values) for OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 were found to be 50.0, 20.3, 28.7, 78.1, and 100.1 μM, respectively. The net uptake rates suggested that renal OAT1 and OAT3 play relatively major roles in PAS elimination. The representative inhibitors rifampin for OATP1B1, probenecid for OAT1 and OAT3, and verapamil for OCT1 and OCT2 greatly inhibited PAS uptake, suggesting that PAS is dependent on multiple transporters for uptake.

It comprises the activity of styrene monooxygenase, styrene oxide isomerase, and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase, yielding phenylacetic acid as the central metabolite. The alternative route comprises ring-hydroxylating enzymes and yields vinyl catechol as central metabolite, which undergoes <i>meta</i>-cleavage. This was reported to be unspecific and also allows the degradation of benzene derivatives. However, some bacteria had been described to degrade styrene but do not employ one of those routes or only parts of them. Here, we describe a novel ""hybrid"" degradation pathway for styrene located on a plasmid of foreign origin. As putatively also unspecific, it allows metabolizing chemically analogous compounds (e.g., halogenated and/or alkylated styrene derivatives). <i>Gordonia rubripertincta</i> CWB2 was isolated with styrene as the sole source of carbon and energy. It employs an assembled route of the styrene side-chain degradation and isoprene degradation pathways that also funnels into phenylacetic acid as the central metabolite.

MED,38231263,38231263.0,10.1128/aem.01213-23,Wastewater contaminants in a fractured bedrock aquifer and their potential use as enteric virus indicators.,"Domestic wastewater is a source of persistent organic pollutants and pathogens to the aquatic environment, including groundwater aquifers. Wastewater contaminants include a variety of personal care products, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupters, bacteria, and viruses. Groundwater from 22 wells completed in a semi-confined to confined, fractured Silurian dolostone aquifer in southern Wellington County, Ontario, Canada, was analyzed for 14 organic wastewater contaminants (4 artificial sweeteners, 10 pharmaceuticals) as well as <i>E. coli</i>, total coliforms, and 6 human enteric viruses. Enteric viruses were detected in 8.6% of 116 samples, and at least one organic wastewater contaminant was detected in 82% of the wells (in order of decreasing detection frequency: acesulfame, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, carbamazepine, and saccharin). Virus indicator metrics [positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), sensitivity, specificity] were calculated at the sample and well level for the organic wastewater compounds, <i>E. coli</i>, and total coliforms. Fecal bacteria were not good predictors of virus presence (PPV = 0%-8%). Of the potential chemical indicators, triclosan performed the best at the sample level (PPV = 50%, NPV = 100%), and ibuprofen performed the best at the well level (PPV = 60%, NPV = 67%); however, no samples had triclosan or ibuprofen concentrations above their practical quantification limits. Therefore, none of the compounds performed sufficiently well to be considered reliable for assessing the potential threat of enteric viruses in wastewater-impacted groundwater in this bedrock aquifer. Future studies need to evaluate the indicator potential of persistent organic wastewater contaminants in different types of aquifers, especially in fractured rock where heterogeneity is strong.IMPORTANCEAssessing the potential risk that human enteric viruses pose in groundwater aquifers used for potable water supply is complicated by several factors, including: (i) labor-intensive methods for the isolation and quantification of viruses in groundwater, (ii) the temporal variability of these viruses in domestic wastewater, and (iii) their potentially rapid transport in the subsurface, especially in fractured rock aquifers. Therefore, aquifer risk assessment would benefit from the identification of suitable proxy indicators of enteric viruses that are easier to analyze and less variable in wastewater sources. Traditional fecal indicators (e.g., <i>E. coli</i> and coliforms) are generally poor indicators of enteric viruses in groundwater. While many studies have examined the use of pharmaceutical and personal care products as tracers of domestic wastewater and fecal pollution in the environment, there is a paucity of data on the potential use of these chemical tracers as enteric virus indicators, especially in groundwater.",2024,,"Race AS, Spoelstra J, Parker BL.",https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01213-23,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, little research exists on the effect of initial PPCP concentration on PPCP biotransformation or on the microbial communities treating impacted water. In this study, biological PPCP removal at various concentrations was assessed using laboratory columns inoculated with wastewater treatment plant effluent. Pyrosequencing was used to examine microbial communities in the columns and in soil from a soil aquifer treatment (SAT; a method of water treatment prior to reuse) site. Laboratory columns were supplied with different concentrations (0.25, 10, 100, or 1,000 μg liter(-1)) of each of 15 PPCPs. Five PPCPs (4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol [biosol], p-chloro-m-xylenol, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, and phenytoin) were not removed at any tested concentrations. Two PPCPs (naproxen and triclosan) exhibited removals independent of PPCP concentration. PPCP removal efficiencies were dependent on initial concentrations for biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, chlorophene, diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, and valproic acid, showing that PPCP concentration can affect biotransformation. Biofilms from sand samples collected from the 0.25- and 10-μg liter(-1) PPCP columns were pyrosequenced along with SAT soil samples collected on three consecutive days of a wetting and drying cycle to enable comparison of these two communities exposed to PPCPs. SAT communities were similar to column communities in taxonomy and phylotype composition, and both were found to contain close relatives of known PPCP degraders. The efficiency of biological removal of PPCPs was found to be dependent on the concentration at which the contamination occurs for some, but not all, PPCPs.",2014,,"Onesios-Barry KM, Berry D, Proescher JB, Sivakumar IK, Bouwer EJ.",https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03693-13,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

LPS levels rose as early as 1 h after CLP and increased further after 2 and 21 h. TNF-alpha was detectable in serum, spleen, liver, and lungs during the first 4 h, with a peak 2 h after CLP. IL-1 beta was measurable in serum after 24 h, and levels increased significantly in spleen and liver 4 and 8 h after CLP. IL-6 levels increased significantly in serum throughout the first 16 h after CLP. These cytokines were detectable after LPS injection, with kinetics similar to those after CLP but at a significantly higher level. To cast more light on the differences between these two animal models of septic shock, we studied the effects of different reference drugs. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (DEX); ibuprofen (IBU), an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase; and NG-nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, significantly reduced survival, while chlorpromazine (CPZ) and TNF did not affect it. Only the antibiotics and pentoxifylline significantly increased survival in mice with CLP. However, CPZ and DEX protected the mice from LPS mortality. On inhibiting TNF-alpha with DEX, CPZ, or pentoxifylline, survival was reduced, unchanged, and increased, respectively, and on increasing TNF-alpha with IBU and TNF, survival was decreased or unchanged, respectively, suggesting that the modulation of this cytokine does not play a significant role in sepsis induced by CLP, unlike treatment with LPS.

In the anterior hypothalamus and in skeletal muscles leukocytic pyrogen appears to induce the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 which mediates fever and skeletal protein catabolism. It is unclear whether any additional metabolic responses to leukocytic pyrogen result from prostaglandin production. This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of ibuprofen, a specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, to alter protein and trace metal responses to leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin when given in quantities sufficient to block the febrile response. In guinea pigs given continuous infusions of leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin, a 0.6 to 0.8 degrees C fever was observed within 4 h, and zinc and iron concentrations in serum fell by 63 to 78% (P less than 0.01). Rates of whole body amino acid appearance, oxidation, and incorporation into protein were all significantly increased by leukocytic pyrogen and endotoxin treatment, (P less than 0.05) as were the fractional hepatic and seromucoid protein synthesis rates in leukocytic pyrogen-treated animals (P less than 0.01). Muscle protein synthesis was unchanged. Although pretreatment with infusions of ibuprofen completely ablated the febrile response to leukocytic pyrogen and endotoxin, decreases in zinc and iron concentrations in serum and leukocytosis were unaffected. Overall increases in whole body amino acid kinetics induced by leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin were only minimally affected by ibuprofen. We concluded that treatment with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor ibuprofen did not affect whole body trace metal, hematological, or hepatic acute-phase-induced responses to leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin, either because these responses are prostanoid independent or because they are only partially mediated by eicosanoid products.",1983,,"Sobrado J, Moldawer LL, Bistrian BR, Dinarello CA, Blackburn GL.",http://iai.asm.org/cgi/reprint/42/3/997,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is associated with severe consequences, including the abnormal development of the neural system in fetuses and neurological diseases in adults. Therefore, the development of anti-ZIKV drugs is of paramount importance. Screening of generic drugs revealed that several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, and lornoxicam, potently inhibited the entry of Zika virus Env/HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses. They also significantly inhibited the replication of wild-type ZIKV both in cell lines and in primary human fetal endothelial cells. Interestingly, the NSAIDs exerted this inhibitory effect by potently reducing the expression of AXL, the entry cofactor of ZIKV. Further studies showed that the NSAIDs downregulated the prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>/prostaglandin E receptor 2 (EP2)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway and reduced PKA-dependent CDC37 phosphorylation and the interaction between CDC37 and HSP90, which subsequently facilitated CHIP/ubiquitination/proteasome-mediated AXL degradation. Taken together, our results highlight a new mechanism of action of antiviral agents which may assist in designing a convenient strategy for treating ZIKV-infected patients.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, which causes congenital malformations, including microcephaly and other neurological disorders, has attracted global attention. We observed that several NSAIDs significantly inhibited ZIKV infection. Based on our observations, we propose a novel mechanism of action of antiviral compounds which involves the blockade of virus entry via degradation of the entry cofactor. Furthermore, NSAIDs can be practically used for preventing ZIKV infection in pregnant women, as certain NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are considered clinically safe.",2018,,"Pan T, Peng Z, Tan L, Zou F, Zhou N, Liu B, Liang L, Chen C, Liu J, Wu L, Liu G, Peng Z, Liu W, Ma X, Zhang J, Zhu X, Liu T, Li M, Huang X, Tao L, Zhang Y, Zhang H.",https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01018-18,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals.IMPORTANCEElderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.",2025,,"Miller JL, Leedale C, Kang D, Lilue J, Harder OE, Niewiesk S.",https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01863-24,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

After an initial screening visit, patients were withdrawn from their pre-study NSAID and, following a flare of their OA symptoms, were randomised to ibuprofen (2400 mg/day) or placebo. Urinary CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD levels were measured at time of randomisation (baseline) and after 4-6 weeks of treatment.<h4>Results</h4>After 4 to 6 weeks, urinary CTX-II (+17%, p = 0.023) and Glc-Gal-PYD (+10%, p = 0.020) increased significantly from baseline in the placebo group whereas marginal or no increase was observed in the ibuprofen group (CTX-II +2%, NS and Glc-Gal-PYD +4%, p = 0.045). For urinary CTX-II, the difference in the change from baseline between placebo and ibuprofen treated groups was significant (13%, p = 0.017). At baseline, urinary levels of CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD were higher in patients with knee swelling (n = 127) than in those without (n = 74) (p<0.02 for both markers). When patients were stratified according to presence or absence of knee swelling at baseline, the increases over 4-6 weeks of urinary CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD in the placebo group were restricted to patients with knee swelling (+22% from baseline, p = 0.001 and +12%, p = 0.011, for urinary CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD respectively). In patients with knee swelling who were treated with ibuprofen this increase was not observed and the difference from placebo was significant for urinary CTX-II (p = 0.014).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In patients with a flare of knee OA, specifically in patients with evidence of joint inflammation documented by knee swelling, there was a significant increase in markers reflecting cartilage and synovium metabolism that could partly be prevented by high doses of ibuprofen. These data suggest that patients with a flare of knee OA are characterised by increased cartilage and synovial tissue degradation, which may be partly prevented by high doses of NSAIDs.",2004,,"Gineyts E, Mo JA, Ko A, Henriksen DB, Curtis SP, Gertz BJ, Garnero P, Delmas PD.",https://ard.bmj.com/content/annrheumdis/63/7/857.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In both groups additional antibiotic treatment was subsequently prescribed as necessary for persistent, worsening, or recurrent symptoms. The primary endpoints were the number of all courses of antibiotic treatment on days 0-28 (for UTI or other conditions) and burden of symptoms on days 0-7. The symptom score included dysuria, frequency/urgency, and low abdominal pain.<h4>Study answer and limitations</h4>The 248 women in the ibuprofen group received significantly fewer course of antibiotics, had a significantly higher total burden of symptoms, and more had pyelonephritis. Four serious adverse events occurred that lead to hospital referrals; one of these was potentially related to the trial drug. Results have to be interpreted carefully as they might apply to women with mild to moderate symptoms rather than to all those with an uncomplicated UTI.<h4>What this paper adds</h4>Two thirds of women with uncomplicated UTI treated symptomatically with ibuprofen recovered without any antibiotics.

The aim of this study was to validate the use of the high-throughput spot culture growth inhibition (HT-SPOTi) assay for screening libraries of compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to study the inhibitory effect of ibuprofen (IBP) and the other 2-arylpropanoic acids on the growth inhibition of M tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species.<h4>Methods</h4>The HT-SPOTi method was validated not only with known drugs but also with a library of 47 confirmed anti-TB active compounds published in the ChEMBL database. Three over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also included in the screening. The 2-arylpropanoic acids, including IBP, were comprehensively evaluated against phenotypically and physiologically different strains of mycobacteria, and their cytotoxicity was determined against murine RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, a comparative bioinformatic analysis was employed to propose a potential mycobacterial target.<h4>Results</h4>IBP showed antitubercular properties while carprofen was the most potent among the 2-arylpropanoic class. A 3,5-dinitro-IBP derivative was found to be more potent than IBP but equally selective. Other synthetic derivatives of IBP were less active, and the free carboxylic acid of IBP seems to be essential for its anti-TB activity. IBP, carprofen and the 3,5-dinitro-IBP derivative exhibited activity against multidrug-resistant isolates and stationary phase bacilli. On the basis of the human targets of the 2-arylpropanoic analgesics, the protein initiation factor infB (Rv2839c) of M tuberculosis was proposed as a potential molecular target.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The HT-SPOTi method can be employed reliably and reproducibly to screen the antimicrobial potency of different compounds. IBP demonstrated specific antitubercular activity, while carprofen was the most selective agent among the 2-arylpropanoic class. Activity against stationary phase bacilli and multidrug-resistant isolates permits us to speculate a novel mechanism of antimycobacterial action.

Inhibition of the Rho pathway in a central nervous system-effective manner requires higher dosages compared with orthodox cyclooxygenase-blocking effects. Preclinical studies on spinal cord injury (SCI) imply improved motor recovery after ibuprofen/indometacin-mediated Rho inhibition. This has been reassessed by a meta-analysis of the underlying experimental evidence, which indicates an overall effect size of 20.2% regarding motor outcome achieved after ibuprofen/indometacin treatment compared with vehicle controls. In addition, ibuprofen/indometacin may also limit sickness behaviour, non-neurogenic systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), neuropathic pain and heterotopic ossifications after SCI. Consequently, 'small molecule'-mediated Rho inhibition after acute SCI warrants clinical investigation.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Protocol of an investigator-initiated clinical open-label pilot trial on high-dose ibuprofen treatment after acute traumatic, motor-complete SCI. A sample of n=12 patients will be enrolled in two cohorts treated with 2400 mg/day ibuprofen for 4 or 12 weeks, respectively. The primary safety end point is an occurrence of serious adverse events, primarily gastroduodenal bleedings. Secondary end points are pharmacokinetics, feasibility and preliminary effects on neurological recovery, neuropathic pain and heterotopic ossifications. The primary safety analysis is based on the incidence of severe gastrointestinal bleedings. Additional analyses will be mainly descriptive and casuistic.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The clinical trial protocol was approved by the responsible German state Ethics Board, and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, the principles of Good Clinical Practice and all further applicable regulations. This safety and pharmacokinetics trial informs the planning of a subsequent randomised controlled trial.

Drugs used for non-nervous system conditions also showed significant negative association with cognitive score, including those where such an association might have been predicted (antihypertensives, eg, amlodipine b<sub>reasoning</sub> -0.1 (-0.15 to -0.06), b<sub>memory</sub> -0.08 (-0.13 to -0.03), b<sub>reaction time</sub> -3 (-5 to -2); antidiabetics, eg, insulin b<sub>reaction time</sub> -13 (-17 to -10)) and others where such an association was a surprising observation (proton pump inhibitors, eg, omeprazole b<sub>reasoning</sub> -0.11 (-0.15 to -0.06), b<sub>memory</sub> -0.08 (-0.12 to -0.04), b<sub>reaction time</sub> -5 (-6 to -3); laxatives, eg, contact laxatives b<sub>reaction time</sub> -13 (-19 to -8)). Finally, only a few medications and health supplements showed association towards a positive effect on cognitive function (anti-inflammatory agents, eg, ibuprofen b<sub>reasoning</sub> 0.05 (0.02 to 0.08), b<sub>reaction time</sub> 4 (3, 5); glucosamine b<sub>reasoning</sub> 0.09 (0.03 to 0.14), b<sub>reaction time</sub> 5 (3 to 6)).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this large volunteer study, some commonly prescribed medications were associated with poor cognitive performance. Some associations may reflect underlying diseases for which the medications were prescribed, although the analysis controlled for the possible effect of diagnosis. Other drugs, whose association cannot be linked to the effect of any disease, may need vigilance for their implications in clinical practice.",2016,,"Nevado-Holgado AJ, Kim CH, Winchester L, Gallacher J, Lovestone S.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012177,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We aim to investigate benefit and harm of different combinations of paracetamol, ibuprofen and dexamethasone following total hip arthroplasty.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>RECIPE is a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel 4-group, blinded trial with 90-day and 1-year follow-up performed at nine Danish hospitals. Interventions are initiated preoperatively and continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Eligible participants undergoing total hip arthroplasty are randomised to:group A: oral paracetamol 1000 mg × 4+oral ibuprofen 400 mg × 4+intravenous placebo; group B: oral paracetamol 1000 mg × 4+intravenous dexamethasone 24 mg+oral placebo; group C: oral ibuprofen 400 mg × 4+intravenous dexamethasone 24 mg+oral placebo; group D: oral paracetamol 1000 mg × 4+oral ibuprofen 400 mg × 4+intravenous dexamethasone 24 mg.Primary outcome is cumulative opioid consumption at 0-24 hours. Secondary outcomes are pain at rest, during mobilisation and during a 5 m walk and adverse events. Follow-up includes serious adverse events and patient reported outcome measures at 90 days and 1 year. A total of 1060 participants are needed to demonstrate a difference of 8 mg in 24-hour morphine consumption assuming an SD of 24.5 mg, a risk of type I errors of 0.0083 and a risk of type 2 errors of 0.2. Primary analysis will be a modified intention-to-treat analysis.With this trial we aim to verify recommendations for pain treatment after total hip arthroplasty, and investigate the role of dexamethasone as an analgesic adjuvant to paracetamol and ibuprofen.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This trial is approved by the Region Zealand Committee on Health Research Ethics (SJ-799).

As ibuprofen selectively inhibited fatty acid oxidation in the liver or caused mitochondrial damage in intestinal cells, its effect on substrate oxidation by isolated colonocytes of man and rat was examined. Ibuprofen dose dependently (2.0-7.5 mmol/l) and selectively inhibited 14CO2 production from labelled n-butyrate in colonocytes from the proximal and distal human colon (n = 12, p = < 0.001). Glucose oxidation was either unaltered or increased. Because short chain fatty acid oxidation is the main source of acetyl-CoA for long chain fatty acid synthesis, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen in the colonic mucosa could also occur at this level. Because the concentrations of ibuprofen that can be attained in the human colon are not known, conclusions drawn from current dosages are tentative. The inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by ibuprofen may be biochemically implicated in the initiation and exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, manifestation of which would depend on the ibuprofen concentrations reached in the colon.",1995,,"Roediger WE, Millard S.",https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.36.1.55,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pharmacological concentrations of aspirin and ibuprofen (10(-8)-10(-4) M), potentiated histamine (10(-6)-10(-4)M) and forskolin (10(-5)M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion without affecting basal secretion, acetylcholine (10(-6)M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion or cell vitality. Augmentation of secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion was dependent on extracellular calcium because potentiation was abolished by calcium depletion of the medium. Cimetidine inhibited the potentiation effect on histamine but not on forskolin stimulated pepsinogen secretion, thus suggesting that this augmentation was independent of histamine H2 receptors. Of interest, potentiation was also independent of endogenous prostaglandin inhibition because exogenous addition of prostaglandin E2 and D2 increased both basal and acetylcholine stimulated pepsinogen secretion in a dose dependent way, but they did not modify histamine or histamine plus aspirin or ibuprofen stimulated pepsinogen secretion. In conclusion, aspirin and ibuprofen potentiate secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion by dispersed human peptic cells and this might be an additional mechanism of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric injury. This potentiation effect is regulated by calcium, independent of endogenous prostaglandin inhibition and seems to act on pepsinogen secretion at a post-receptor site.",1995,,"Lanas AI, Nerín J, Esteva F, Sáinz R.",https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/36/5/657.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The effect of octreotide on neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium was also evaluated.<h4>Methods</h4>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated either with saline (0.3 ml subcutaneously) or octreotide (0.001-1 ng/kg subcutaneously). After 30 minutes gastric ulcers were induced by the intragastric application of NSAIDs (20 mg/kg indomethacin, 200 mg/kg aspirin, 200 mg/kg ibuprofen, or 50 mg/kg diclofenac). Four hours later the rats were killed and gastric mucosal lesions were assessed by computed planimetry. To determine whether octreotide could prevent indomethacin induced injury in humans, 20 healthy volunteers were evaluated in a double blind, placebo controlled study.<h4>Results</h4>Octreotide prevented NSAID induced gastric mucosal lesions (p < 0.05). The dose response curve was U shaped and the most effective dose was 0.1 ng/kg. Leucocyte adherence in submucosal venules of the stomach was evaluated by in vivo microscopy. Octreotide (0.1 ng/kg subcutaneously) prevented indomethacin (20 mg/kg intragastric) induced leucocyte adherence in gastric submucosal venules (p < 0.05). Healthy human volunteers received 50 mg indomethacin orally thrice a day concomitantly with either an identical placebo or 0.01 microgram, 0.1 microgram, or 1 microgram octreotide subcutaneously thrice a day for three days. Injury was assessed by endoscopy. There was a negative correlation between the octreotide dose and injury score (p < 0.03 for gastric injury, p < 0.001 for duodenal injury).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Octreotide protects the stomach from NSAID induced gastric injury, probably via its ability to reduce NSAID induced neutrophilic adhesion to the microvasculature.

We studied the effects of ibuprofen on gene expression in chondrocytes from patients with OA using RNA-Seq. Chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage samples of patients with OA undergoing knee replacement surgery, cultured with ibuprofen, and total mRNA was sequenced. Differentially expressed genes were identified with edgeR using pairwise comparisons. Functional analysis was performed using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Ibuprofen did not induce statistically significant changes in chondrocyte transcriptome when the cells were cultured in the absence of added cytokines. In inflammatory conditions (when the cells were exposed to the OA-related cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β), 51 genes were upregulated and 42 downregulated by ibuprofen with fold change >1.5 in either direction. The upregulated genes included anti-inflammatory factors and genes associated with cell adhesion, while several mediators of inflammation were among the downregulated genes. IPA analysis revealed ibuprofen having modulating effects on inflammation-related pathways such as integrin, IL-8, ERK/MAPK and cAMP-mediated signalling pathways. In conclusion, the effects of ibuprofen on primary OA chondrocyte transcriptome appear to be neutral in normal conditions, but ibuprofen may shift chondrocyte transcriptome towards anti-inflammatory phenotype in inflammatory environments.",2021,,"Pemmari A, Tuure L, Hämäläinen M, Leppänen T, Moilanen T, Moilanen E.",https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2021-001657,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite its efficacy, few patients receive ibuprofen treatment due to potential renal and gastrointestinal toxicity. The mechanism of ibuprofen efficacy is also unclear. We have previously demonstrated that CF microtubules are slower to reform after depolymerization compared with respective wild-type controls. Slower microtubule dynamics in CF cells are responsible for impaired intracellular transport and are related to inflammatory signaling. Here, it is identified that high-dose ibuprofen treatment in both CF cell models and primary CF nasal epithelial cells restores microtubule reformation rates to wild-type levels, as well as induce extension of microtubules to the cell periphery. Ibuprofen treatment also restores microtubule-dependent intracellular transport monitored by measuring intracellular cholesterol transport. These effects are specific to ibuprofen as other cyclooxygenase inhibitors have no effect on these measures. Effects of ibuprofen are mimicked by stimulation of AMPK and blocked by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. We conclude that high-dose ibuprofen treatment enhances microtubule formation in CF cells likely through an AMPK-related pathway.

Identifying the mechanism of ibuprofen efficacy would aid in the development of new therapies that avoid these adverse events. Previous findings demonstrated that ibuprofen treatment restores the regulation of microtubule dynamics in CF epithelial cells through a 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism. The goal of this study is to define the AMPK pathway that leads to microtubule regulation. Here, it is identified that inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is the key step in mediating the AMPK effect. ACC inhibition with 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA) increases microtubule reformation rates in cultured and primary CF epithelial cells to wild-type (WT) rates. TOFA treatment also restores microtubule-dependent distribution of cholesterol and Rab7-positive organelles, as well as reduces expression of the proinflammatory signaling molecule RhoA to WT levels. ACC activation with citrate replicates these CF phenotypes in WT cells further supporting the role of AMPK signaling through ACC as a key mediator in CF cell signaling. It is concluded that ACC inhibition is the key step in the efficacy of AMPK activation at the cellular level and could represent a novel site of therapeutic intervention to address inflammation in CF.",2019,,"Rymut SM, Lu B, Perez A, Corey DA, Lamb K, Cotton CU, Kelley TJ.",https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajplung.00369.2018,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The current study examines the hypothesis that CH initiates an immune response in the carotid body and that chemoreceptor hyperexcitability is dependent on the expression and action of inflammatory cytokines. CH resulted in a robust invasion of ED1(+) macrophages, which peaked on day 3 of exposure. Gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, was increased >2-fold after 1 day of hypoxia followed by a >2-fold increase in IL-6 on day 3. After 28 days of CH, IL-6 remained elevated >5-fold, whereas expression of other cytokines recovered to normal levels. Cytokine expression was not restricted to immune cells. Studies of cultured type I cells harvested following 1 day of in vivo hypoxia showed elevated transcript levels of inflammatory cytokines. In situ hybridization studies confirmed expression of IL-6 in type I cells and also showed that CH induces IL-6 expression in supporting type II cells. Concurrent treatment of CH rats with anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen or dexamethasone) blocked immune cell invasion and severely reduced CH-induced cytokine expression in carotid body.

Using a targeted lipidomics approach, we investigated circulating lipid mediator responses to resistance exercise and treatment with the NSAID ibuprofen. Human subjects undertook a single bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise (80% of one repetition maximum) following oral ingestion of ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo control. Venous blood was collected during early recovery (0-3 h and 24 h postexercise), and serum lipid mediator composition was analyzed by LC-MS-based targeted lipidomics. Postexercise recovery was characterized by elevated levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and 2-derived prostanoids (TXB2, PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, and PGI2), lipooxygenase (5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX)-derived hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and leukotrienes (e.g., LTB4), and epoxygenase (CYP)-derived epoxy/dihydroxy eicosatrienoic acids (EpETrEs/DiHETrEs). Additionally, we detected elevated levels of bioactive lipid mediators with anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties, including arachidonic acid-derived lipoxins (LXA4 and LXB4), and the EPA (E-series) and DHA (D-series)-derived resolvins (RvD1 and RvE1), and protectins (PD1 isomer 10S, 17S-diHDoHE). Ibuprofen treatment blocked exercise-induced increases in COX-1 and COX-2-derived prostanoids but also resulted in off-target reductions in leukotriene biosynthesis, and a diminished proresolving lipid mediator response. CYP pathway product metabolism was also altered by ibuprofen treatment, as indicated by elevated postexercise serum 5,6-DiHETrE and 8,9-DiHETrE only in those receiving ibuprofen.

To investigate the mechanism of this adaptation, muscle biopsies obtained before and ∼72 h after the last training bout were analyzed for mRNA levels of prostaglandin (PG)/cyclooxygenase pathway enzymes and receptors [arachidonic acid synthesis: cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and secreted phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)); PGF(2α) synthesis: PGF(2α) synthase and PGE(2) to PGF(2α) reductase; PGE(2) synthesis: PGE(2) synthase-1, -2, and -3; PGF(2α) receptor and PGE(2) receptor-4], cytokines and myokines involved in skeletal muscle adaptation (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), and regulators of muscle growth [myogenin, myogenic regulatory factor-4 (MRF4), myostatin] and atrophy [Forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A), atrogin-1, muscle RING finger protein 1 (MuRF-1), inhibitory κB kinase β (IKKβ)].

These results highlight prostaglandin and myokine involvement in the adaptive response to exercise in older individuals and suggest two mechanisms underlying the enhanced muscle mass gains in the drug groups: 1) The drug-induced PGF(2α) receptor upregulation helped offset the drug suppression of PGF(2α)-stimulated protein synthesis after each exercise bout and enhanced skeletal muscle sensitivity to this stimulation. 2) The drug-induced suppression of intramuscular PGE(2) production increased net muscle protein balance after each exercise bout through a reduction in PGE(2)-induced IL-6 and MuRF-1, both promoters of muscle loss.",2013,,"Trappe TA, Standley RA, Jemiolo B, Carroll CC, Trappe SW.",https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00245.2012,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This report examines the role of EP receptors in mediating the effects of PGE2 on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell growth. The results indicate that activation of Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 by PGE2 results in increased growth, while EP1 activation is growth inhibitory. Indeed, two EP1 antagonists (ONO-8711 and SC51089) stimulate, rather than inhibit, MDCK cell growth, an effect that is lost following an EP1 knockdown. Similar observations were made with M1 collecting duct and rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells. ONO-8711 even stimulates growth in the absence of exogenous PGE2, an effect that is prevented by ibuprofen (indicating a dependence upon endogenous PGE2). The involvement of Akt was indicated by the observation that 1) ONO-8711 and SC51089 increase Akt phosphorylation, and 2) MK2206, an Akt inhibitor, prevents the increased growth caused by ONO-8711. The involvement of the EGF receptor (EGFR) was indicated by 1) the increased phosphorylation of the EGFR caused by SC51089 and 2) the loss of the growth-stimulatory effect of ONO-8711 and SC51089 caused by the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478. The growth-stimulatory effect of ONO-8711 was lost following an EGFR knockdown, and transduction of MDCK cells with a dominant negative EGFR.

However, the mechanisms mediating this hyperemic response remain unknown. The cyclooxygenase pathway is active in skeletal muscle, is heat sensitive, and contributes to cutaneous thermal hyperemia in young healthy humans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that cyclooxygenase inhibition would attenuate blood flow in the vastus lateralis muscle during localized heating. Twelve participants (6 women) were studied on two separate occasions: <i>1</i>) time control (i.e., no ibuprofen); and <i>2</i>) ingestion of 800 mg ibuprofen, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Experiments were randomized, counter-balanced, and separated by at least 10 days. Pulsed short-wave diathermy was used to induce unilateral deep heating of the vastus lateralis for 90 min, whereas the contralateral leg served as a thermoneutral control. Microdialysis was utilized to bypass the cutaneous circulation and directly measure local blood flow in the vastus lateralis muscle of each leg via the ethanol washout technique. Heat exposure increased muscle temperature and local blood flow (both <i>P</i> < 0.01 vs. baseline). However, the thermal hyperemic response did not differ between control and ibuprofen conditions (<i>P</i> ≥ 0.2). Muscle temperature slightly decreased for the thermoneutral leg (<i>P</i> < 0.01 vs. baseline), yet local blood flow remained relatively unchanged across time for control and ibuprofen conditions (both <i>P</i> ≥ 0.7). Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of cyclooxygenase-derived vasodilator prostanoids does not blunt thermal hyperemia in skeletal muscle of young healthy humans.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Acute heat exposure increases skeletal muscle blood flow in humans.

Using a pharmacological approach combined with microdialysis, we found that thermal hyperemia in the vastus lateralis muscle was well maintained despite the successful inhibition of cyclooxygenase.

Several in vitro studies suggest that cyclooxygenase-inhibiting drugs can alter tendon metabolism and may influence adaptations to resistance training. Thirty-six individuals were randomly assigned to a placebo (67 ± 2 yr old), acetaminophen (64 ± 1 yr old; 4,000 mg/day), or ibuprofen (64 ± 1 yr old; 1,200 mg/day) group in a double-blind manner and completed 12 wk of knee extensor resistance training. Before and after training in vivo patellar tendon properties were assessed with MRI [cross-sectional area (CSA) and signal intensity] and ultrasonography of patellar tendon deformation coupled with force measurements to obtain stiffness, modulus, stress, and strain. Mean patellar tendon CSA was unchanged (P > 0.05) with training in the placebo group, and this response was not influenced with ibuprofen consumption. Mean tendon CSA increased with training in the acetaminophen group (3%, P < 0.05), primarily due to increases in the mid (7%, P < 0.05) and distal (8%, P < 0.05) tendon regions. Correspondingly, tendon signal intensity increased with training in the acetaminophen group at the mid (13%, P < 0.05) and distal (15%, P = 0.07) regions. When normalized to pretraining force levels, patellar tendon deformation and strain decreased 11% (P < 0.05) and stiffness, modulus, and stress were unchanged (P > 0.05) with training in the placebo group. These responses were generally uninfluenced by ibuprofen consumption. In the acetaminophen group, tendon deformation and strain increased 20% (P < 0.05) and stiffness (-17%, P < 0.05) and modulus (-20%, P < 0.05) decreased with training. These data suggest that 3 mo of knee extensor resistance training in older adults induces modest changes in the mechanical properties of the patellar tendon. Over-the-counter doses of acetaminophen, but not ibuprofen, have a strong influence on tendon mechanical and material property adaptations to resistance training. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that acetaminophen has profound effects on peripheral tissues in humans.",2011,,"Carroll CC, Dickinson JM, LeMoine JK, Haus JM, Weinheimer EM, Hollon CJ, Aagaard P, Magnusson SP, Trappe TA.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3154687,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Conversely, certain profound congenital cardiac malformations require the DA to be patent until corrective surgery can be performed. In each instance, clinicians have a very limited repertoire of therapeutic options at their disposal - indomethacin or ibuprofen to close a patent DA (PDA) and prostaglandin E1 to maintain patency of the DA. Neither treatment is specific to the DA and both may have deleterious off-target effects. Therefore, more therapeutic options specifically targeted to the DA should be considered. We hypothesized the DA possesses a unique genetic signature that would set it apart from other vessels. A microarray was used to compare the genetic profiles of the murine DA and ascending aorta (AO). Over 4,000 genes were differentially expressed between these vessels including a subset of ion channel-related genes. Specifically, the alpha and beta subunits of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels are enriched in the DA. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed inhibition of BKCa channels caused the DA to constrict, while activation caused DA relaxation even in the presence of O2. This study identifies subsets of genes that are enriched in the DA that may be used to develop DA-specific drugs. Ion channels that regulate DA tone, including BKCa channels, are promising targets. Specifically, BKCa channel agonists like NS1619 maintain DA patency even in the presence of O2 and may be clinically useful.",2014,,"Shelton EL, Ector G, Galindo CL, Hooper CW, Brown N, Wilkerson I, Pfaltzgraff ER, Paria BC, Cotton RB, Stoller JZ, Reese J.",https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00171.2013,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Investigations help to rule out secondary causes. The role of new drugs in treatment of migraine is discussed and trials are quoted from literature. Indications for starting prophylaxis should be evaluated based on frequency of attacks and influence on quality of life. For management of acute attacks of migraine both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are recommended for use in children. Many drugs like antiepileptic drugs (AED), calcium channel blockers, and antidepressants have been used for prophylaxis of migraine in children.

Here we describe our current work investigating how the serotonergic network in the brain is disrupted in a rodent model of preterm hypoxia-ischemia. One week after postnatal day 3 hypoxia-ischemia, losses of serotonergic raphé neurons, reductions in serotonin levels in the brain, and reduced serotonin transporter expression are evident. These changes can be prevented using two anti-inflammatory interventions; the postinsult administration of minocycline or ibuprofen. However, each drug has its own limitations and benefits for use in neonates to stem damage to the serotonergic network after hypoxia-ischemia.

Methods. Ibuprofen loaded SMEDDS (ISMEDDS) was developed and was characterized. The permeability behavior of Ibuprofen over three different concentrations (20, 30, and 40 µg/mL) was studied in each isolated region of rat intestine by SPIP method at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The human intestinal permeability was predicted using the Lawrence compartment absorption and transit (CAT) model since effective permeability coefficients (P eff) values for rat are highly correlated with those of human, and comparative intestinal permeability of Ibuprofen was carried out with plain drug suspension (PDS) and marketed formulation (MF). Results. The developed ISMEDDS was stable, emulsified upon mild agitation with 44.4 nm ± 2.13 and 98.86% ± 1.21 as globule size and drug content, respectively. Higher P eff in colon with no significant P eff difference in jejunum, duodenum, and ileum was observed.

After the patient was stabilized, in addition to the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) overdose Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia were diagnosed. We report this case to illustrate that the initial presentation of meningitis may be extremely unusual especially in the setting of NSAID overdose and the acutely decompensating patient.

Therefore, acupuncture has been used as an alternative therapy to relieve the symptoms of PD. In clinical practice, a penetrating method of acupuncture with long needle has been shown to be particularly effective for improving primary dysmenorrhea. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique for pain relief in patients with primary dysmenorrhea as compared with a conventional pain medication.<h4>Methods</h4>The present study is a perspective, randomized, ibuprofen-controlled trial. Sixty-two eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either acupuncture treatment or ibuprofen administration. The treatment lasted for three menstrual cycles for both groups. The primary outcome was the intensity of menstrual pain measured by using the visual analogue scale at the completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes included the severity of symptoms associated with menstrual pain, responder rate, and safety of acupuncture treatment. The clinical outcomes were measured on each menstrual cycle at baseline, treatment course (3 cycles), and follow-up period.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-four patients of primary dysmenorrhea were recruited, and 62 subjects were included in the final analysis.

Formulation 8 (F8) of tropical fruit juice mixture was chosen for this present study due to its high phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. Forty Wistar male rats were divided into five groups: dPBS (sham-operated control), dA<i>β</i> (A<i>β</i> control), JPBS (F8 and PBS), JA<i>β</i> (F8 and A<i>β</i>), and IBFA<i>β</i> (ibuprofen and A<i>β</i>). F8 (5 ml/kg BW), and ibuprofen (10 ml/kg BW) was given orally daily for four weeks before the intracerebroventricular infusion of A<i>β</i> for two weeks. Histological analysis and neuronal count of hippocampus tissue in the Cornu Ammonis (CA1) region showed that supplementation with F8 was able to prevent A<i>β</i>-induced tissue damage and neuronal shrinkage. However, no significant difference in locomotor activity and novel object recognition (NOR) percentage was detected among different groups at day 7 and day 14 following A<i>β</i> infusion. Only effect of time differences (main effect of day) was observed at day 7 as compared to day 14, where reduction in locomotor activity and NOR percentage was observed in all groups, with F (1, 7) = 6.940, <i>p</i> < 0.05 and F (1, 7) = 7.152, <i>p</i> < 0.05, respectively. Besides, the MDA level of the JA<i>β</i> group was significantly lower (<i>p</i> < 0.01) than that of the dPBS group. However, no significant changes in SOD activity were detected among different groups. Significant reduction in plasma CRH level (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and iNOS expression (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in the brain was detected in the JA<i>β</i> group as compared to the dA<i>β</i> group.

The products from stingless bee breeding include bee honey and bee propolis. The objective of this experiment is to study the possibility of developing stingless bee propolis wax into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) by the comparison of five surfactants (Brij 721, Cremophor WO 7, Myrj 52, Poloxamer 188, and Tween 80). Each surfactant is used at three concentrations: 10%, 20%, and 30%. A master formula is selected according to the following: physical features, particle size, zeta potential, and entrapment. The results showed that Brij 721 and Myri 52 at 20% can be used in preparing SLN and have good preservation properties for vitamin E (size: 451.2 nm and 416.8 nm, zeta potential: - 24.0 and - 32.7; % EE: 92.32% and 92.00%, resp.). Therefore, they are further developed by adding the following drugs at low solubility: curcumin, ibuprofen, and astaxanthin. It is found that a formula using the surfactants Brij 721 and Myrj 52 at 20% have similar drug entrapment. The entrapment study involves curcumin 82%, ibuprofen 40%, and astaxanthin 67%.

It is almost always present after orthognathic surgeries (OGS), but its severity is subjective in each patient. Postoperative care of the patient is aimed at minimizing of postoperative pain relief orofacial region. Options of physiotherapy include extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) and high-energy light-emitting diode (LED). <i>Aim of the Study</i>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapy combining ELF EMF and LED to reduce pain of the orofacial region in patients after OGS. <i>Material and Methods</i>. The study was conducted in thirty-two patients who underwent OGS to treat morphological defects. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: Physiotherapy group (PT) and Control group (CG). In both groups, patients were prescribed Paracetamol and nonsteroidal analgesics (NSAID-ibuprofen). Patients from the PT group additionally received postoperative physiotherapy immediately after leaving the surgical clinic in the form of ELF EMF and LED therapy. Physiotherapeutic treatments were performed for 10 days, three applications a day, at no cost to the patient. Pain intensity was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a reliable instrument for the measurement of pain intensity self-reported by the patient.<h4>Results</h4>Faster reduction of pain was the major observation made in patients who received physiotherapy treatments. In all subjects, after 5 days of therapy, the pain intensity was reduced by about 50% or resolved completely. Effects of therapy were measured with the relative changes in the pain intensity score, showing what fraction of the initial pain was eliminated at the first stage and throughout the whole therapy. The analysis of relative changes instead of absolute changes allowed us, among other things, to eliminate the bias of the higher initial pain intensity in the CG group compared to the PT group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The conducted research revealed that the combined use of ELF EMF and LED is beneficial in the reduction of pain of patients after OGS. The analgesic effects of physiotherapy in the treatment after OGS are necessary to continue research in this area and analyze the possibility of extending the indications for its use in other surgically treated maxillofacial diseases.",2022,,"Lietz-Kijak D, Ardan R.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/prm/2022/3115154.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

ASDs containing various ratios of IBP and selected polymer were prepared by the melt fusion (MF) method. ASD containing optimized drug-polymer ratio prepared by freeze-drying (FD) method was characterized and compared physicochemically. The solubility of IBP in water increased 28-fold and 35-fold when formulated as ASD by MF and FD, respectively. Precise formulations showed amorphization of IBP and increased surface area, improving solubility. The dissolution pattern of optimized ASD-IBP in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer after 60 min in MF and FD was enhanced 3-fold. In addition, direct compression tablets comprising optimized ASD granules from MF and FD were made and assessed using compendial and noncompendial methods. ASD-IBP/MF and ASD-IBP/FD formulations showed a similar drug release profile. In addition, 12 h of sustained IBP release from the ASD-IBP-containing tablets was obtained in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6.8. From the dissolution kinetics analysis, the Weibull model fitted well. The drug release pattern indicated minimal variations between tablets formed using ASD-IBP prepared by both procedures; however, pre- and postcompression assessment parameters differed.

Angiogenesis was measured by in vitro endothelial cell tube formation and immunohistochemistry.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen significantly inhibited cell proliferation in mouse (MC-26) and human (HT-29) colorectal cancer cell lines. In vitro angiogenesis assays also indicated that ibuprofen decreased both cell proliferation and tube formation. The administration of chow containing 1,360 ppm ibuprofen, which achieved an average plasma concentration of ibuprofen lower than the peak level achieved in humans at therapeutic doses, inhibited tumor growth by 40% to 82%.

Previously, we showed that treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen induced p75(NTR) expression in several prostate cancer cell lines leading to p75(NTR)-mediated decreased survival. Using the 2-phenyl propionic acid moiety of these profens as a pharmacophore, we screened an in silico database of 30 million compounds and identified carprofen as having an order of magnitude greater activity for induction of p75(NTR) levels and inhibition of cell survival. Prostate (PC-3 and DU-145) and bladder (T24) cancer cells were more sensitive to carprofen induction of p75(NTR)-associated loss of survival than breast (MCF-7) and fibroblast (3T3) cells. Transfection of prostate cell lines with a dominant-negative form of p75(NTR) before carprofen treatment partially rescued cell survival, showing a cause-and-effect relationship between carprofen induction of p75(NTR) levels and inhibition of survival. Carprofen induced apoptotic nuclear fragmentation in prostate but not in MCF-7 and 3T3 cells. Furthermore, small interfering RNA knockdown of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein prevented induction of p75(NTR) by carprofen in both prostate cell lines. Carprofen treatment induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as early as within 1 min. Expression of a dominant-negative form of MK2, the kinase downstream of p38 MAPK frequently associated with signaling cascades leading to apoptosis, prevented carprofen induction of the p75(NTR) protein.

The biologic outcome of signaling through a network is inherently more robust and resistant to inhibition of a single network component. In this study, we conducted a functional chemical genetic screen to identify novel interactions between signaling inhibitors that would not be predicted on the basis of our current understanding of signaling networks. We screened over 300 drug combinations in nine melanoma cell lines and have identified pairs of compounds that show synergistic cytotoxicity. The synergistic cytotoxicities identified did not correlate with the known RAS and BRAF mutational status of the melanoma cell lines. Among the most robust results was synergy between sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with activity against RAF, and diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Drug substitution experiments using the NSAIDs celecoxib and ibuprofen or the MAP-ERK kinase inhibitor PD325901 and the RAF inhibitor RAF265 suggest that inhibition of COX and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling are targets for the synergistic cytotoxicity of sorafenib and diclofenac. Cotreatment with sorafenib and diclofenac interrupts a positive feedback signaling loop involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase, cellular phospholipase A2, and COX.

Although these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often associated with gastrointestinal toxicity, there is renewed interest in their use as colorectal cancer (CRC) chemopreventive agents due to the adverse side effects associated with long-term use of selective COX-2 inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term use (up to 25 years) of NSAIDs (ibuprofen or aspirin) on adenoma pathology and β-catenin-mediated signaling in sporadic human colon adenomas. Although NSAID use did not impact overall adenoma size or degree of dysplasia, it did cause a significant inhibition of nuclear β-catenin localization, which correlated with suppression of cyclin D1 expression. To further elucidate the effect of these agents in regulating β-catenin, we treated SW480 colon cancer cells with a panel of NSAIDs and determined their effects on β-catenin levels and cellular localization. In agreement with our in vivo results, both S-ibuprofen and aspirin were found to decrease total levels of β-catenin while increasing its phosphorylation. In addition, S-ibuprofen induced both degradation of IκBα and nuclear localization of NF-κB. Despite its nuclear localization, however, the activation of the NF-κB target genes, Bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was suppressed. This reduction in NF-κB transcriptional activity may be due to increased phosphorylation of GSK-3β following S-ibuprofen treatment. These data suggest that ibuprofen can effectively target both the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways, and potentially uncovers a novel mechanism through which NSAIDS may exert their chemopreventive efficacy.",2011,,"Greenspan EJ, Madigan JP, Boardman LA, Rosenberg DW.",https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0021,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

There was a marked difference between some formulations in the percentage of applied ibuprofen penetrating the skin samples, with Ibuspray, Ibugel and Ibumousse showing the most efficient penetration. The percentage of applied ibuprofen penetrating the skin samples from these formulations was significantly greater (p < 0.05) at all sampling intervals when compared with Proflex Cream, Fenbid Gel or Deep Relief Gel. By 48 h, the percentage of applied ibuprofen that had penetrated through the skin samples from Ibuspray, Ibugel and Ibumousse was approximately 2.5 times greater than that from Deep Relief Gel, 3 times greater than that from Proflex Cream and 5 times greater than that from Fenbid Gel. The data demonstrate that, with topically applied preparations, the composition of the vehicle can have a significant impact on the percutaneous penetration of the active medicament. The possible reasons for this are discussed in terms of partition and diffusion phenomena.

Ibuleve gel (Dermal Laboratories, UK) contained only ibuprofen whilst Deep Relief gel (Mentholatum, UK) also contained 3% menthol. In contrast to results obtained when these products were compared under in vitro conditions, there was no statistically significant difference in vivo between delivery of ibuprofen. Estimated relative bioavailability fraction (Deep Relief gel/Ibuleve gel) from log-transformed AUC((0-24h)) was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94-1.04), estimated C(max )ratio was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00) and estimated t(max) ratio was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.81-1.20). Menthol produces local vasodilation, which reduces skin barrier function, and these data demonstrate that it is inappropriate to extrapolate from in vitro data where formulation components produce biologically-mediated enhancement of permeation which cannot be modelled ex vivo.

Ibuprofen was administered intravenously at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg at the time of coronary artery occlusion and again 2.5 h later. Ibuprofen significantly prevented the loss of myocardial creatine phosphokinase (CPK) release in ischemic cardiac tissue. In addition, this drug significantly returned S-T segment elevation toward normal values, and significantly prevented the myocardial loss of compounds having free amino nitrogen groups, an index of proteolysis. Although ibuprofen moderated the increased plasma CPK activity, plasma CPK values 5 h after coronary occlusion were above control values. Thus, ibuprofen significantly prevented alterations in three of the four indices used to assess myocardial ischemic damage. The protective mechanism of ibuprofen may be via stabilization of cellular membranes (i.e., lysosomal membranes) and to a lesser extent on reduction in myocardial oxygen demand.",1979,,"Lefer AM, Polansky EW.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000170624,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The bioavailability of drug from commercial gel and emulsion was assessed after the application of various doses (3, 6 and 12 mg/cm2) and an application time of 0.5 h at two time points: 0.5 and 24 h (only with the 12 mg/cm2 dose) after the removal of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) from the skin. In parallel, we assessed the epidermal concentration of the drug in vitro and evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of the topicals in vivo. A correlation (r = 0.9603, p < 0.001) between the amount of drug in the epidermis expressed as micrograms per milligram of epidermal protein and the corresponding inhibition of the inflammation was observed. Increasing the amount of drug in the epidermis correlated with an increased inhibition of the inflammation. The gel formulation released more drug to the skin and produced a greater anti-inflammatory effect. Topical NSAID concentration in treated skin can therefore be determined and correlates well with the resulting pharmacodynamic activity.

Five groups of rabbits were orally administered with 25 mg/kg of IBU nanosuspension, nanoparticles, unhomogenized suspension, marketed product, and untreated suspension. A sixth group received 5 mg/kg IBU intravenously. Blood samples obtained were analyzed by chromatography.<h4>Results</h4>The nanosuspensions showed significant decrease in particle size. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PP) K30 profoundly increased aqueous solubility of IBU. Addition of Tween 80 (TW), in equal amount as PP (IBU:PP:TW, 1:2:2 w/w), resulted in much smaller particle size and better dissolution rate. The Cmax values achieved were 14.8 ± 1.64, 11.1 ± 1.37, 9.01 ± 0.761, 7.03 ± 1.38, and 3.23 ± 1.03 μg/mL, and the tmax values were 36 ± 8.2, 39 ± 8.2, 100 ± 17.3, 112 ± 15, and 105 ± 17 min for the nanosuspension, nanoparticle, unhomogenized suspension, marketed IBU suspension, and untreated IBU suspension in water, respectively. Bioavailability of the different formulations relative to the marketed suspension was found to be in the following sequence: nanosuspension > unhomogenized suspension > nanoparticles > untreated IBU suspension.<h4>Conclusion</h4>IBU/PP/TW nanosuspension showed enhanced in vitro and in vivo performance as compared to the marketed product.

In 45 dogs, heparin did not prevent these flow reductions, but ibuprofen (Motrin) or indomethacin abolished them. With incremental doses of each of these drugs, the cyclical flow reduction and the platelet function in vitro were diminished proportionately. In 10 more dogs, during low flow, pinching or poking the narrowed vessel suddenly restored normal flow. Topical application of papaverine and nitroglycerin proximal to the stenosis did not abolish the cyclic flow reduction, although a transient fall in systemic pressure indicated that they had been absorbed. Seven dogs had the constricting cylinder and flow probe chronically implanted for 4-6 weeks. A single oral dose of aspirin, 20 mg/kg, abolished their cyclic flow reductions for 2-4 days. In five dogs with 70% stenosis in the circumflex coronary artery, coronary arteriography was performed before coronary flow reduction and when coronary blood flow was low. This showed that there was a considerable additional reduction in the size of the mechanically constricted lumen during spontaneous flow reduction. In one dog, a nonopacified mass was dislodged from the area of constriction in 67 msec and this restored the lumen to its control diameter. Similar rapid clearing was filmed in two more dogs. In no case was vasospasm observed.

A glucometer point-of-care measurement revealed a profound hypoglycaemia (1.9 mmol/L). Treatment with intravenous glucose was started and the patient was transported to the hospital. The patient had several episodes of pulseless electrical activity requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance and upon arrival in the hospital. Despite continuous glucose infusion the hypoglycaemia was difficult to correct during the next few hours and the patient developed hypokalaemia. Further investigation to identify the cause of hypoglycaemia revealed that insulin and C-peptide were inappropriately raised. A toxicological investigation revealed the presence of tramadol and its metabolites in lethal concentrations. Also acetaminophen, ibuprofen and lormetazepam were present. Ethanol screening was negative (< 0.1 g/L) and no sulfonylurea were detected. The patient developed multiple organ failure, but eventually recovered.<h4>What happened</h4>The hypoglycaemia was caused by inappropriate stimulation of insulin secretion in a patient intoxicated with tramadol. The sudden hypokalaemia was caused by a massive intracellular shift of potassium in response to the hyperinsulinemia, triggered by the intravenous administration of glucose.<h4>Main lesson</h4>To our knowledge, we are the first to document a significant rise in endogenous insulin production in a hypoglycaemic patient presenting with tramadol intoxication. Our observation suggests that hyperinsulinemia could be the cause of the hypoglycaemia associated with tramadol use.",2020,,"Schiemsky T, Vundelinckx G, Croes K, Penders J, Desmet K, Pauwels S, Vermeersch P.",https://doi.org/10.11613/BM.2020.010802,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Analysis of bradykinin binding site distribution and secretory responses in vitro and in vivo.,"Bradykinin (BK) and lysyl-BK (lys-BK, kallidin) have been proposed as potentially important mediators of rhinorrhea. Possible mechanisms by which BK might contribute to rhinorrhea were investigated by several approaches. (1) The autoradiographic distribution of 125I-BK binding sites in human inferior turbinate nasal mucosa was determined. (2) The effects of BK and lys-BK and antagonists on radiolabeled respiratory glycoconjugate (RGC) release from human nasal mucosa was measured. (3) The secretory effects of BK were studied in cat tracheal mucosa maintained in short-term explant culture, and in ferret trachea maintained in Ussing chambers. (4) The effects of BK on macromolecule secretion in guinea pig nasal mucosa was studied in vivo. Autoradiographic examination of human nasal mucosa revealed that 125I-BK specifically bound to small muscular arteries, venous sinusoids, and submucosal fibers. No specific binding to submucosal glands or goblet cells was noted. Human nasal fragments secreted significantly increased amounts of RGC in response to 10 microM BK (15.0% +/- 1.8 compared with control values; mean +/- standard error of the mean; n = 7; p less than 0.01 by Student's unpaired t test), 10 microM lys-BK (12.2% +/- 3.3; n = 5; p less than 0.05), and 100 microM methacholine (35.7% +/- 2.3; p less than 0.0001).

Saturation kinetics, Na(+)-activation kinetics, and inhibition by ibuprofen were analyzed by monitoring OTC-induced currents as a measure of transport activity. Oxidative stress was induced in ARPE-19 cells and primary RPE cells isolated from wild type and Slc5a8(-/-) mouse retinas using H(2)O(2), and the effects of OTC on cell death and intracellular glutathione concentration were examined.<h4>Results</h4>Heterologous expression of human SLC5A8 in X. laevis oocytes induced Na(+)-dependent inward currents in the presence of OTC under voltage-clamp conditions. The transport of OTC via SLC5A8 was saturable, with a K(t) of 104 ± 3 μM. The Na(+)-activation kinetics was sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 ± 0.1, suggesting involvement of two Na(+) in the activation process. Ibuprofen, a blocker of SLC5A8, inhibited SLC5A8-mediated OTC transport; the concentration necessary for half-maximal inhibition was 17 ± 1 μM. OTC increased glutathione levels and protected ARPE-19 and primary RPE cells isolated from wild type mouse retinas from H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. These effects were abolished in primary RPE isolated from Slc5a8(-/-) mouse retinas.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OTC is a transportable substrate for SLC5A8.

However, neither postictal changes to microvasculature nor Ca2+ changes in key cell types controlling blood perfusion have been visualized in vivo, leaving essential components of the underlying cellular mechanisms unclear. Here, we use 2-photon microvascular and Ca2+ imaging in awake mice to show that seizures result in a robust vasoconstriction of cortical penetrating arterioles, which temporally mirrors the prolonged postictal hypoxia. The vascular effect was dependent on cyclooxygenase 2, as pretreatment with ibuprofen prevented postictal vasoconstriction. Moreover, seizures caused a rapid elevation in astrocyte endfoot Ca2+ that was confined to the seizure period, and vascular smooth muscle cells displayed a significant increase in Ca2+ both during and following seizures, lasting up to 75 minutes. Our data show enduring postictal vasoconstriction and temporal activities of 2 cell types within the neurovascular unit that are associated with seizure-induced hypoperfusion/hypoxia.

Weaning-induced breast involution is implicated, as the collagen-rich, immunosuppressive microenvironment of the involuting mammary gland is tumor promotional in mice. To investigate the role of mammary fibroblasts, isolated mammary PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells from nulliparous and postweaning mice were assessed for activation phenotype and protumorigenic function. Fibroblast activation during involution was evident by increased expression of fibrillar collagens, lysyl oxidase, <i>Tgfb1</i>, and <i>Cxcl12</i> genes. The ability of mammary tumors to grow in an isogenic, orthotopic transplant model was increased when tumor cells were coinjected with involution-derived compared with nulliparous-derived mammary fibroblasts. Mammary tumors in the involution-fibroblast group had increased Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes at the tumor border, and decreased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and tumor cell death.

MED,219025,219025.0,10.1172/jci109241,Effects of osmolality and oxygen availability on soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity of rat renal inner medulla.,"The renal inner medulla is ordinarily exposed to osmolalities that are much higher and to O2 tensions that are lower than those in other tissues. The effects of media osmolality and O2 availability on basal and arginine vasopressin(AVP)-responsive soluble cyclic (c)AMP-dependent protein kinase activity were examined in slices of rat inner medulla. Increasing total media osmolality from 305 to 750 or 1,650 mosM by addition of urea plas NaCl to standard Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer significantly reduced basal cAMP content and protein kinase activity ratios. This occurred in the presence or absence of O2. Incubation of slices in high osmolality buffer also blunted increases in inner medullary slice cAMP and protein kinase activity ratios induced by O2. These changes reflected predominantly an action of the urea rather than the NaCl content of high osmolality buffers. In contrast to effects on basal activity, high media osmolality significantly enhanced activation of inner medullary protein kinase by AVP. Conversely, increases in media O2 content suppressed AVP stimulation of enzyme activity. This inhibitory effect of O2 was best expressed at low osmolality. Naproxen and ibuprofen, inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis, reduced basal kinase activity ratios and increased AVP responsiveness in the presence, but not in the absence, of O2. Exogenous prostaglandins (PG) modestly increased (PGE2 and PGE1) or did not change (PGF2alpha) cAMP and protein kinase activity ratios in O2-deprived inner medullary slices. Protein kinase activation by PGE2 was not observed in oxygenated inner medulla with high basal activity ratios. The stimulatory effects of PGE2 and PGE1 on protein kinase activity observed in O2-deprived slices were additive with those of submaximal or maximal AVP. PGE2, PGE1, and PGF2alpha all failed to suppress AVP activation of protein kinase. Thus, enhanced endogenous PGE production may contribute to the higher basal protein kinase activity ratios induced by O2. However, the results do not support a role for PGE2, PGE1, or PGF2alpha in O2-mediated inhibition of AVP responsiveness. The present data indicate that both solute content and O2 availability can alter the expression of AVP action on cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in inner medulla. AVP activation of protein kinase is best expressed when osmolality is high and O2 availability is low, conditions that pertain in inner medulla during hydropenia.",1978,,"DeRubertis FR, Craven PA.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI109241,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,438338,438338.0,10.1172/jci109365,Corticosteroids inhibit complement-induced granulocyte aggregation. A possible mechanism for their efficacy in shock states.,"Granulocyte (PMN) aggregation and embolization may underlie complement (C)-mediated organ dysfunction in such syndromes as hemodialysis neutropenia and Purtscher's ischem;c retinopathy. Because of clinical and pathologic parallels, we have further suggested a role for this phenomenon in the genesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because corticosteroids are commonly used in immune diseases, and have particularly been claimed efficacious in shock and ARDS, we tested the capability of methylprednisolone (MP), hydrocortisone (HC), and dexamethasone (DEX) to inhibit PMN aggregation. Aggregation engendered in vitro by zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) was inhibited by MP and HC at concentrations approximating plasma levels achieved with the large bolus (30 mg/kg i.v) therapy advocated in shock states; DEX was almost without effect. Using intravital fluorescence microscopy, we observed PMN aggregation and embolization in the mesenteric vessels of rats given intra-arterial infusions of ZAP; this was also prevented by pretreatment with 30 mg/kg MP. Steroid inhibition of aggregation seemed not to involve disruption of receptor function, because aggregation induced by alternative agents, n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and the ionophore A23187, was also inhibited by MP. Moreover, corticosteroid inhibition of PMN prostaglandin synthesis is also an unlikely explanation for our results, since aspirin and ibuprofen failed to block aggregation and arachidonic acid neither effected aggregation itself nor ameliorated the steroid effect. Our studies provide a plausible rationale for the empiric observation that high-dose corticosteroids may benefit patients with syndromes associated with microvascular leukostasis.",1979,,"Hammerschmidt DE, White JG, Craddock PR, Jacob HS.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI109365,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,7107893,7107893.0,10.1172/jci110645,Ibuprofen in canine endotoxin shock.,"The participation of prostaglandins in the physiologic alterations of endotoxin shock has been well established with the aid of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. Our study was designed to investigate the potential of ibuprofen, a highly specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, to reverse the hemodynamic and acid base abnormalities of canine endotoxin shock. Mean blood pressure fell to 49.8 +/- 6.6 mm Hg in dogs given endotoxin by 5 min after injection, and remained below 83 mm Hg for the duration of the 120-min observation period. In animals given endotoxin followed by ibuprofen, a similar initial drop of systemic blood pressure was seen, but it subsequently recovered to 150.2 +/- 4.1 mm Hg by 120 min (P less than 0.001). Cardiac index increased in animals given ibuprofen (2.3 +/- 0.28 liter/m2 per min) compared with animals given endotoxin alone (1.0 +/- 0.09 liter/m2 per min) by termination of the experiment. The arterial pH dropped in endotoxin treated animals to 7.18 +/- 0.03 by 120 min. Ibuprofen prevented the acidosis, the final pH in ibuprofen and endotoxin treated animals measuring 7.36 +/- 0.01. We conclude that ibuprofen protects against the hypotension, acidosis, and depression of cardiac index of canine endotoxin shock.",1982,,"Jacobs ER, Soulsby ME, Bone RC, Wilson FJ, Hiller FC.",https://doi.org/10.1172/jci110645,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,6685136,6685136.0,10.1172/jci111100,Glomerular prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis in rat nephrotoxic serum nephritis. Effects on renal hemodynamics.,"Glomerular arachidonate cyclooxygenation by isolated rat glomeruli was assessed in vitro in antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody-induced glomerulonephritis by radioimmunoassay for prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxane. After a single intravenous injection of rabbit anti-rat GBM serum, we observed enhancement of glomerular thromboxane B2 (TxB2) synthesis as early as 2 to 3 h with smaller increments in PGF2 alpha, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthetic rates. On day 2 of the disease, the glomerular synthesis of TxB2 and, to a lesser extent, PGF2 alpha and PGE2 remained enhanced, whereas on days 8, 11, and 14, TxB2 was the only prostanoid synthesized at increased rates. Glomerular TxB2 synthesis correlated with the presacrifice 24-h protein excretion. 60 min after intravenous infusion of anti-GMB serum, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased (0.66 +/- 0.04 to 0.44 +/- 0.03 ml/min per 100 g, P less than 0.05), without a significant change in renal plasma flow (RPF): 1.97 +/- 0.23 to 1.80 +/- 0.23 ml/min per 100 g) and without a change in glomerular PG synthetic rates. At 2 h, GFR and RPF reached a nadir (0.25 +/- 0.04 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 ml/min per 100 g, respectively) coinciding with a fivefold increment in glomerular TxB2. By 3 h GFR and RPF partially recovered to 0.43 +/- 0.07 and 1.77 +/- 0.20 ml/min per 100 g, respectively, P less than 0.05, despite further increments in TxB2 synthesis. This recovery of GFR and RPF coincided with increments in vasodilatory PG, (PGE2 and PGI2). The thromboxane synthetase inhibitor OKY-1581 markedly inhibited platelet and glomerular TxB2 synthesis and preserved GFR at 1, 2, and 3 h. Another thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, UK-38485, also completely inhibited platelet and glomerular TxB2 synthesis and prevented decrements of GFR at 2 and 3 h. A cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, inhibited platelet TxB2 and PGE2 synthesis and significantly reduced glomerular PGE2 but not TxB2 synthesis. In the ibuprofen-treated rats, the partial recoveries of GFR and RPF at 3 h were attenuated. The in vitro glomerular TxB2 synthesis correlated inversely with the presacrifice GFR and filtration fraction. These observations indicate that in anti-GBM nephritis there is enhanced synthesis of TxA2 and PG in the glomerulus that mediate changes in renal hemodynamics.",1983,,"Lianos EA, Andres GA, Dunn MJ.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI111100,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,3900132,3900132.0,10.1172/jci112053,Functional significance of renal prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 production in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"We have examined the urinary excretion of stable immunoreactive eicosanoids in 23 female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 16 patients with chronic glomerular disease (CGD), and 20 healthy women. SLE patients had significantly higher urinary thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and prostaglandin (PG) E2 excretion and significantly lower 6-keto-PGF1 alpha than did healthy women. In contrast, CGD patients only differed from controls for having reduced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion. The group of SLE patients with active renal lesions differed significantly from the group with inactive lesions for having a lower creatinine clearance and urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and higher urinary TXB2. Higher urinary TXB2 excretion was associated with comparable platelet TXB2 production in whole blood, undetectable TXB2 in peripheral venous blood, and unchanged urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-TXB2. A significant inverse correlation was found between urinary TXB2 and creatinine clearance rate (CCr). In contrast, the urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha showed a significant linear correlation with both CCr and para-aminohippurate clearance rate (CPAH). In four SLE and seven CGD patients, inhibition of renal cyclooxygenase activity by ibuprofen was associated with a significant reduction in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 and in both CCr and CPAH. However, the average decrease in both clearances was 50% lower in SLE patients than in CGD patients, when fractionated by the reduction in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or PGE2 excretion. We conclude that the intrarenal synthesis of PGI2 and TXA2 is specifically altered in SLE.

Disease progression was related to the renal biosynthesis of prostaglandin (PGE2), prostacyclin (6 keto PGF1 alpha), and thromboxane (TXB2) using the MRL-lpr and NZB X NZW F1 hybrid mouse strains with predictably progressive forms of renal disease that mimic the human illness. Mice were evaluated for renal disease by measuring urinary protein excretion and renal immunopathological conditions and these features were related to renal eicosanoid production. These studies show that: (a) intrarenal synthesis of TXB2 increased incrementally in MRL-lpr and NZB X NZW F1 hybrid mice as renal function deteriorated and renal pathologic events progressed; (b) there were no consistent increases in the levels of two other cyclooxygenase metabolites, PGE2 or 6 keto PGF1 alpha; (c) increased TXB2 production occurred in the renal medulla, cortex, and within enriched preparations of cortical glomeruli; (d) when renal disease was prevented by pharmacologic doses of PGE2, intrarenal TXB2 did not increase; (e) administration of a dose of ibuprofen (9 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor capable of reducing 90% of platelet TXB2 without affecting intrarenal levels, did not retard the progression of renal damage. Taken together, these data indicate that the intrarenal level of TXB2 rises in relation to the severity of murine lupus nephritis. Furthermore, because of the potential deleterious effects of TXA2, enhanced production of this eicosanoid may be an important mediator of renal injury.",1986,,"Kelley VE, Sneve S, Musinski S.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI112284,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,3108321,3108321.0,10.1172/jci113020,Aspirin prolongs bleeding time in uremia by a mechanism distinct from platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition.,"We reported that aspirin (ASA) abnormally prolongs bleeding time (BT) in uremia. The present study was designed to investigate whether the abnormally prolonged post-ASA BT in uremia is due to different ASA pharmacokinetics and bioavailability that might be a consequence of uremic condition, platelet cyclooxygenase is peculiarly sensitive to ASA in uremia, and ASA affects primary hemostasis in uremia by a mechanism independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. Our results showed that in patients with uremia, but not in normal subjects, ASA markedly prolongs the BT. This effect is transient and depends on the presence of ASA in the blood. The observed differences in ASA kinetic parameters are not an explanation of the exaggerated effect of ASA on primary hemostasis in uremia. The sensitivity of platelet cyclooxygenase to ASA inhibition is comparable in uremics and in normal subjects. The temporal dissociation between ASA-induced prolongation of BT and the effect on platelet thromboxane A2 generation suggests that ASA inhibits platelet function in uremia by a mechanism distinct from cyclooxygenase blocking. This possibility is strengthened by the observation that ibuprofen at a dose that fully inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase activity does not significantly prolong BT.",1987,,"Gaspari F, Viganò G, Orisio S, Bonati M, Livio M, Remuzzi G.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/113020/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Synergism with tumor necrosis factor and the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition.,"In addition to activating T and B lymphocytes, interleukin 1 (IL-1) induces several hematologic and metabolic changes typical of host responses to infection and injury. We now report a new biological property, namely, the induction of hypotension. Rabbits given a single intravenous injection of recombinant human IL-1-beta (5 micrograms/kg) rapidly developed decreased systemic arterial pressure, which reached the lowest levels after 50-60 min and slowly returned to pre-IL-1 values after 3 h. Associated with the hypotension, systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure fell, while cardiac output and heart rate increased. These responses were prevented by ibuprofen given 15 min before the IL-1. A bolus injection of IL-1 followed by a 2-h infusion sustained the hypotension and was associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Ibuprofen given at the mid-point of the infusion reversed the changes in all hemodynamic parameters, but had no effect on the leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) also induced a shock-like state in rabbits. When the dose of IL-1 or TNF was reduced to 1 microgram/kg, no hemodynamic changes were observed; however, the combination of these low doses of both cytokines resulted in a profound shock-like state including histological evidence of severe pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Pretreatment with ibuprofen prevented the hemodynamic, leukocyte, and platelet changes induced by the low-dose cytokine combination, and ameliorated the pulmonary tissue damage. These results demonstrate that IL-1, like TNF, possesses the ability to induce hemodynamic and hematological changes typical of septic shock, and that the combination of IL-1 and TNF is more potent than either agent alone. These effects seem to require cyclooxygenase products, and suggest that intravenous cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be of therapeutic value in patients with IL-1/TNF-mediated shock.",1988,,"Okusawa S, Gelfand JA, Ikejima T, Connolly RJ, Dinarello CA.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI113431,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Studies were performed in rats 14 d after injection of rabbit serum (n = 6), NTS in the absence (n = 6), or presence, of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (n = 6) or a thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor antagonist, L-670,596 (n = 5). A mesangial macrophage/monocyte infiltrate was noted with equal intensity in all NTS-treated rats. Glomerular generation rates of prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2a, and TxA2 in nephritic kidneys were dramatically increased as compared to controls. 2 wk after NTS, there was an increase in glomerular plasma flow rate (SNPF), attainment of filtration pressure disequilibrium, and augmentation of net transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (delta P). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), however, was reduced, due to a marked fall in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf). Cyclooxygenase inhibition resulted in normalization of glomerular eicosanoid generation rates, amelioration of proteinuria, afferent vasoconstriction, and normalization of SNPF, delta P, Kf, and GFR. Selective antagonism of TxA2 also led to preservation of Kf, but was without effect on SNPF, thereby leading to elevated values for GFR. Thus, in contrast to the pathophysiologic role of arachidonate-lipoxygenase products in the early heterologous phase, PG-mediated vasodilatation and TxA2-induced reductions in Kf and GFR underlie glomerular functional changes during autologous mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.",1990,,"Takahashi K, Schreiner GF, Yamashita K, Christman BW, Blair I, Badr KF.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/114661/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A four- to fivefold increase of type A (p75) and type B (p55) sTNFR was observed 3 h after endotoxin challenge. Pretreatment of the volunteers with ibuprofen before the injection of endotoxin resulted in a slight increase (3.87 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.27 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) and temporal shift of sTNFR-A release concurrent to a marked augmentation of TNF levels (603 +/- 118 vs. 338 +/- 56 pg/ml) as compared to the group without ibuprofen pretreatment. There was a significant correlation between peak sTNFR-A levels and peak TNF levels in the individual probands (r = 0.52, P = 0.04). On the contrary, release kinetics and plasma concentrations of sTNFR-B were identical in both groups (7.38 +/- 0.69 vs. 7.44 +/- 0.33 ng/ml) and no correlation with individual TNF levels was observed. The amount of sTNFR liberated upon endotoxin challenge was not sufficient to block TNF-mediated cytotoxic effects.

Inhibition of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun kinase and upregulation of endothelin B receptors.,"During chronic liver diseases, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) acquire an activated myofibroblast-like phenotype, proliferate, and synthetize fibrosis components. We have shown that endothelin-1 (ET-1) inhibits the proliferation of activated human HSC via endothelin B (ETB) receptors. We now investigate the transduction pathway involved in the growth inhibitory effect of ET-1 in activated HSC. Endothelin-1 and the ETB receptor agonist, sarafotoxin-S6C, increased synthesis of PGI2 and PGE2, leading to elevation of cAMP. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 both blunted the growth inhibitory effect of ET-1. Analysis of early steps associated with growth inhibition indicated that: (a) similar to ET-1, forskolin decreased c-jun mRNA induction without affecting c-fos and krox 24 mRNA expression; (b) ET-1, sarafotoxin-S6C, as well as forskolin, reduced activation of both c-Jun kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Finally, forskolin, PGI2, and PGE2 raised by fivefold the number of ET binding sites after 6 h, and increased the proportion of ETB receptors from 50% in control cells to 80% in treated cells. In conclusion, ET-1 inhibits proliferation of activated HSC via ETB receptors, through a prostaglandin/cAMP pathway that leads to inhibition of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun kinase activities. Upregulation of ETB receptors by prostaglandin/cAMP raises the possibility of a positive feedback loop that would amplify the growth inhibitory response. These results suggest that ET-1 and agents that increase cAMP might be of interest to limit proliferation of activated HSC during chronic liver diseases.",1996,,"Mallat A, Préaux AM, Serradeil-Le Gal C, Raufaste D, Gallois C, Brenner DA, Bradham C, Maclouf J, Iourgenko V, Fouassier L, Dhumeaux D, Mavier P, Lotersztajn S.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI119103,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study, 20 commonly used NSAIDs, dapsone, and enantiomers of flurbiprofen were analyzed for their ability to lower the level of the 42-amino-acid form of amyloid beta protein (Abeta42) in a human H4 cell line. Thirteen of the NSAIDs and the enantiomers of flurbiprofen were then tested in acute dosing studies in amyloid beta protein precursor (APP) transgenic mice, and plasma and brain levels of Abeta and the drug were evaluated. These studies show that (a). eight FDA-approved NSAIDs lower Abeta42 in vivo, (b). the ability of an NSAID to lower Abeta42 levels in cell culture is highly predicative of its in vivo activity, (c). in vivo Abeta42 lowering in mice occurs at drug levels achievable in humans, and (d). there is a significant correlation between Abeta42 lowering and levels of ibuprofen. Importantly, flurbiprofen and its enantiomers selectively lower Abeta42 levels in broken cell gamma-secretase assays, indicating that these compounds directly target the gamma-secretase complex that generates Abeta from APP. Of the compounds tested, meclofenamic acid, racemic flurbiprofen, and the purified R and S enantiomers of flurbiprofen lowered Abeta42 levels to the greatest extent. Because R-flurbiprofen reduces Abeta42 levels by targeting gamma-secretase and has reduced side effects related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), it is an excellent candidate for clinical testing as an Abeta42 lowering agent.",2003,,"Eriksen JL, Sagi SA, Smith TE, Weggen S, Das P, McLendon DC, Ozols VV, Jessing KW, Zavitz KH, Koo EH, Golde TE.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI200318162,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

LPS caused also dose-dependent elevations in urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor 6-keto PGF(1alpha) (PGI-M) and 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) (Tx-M). Platelet COX-1 inhibition by chronic administration of low-dose aspirin before LPS did not alter the symptomatic and febrile responses to LPS, but the increment in urinary PGI-M and Tx-M were both partially depressed. Pretreatment with ibuprofen, a nonspecific COX inhibitor, attenuated the febrile and systemic response to LPS and inhibited prostanoid biosynthesis. Both celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and ibuprofen attenuated the pyrexial, but not the chronotropic, response to LPS. Experimental endotoxemia caused differential expression of the COX isozymes in monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes ex vivo. LPS also increased urinary iPF(2alpha)-III, iPF(2alpha)-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF(2alpha)-VI, isoprostane (iP) indices of lipid peroxidation, and none of the drugs blunted this response. These studies indicate that (a) although COX-2 predominates, both COX isozymes are induced and contribute to the prostaglandin response to LPS in humans; (b) COX activation contributes undetectably to lipid peroxidation induced by LPS; and (c) COX-2, but not COX-1, contributes to the constitutional response to LPS in humans.",2000,,"McAdam BF, Mardini IA, Habib A, Burke A, Lawson JA, Kapoor S, FitzGerald GA.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/9523/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study examines the use of a hair follicle closure technique in vitro, to determine the participation of hair follicles in transdermal drug penetration. Various substances, with different lipophilicities, were tested: caffeine, diclofenac, flufenamic acid, ibuprofen, paracetamol, salicylic acid and testosterone. Diffusion experiments were conducted with porcine skin, the most common replacement material for human skin, in Franz-type diffusion cells over 28 hours. Different experimental settings allowed the differentiation between interfollicular and follicular permeation after topical application of the test compounds. A comparison of the apparent permeability coefficients of the drugs demonstrates that the percutaneous permeations of caffeine and flufenamic acid were significantly higher along the hair follicles. In the cases of paracetamol and testosterone, the follicular pathway appears to be of importance, while no difference was found between interfollicular and follicular permeation for diclofenac, ibuprofen and salicylic acid.

Depending on the formulation, noticeable differences in the permeation of Ibuprofen occurred in vitro (udder skin) and ex vivo (isolated perfused bovine udder), but not in the cellophane membrane. The rates of ibuprofen permeability (cream > gel > microgel) and adsorption into the skin (gel > microgel > cream) varied with the formulation, and were probably caused by differences in the ingredients. Furthermore, different storage conditions and seasonal variation in the collection of the skin samples probably led to differences in the amounts of ibuprofen adsorption apparent in the isolated bovine udder and udder skin.

However, previous studies assessing the relationship between CSD and inflammation have used invasive methods that directly trigger inflammation. To eliminate the injury confounder, we induced CSDs non-invasively through intact skull using optogenetics in Thy1-channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice. We corroborated our findings by minimally invasive KCl-induced CSDs through thinned skull. Six CSDs induced over 1 h dramatically increased cortical <i>interleukin-1β (IL-1β), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2)</i>, and <i>tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)</i> mRNA expression peaking around 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. <i>Interleukin-6 (IL-6)</i> and <i>intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)</i> were only modestly elevated. A single CSD also increased <i>IL-1β, CCL2</i>, and <i>TNF-α</i>, and revealed an ultra-early <i>IL-1β</i> response within 10 min. The response was blunted in IL-1 receptor-1 knockout mice, implicating IL-1β as an upstream mediator, and suppressed by dexamethasone, but not ibuprofen. CSD did not alter systemic inflammatory indices. In summary, this is the first report of pro-inflammatory gene expression after non-invasively induced CSDs.

The effect of diclofenac, piroxicam and (S+)-ibuprofen upon the rat intestine has been measured at constant drug plasma concentrations in the rat, using (51Cr)-EDTA intestinal permeation as a measure of damage. Initially disposition studies after sc administration of the three NSAIDs were carried out. From these studies it was found that constant-rate iv infusions were necessary to maintain plasma concentrations of diclofenac and (S+)-ibuprofen. Administration of piroxicam by sc bolus gave relatively constant plasma concentrations, thus iv infusions were not necessary to obtain concentration-response data for this drug. Relative potency was found by comparing the concentration-response profiles of the three NSAIDs and the rank order of potency obtained was: diclofenac > piroxicam > (S+)-ibuprofen. 2.

Participants underwent a series of three DPT injections at four-week intervals in their symptomatic knee(s) and were immediately prescribed a seven-day course of Ibuprofen after each injection. The main outcome measures included changes in the Knee Injury in Osteoarthritis (KOOS) questionnaire subscales (pain, symptoms, quality of life, sports and recreation function, and activities of daily living) and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS).<h4>Results</h4>There was a statistically significant improvement in the KOOS subscales of pain (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), Symptoms (<i>P</i> = 0.01), and Quality of Life (<i>P</i> = 0.001) after 12 weeks. The KOOS subscales for Sports and Recreation function (<i>P</i> = 0.06) and Activities of Daily Living (<i>P</i> = 0.10) showed numerical improvement over time that fell short of statistical significance.

Current treatment focuses predominantly on restricting dietary consumption of lactose. Given lactose is one of the most commonly used excipients in the pharmaceutical industry, consideration must be given to the lactose content and therefore safety of pharmaceutical preparations prescribed for patients with lactose intolerance. This article summarizes the current literature examining the likelihood of inducing adverse effects through the administration of lactose-containing pharmaceutical preparations in patients reporting lactose intolerance, describes how to assess this risk on an individual patient basis and reviews suitable analgesic options for this population. A case study is presented detailing a patient reporting lactose intolerance who insists on treatment with the lactose-free product codeine/ibuprofen (Nurofen Plus) rather than other codeine-free analgesics. It is important to assess the likelihood of lactose as an excipient inducing symptoms in this scenario, as reluctance to cease codeine could suggest codeine dependence, an issue that is becoming increasingly common in countries such as Australia and Canada. Given codeine dependence is associated with serious sequelae including hospitalization and death, the patient must either be reassured the lactose component in their prescribed analgesics will not induce symptoms or an alternative treatment strategy must be confirmed. General recommendations applying theory from the literature to the management of acute pain in lactose-intolerant patients are discussed and specific treatment options are outlined. Although large inter-individual variability is reported, most lactose-intolerant patients can tolerate the small quantities of lactose found in pharmaceutical preparations. Cumulative lactose exposure can be assessed in patients taking multiple medications while also consuming lactose in the diet. In those sensitive to small quantities of lactose, lactase supplements can be trailed. Additionally, for the analgesic drug classes employed for the management of acute pain, lactose-free formulations, including most oral liquids and dispersible tablets and some oral tablets and capsules, are available.",2018,,"Mill D, Dawson J, Johnson JL.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2042098617751498,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We investigated the expression of MRP4 in human platelets by immunoblotting, detecting a strong signal at 170 kDa. Immunofluorescence microscopy using 2 MRP4-specific antibodies revealed staining mainly in intracellular structures, which largely colocalized with the accumulation of mepacrine as marker for delta-granules and to a lower extent at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, an altered distribution of MRP4 was observed in platelets from a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome with defective delta-granules. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) transport codistributed with MRP4 detection in subcellular fractions, with highest activities in the dense granule and plasma membrane fractions.

Previously we have demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages infiltrating the onplants were associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, in particular by delivering MMP-13 collagenase. By introducing chicken gelatinase B (chMMP-9) as a specific marker for heterophils, we now show that the onset and extent of angiogenesis induced by purified growth factors or by human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells correlated with the initial influx of chMMP-9-positive heterophils. This early heterophil arrival was followed by the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and appeared to sustain further blood vessel formation. The disruption of inflammatory cell influx by 2 mechanistically distinct anti-inflammatory drugs, cortisone and ibuprofen, significantly inhibited angiogenesis, indicating a functional involvement of these inflammatory cells in new blood vessel development. A direct addition of isolated heterophils or purified chMMP-9 into the HT-1080 onplants engrafted into cortisone- or ibuprofen-treated embryos reversed the antiangiogenic effects of the drugs. The exogenously added heterophils induced in vivo a further infiltration of endogenous heterophils and monocytes and dramatically rescued the impaired angiogenesis, highlighting the importance of early inflammatory leukocytes in tumor-induced angiogenesis. Moreover, purified heterophils incorporated into onplants lacking growth factors or tumor cells induced angiogenesis in nontreated embryos, further indicating a direct proangiogenic role for neutrophil-like leukocytes.",2006,,"Zijlstra A, Seandel M, Kupriyanova TA, Partridge JJ, Madsen MA, Hahn-Dantona EA, Quigley JP, Deryugina EI.",https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2005-04-1458,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A systematic literature review found evidence to support efficacy in treating patients with OA for all agents except oxycodone/ibuprofen, which has not been studied in this patient population, although ibuprofen and immediate-release oxycodone have been studied individually for OA pain. Evidence quality was inconsistent, with several agents lacking long-term, controlled trials against active comparators, and functional end points inconsistently met. Although low-dose meloxicam and naproxen plus lansoprazole offer a reduced risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events, cardiovascular and renal risks remain similar to traditional oral NSAID therapy. Further, only lower doses of meloxicam appear to carry a reduced risk of GI events. Diclofenac patch, gel, and solution preparations offer the potential for reduced GI, cardiovascular, and renal adverse events. The level of evidence available to support the efficacy and safety of these agents for long-term treatment of patients with OA differs, with some having only short-term trials, while others have longer-duration trials with active comparators.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By expanding the treatment armamentarium, newly-approved NSAID agents may improve the ability of clinicians to tailor analgesic therapy for their diverse patient populations and to achieve realistic functional improvements.

Due to benefits like a constant plasma level, no pain during application and a simple therapeutic regime, the optimization of formulations for transdermal drug delivery has gained interest in the last decades. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound which is nowadays often used transdermally. The objective of this work was to conduct a study on the effect of different 5% ibuprofen containing formulations (Ibutop® cream, Ibutop® gel, and ibuprofen solution in phosphate buffered saline) on the in vitro-percutaneous permeation of ibuprofen through skin to emphasise the importance of the formulation on percutaneous permeation and skin reservoir.<h4>Methods</h4>The permeation experiments were conducted in Franz-type diffusion cells according to OECD guideline 428 with 2 mg/cm(2) ibuprofen formulation on each skin sample. Ibuprofen was analysed in the receptor fluid and extracted skin samples by UV-VIS high-performance liquid-chromatography at 238 nm. The plot of the cumulative amount of ibuprofen permeated versus time was employed to calculate the apparent permeability coefficient, the maximum flux and the lagtime, all of which were statistically analysed by One-way ANOVA.<h4>Results</h4>Although ibuprofen permeation out of the gel increases rapidly within the first four hours, the cream produced the highest ibuprofen delivery through the skin within 28 hours, followed by the solution and the gel. A significant shorter lagtime was found after gel treatment compared with the cream and the solution.

Fourfold higher ibuprofen reservoirs were found in the solution and gel treated skin samples compared to the cream treated skin samples.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present study demonstrates the importance of the formulation on transdermal drug delivery of ibuprofen and emphasises the differences of drug storage within the skin due to the formulation.

Therefore the design of a randomized, open label, multiple sequence cross-over study with a wash-out period of 7-10 days was used.<h4>Results</h4>AUC(0-t)(last) and AUC(0-infinity) (90%CI) were within the 80 to 125% interval required for bioequivalence as stipulated in the current regulations of the EMEA. Cmax (90%CI) was within the EMEA acceptance range of 75 to 133%. Detailed analyses showed that Cmax of Eudorlin extra was higher than that of Nurofen forte (36.62 vs. 32.92 microg/ml; p = 0.0014) and that of Migränin (35.94 vs. 30.87 microg/ml; p < 0.0001). The time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was shorter with Eudorlin extra than with Nurofen forte (1.14 vs. 1.82 h; p < 0.0001) and Migränin (1.13 vs. 1.78 h; p = 0.0031). Only 1 patient experienced an adverse with possible relation to the study drug taking Migränin.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is concluded that Eudorlin extra is bioequivalent to the two reference preparations Nurofen forte and Migränin for both, the extent and the rate of absorption, after single dose administration in healthy volunteers according to the guidance of the EMEA. Within this frame, peak plasma concentrations are however reached earlier and peaks are higher compared to the reference products. * Eudorlin extra may have different brand names in different countries.",2008,,"Bramlage P, Goldis A.",http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/8/18,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The effect of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen on body temperature in acute stroke: protocol for a phase II double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial [ISRCTN98608690].,"<h4>Background</h4>During the first days after stroke, one to two fifths of the patients develop fever or subfebrile temperatures. Body temperature is a strong prognostic factor after stroke. Pharmacological reduction of temperature in patients with acute ischaemic stroke may improve their functional outcome. Previously, we studied the effect of high dose (6 g daily) and low dose (3 g daily) paracetamol (acetaminophen) in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of 75 patients with acute ischemic stroke. In the high-dose paracetamol group, mean body temperature at 12 and 24 hours after start of treatment was 0.4 degrees C lower than in the placebo group. The effect of ibuprofen, another potent antipyretic drug, on body-core temperature in normothermic patients has not been studied.<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of the present trial is to study the effects of high-dose paracetamol and ibuprofen on body temperature in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, and to study the safety of these treatments.<h4>Design</h4>Seventy-five (3 x 25) patients with acute ischaemic stroke confined to the anterior circulation will be randomised to treatment with either: 400 mg ibuprofen, 1000 mg acetaminophen, or with placebo 6 times daily during 5 days. Body-temperatures will be measured with a rectal electronic thermometer at the start of treatment and after 24 hours. An infrared tympanic thermometer will be used to monitor body temperature at 2-hour intervals during the first 24 hours and at 12-hour intervals thereafter. The primary outcome measure will be rectal temperature at 24 hours after the start of treatment. The study results will be analysed on an intent-to-treat basis, but an on-treatment analysis will also be performed.

Ibuprofen has been shown to have beneficial physiological effects when used as a treatment. However, there are conflicting results with respect to survival. This study aims to investigate the effect of ibuprofen on vital functions, various physiological parameters and survival during endotoxic shock in rabbits.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-eight New Zealand rabbits were randomly separated into four groups. The first group received only saline, the second was given 2 mg/kg intravenous endotoxin at t0, the third received 30 mg/kg ibuprofen 30 minutes after endotoxin administration, whilst the fourth group received ibuprofen 30 minutes before the endotoxin. Respiratory and heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure and rectal temperature were recorded. Complete blood counts were performed and thromboxane B2 was measured every 30 minutes for the first two hours, and then hourly over the course of the experiment. Urine samples were collected at the same time points for the measurement of prostaglandin E2.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen was found to improve respiratory rate, heart rate, and arterial pressure. However, it did not improve the negative effects of endotoxin on body temperature, haematocrit values, white blood cell count, and thrombocyte number. Thromboxane B2 levels in group IV were significantly lower than in the other groups, and the increase started at a later timepoint. In ibuprofen-treated animals, Prostaglandin E2 levels stayed low for at least 90 minutes, but started to rise thereafter. While the average survival in Group II animals was 192.9 +/- 46.9 minutes, those of groups III and IV were 339.1 +/- 33.5 minutes (p < 0.05) and 383.0 +/- 39.6 minutes (p = 0.01), respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen appears to increase survival in endotoxic shock-induced animals.

A possible role of the epithelial sodium channels.,"<h4>Background</h4>Treatment with prostaglandin inhibitors can reduce renal function and impair renal water and sodium excretion. We tested the hypotheses that a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen treatment during fasting decreased renal water and sodium excretion by increased absorption of water and sodium via the aquaporin2 water channels and the epithelial sodium channels.<h4>Methods</h4>The effect of ibuprofen, 600 mg thrice daily, was measured during fasting in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study of 17 healthy humans. The subjects received a standardized diet on day 1, fasted at day 2, and received an IV infusion of 3% NaCl on day 3. The effect variables were urinary excretions of aquaporin2 (u-AQP2), the beta-fraction of the epithelial sodium channel (u-ENaCbeta), cyclic-AMP (u-cAMP), prostaglandin E2 (u-PGE2). Free water clearance (CH2O), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and plasma concentrations of vasopressin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial-, and brain natriuretic peptide.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen decreased u-AQP2, u-PGE2, and FENa at all parts of the study. During the same time, ibuprofen significantly increased u-ENaCbeta. Ibuprofen did not change the response in p-AVP, u-c-AMP, urinary output, and free water clearance during any of these periods. Atrial-and brain natriuretic peptide were higher.<h4>Conclusion</h4>During inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, urinary sodium excretion decreased in parallel with an increase in sodium absorption and increase in u-ENaCbeta. U-AQP2 decreased indicating that water transport via AQP2 fell. The vasopressin-c-AMP-axis did not mediate this effect, but it may be a consequence of the changes in the natriuretic peptide system and/or the angiotensin-aldosterone system<h4>Trial registration</h4>Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT00281762.",2010,,"Lauridsen TG, Vase H, Starklint J, Graffe CC, Bech JN, Nielsen S, Pedersen EB.",http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/11/28/abstract,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is evident that an anti-inflammatory therapy represents an important step in the treatment of CF patients. Corticosteroids and ibuprofen have been proven to slow down the impairment of the pulmonary function in CF patients but their use is limited by the frequency of adverse events. A novel strategy for delivering low doses of steroids for long periods through the infusion of autologous erythrocytes loaded with dexamethasone has been recently set up. A recent study suggested the feasibility of therapy with low doses of corticosteroids delivered through engineered erythrocytes in CF patients. This study presents a further analysis of safety and efficacy of this therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>The treatment group was not randomised and the assignment was based on the patient's consent. Patients entered the study if they had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <70%, puberty development completed, pancreatic insufficiency, and chronic pulmonary infection requiring frequent cycles of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Patients were excluded if they underwent systemic corticosteriod therapy in the three months preceding the experimental treatment or were on therapy with non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NASDs), or if they had liver CF disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or positive tuberculin test. Controls were patients who followed a standard treatment, who fulfilled the enrollment criteria, and who were matched to the experimental group by gender, age, and severity of the disease.<h4>Results</h4>Nine patients in the experimental group received the treatment once a month for a period of 24 month. Patients did not develop diabetes, cataract, or hypertension, or other typical side effects of steroid treatment during the follow up period. There was a constant improvement of FEV1 in patients undergoing the experimental treatment compared to a gradual decrease of the same parameter in the standard therapy group (P = 0.04). The average of clinic and radiological indexes did not vary. The number of infective relapses that have required antibiotic intravenous therapy was not different in the two groups, although the average of these episodes was slightly higher in the experimental therapy group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Intraerythrocyte corticosteroid treatment may stabilize the respiratory function in CF patients but is often considered too invasive by patients. The results obtained by our study may help planning an experimental, controlled, randomised study. A sample size of 150 patients per group would be sufficient for demonstrating such a difference with a 95% confidence interval and a power of 90%.",2006,,"Lucidi V, Tozzi AE, Bella S, Turchetta A.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-6-17,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The relationship between inflammation and cell proliferation due to chronic infection has been studied, but the mechanism is not fully clear. Though the mode of cadmium toxicity is well characterized in animal cells, still it requires some further investigations. Previously we reported that cadmium induces immune cell death in Swiss albino mice. In the present study we showed that instead of inducing cell death mechanism, cadmium in low concentration triggers proliferation in mice lung cell and our results reveals that prior to the induction of proliferation it causes severe inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>Swiss albino mice were treated with different concentrations of cadmium to determine the LD50. Mice were subdivided (5 mice each) according to the exposure period (15, 30, 45, 60 days) and were given sub lethal dose (5 mg/Kg body weight) of cadmium chloride and ibuprofen (50 mg/Kg body weight, recommended dose) once in a week. SEM and histology were performed as evidence of changes in cellular morphology. Inflammation was measured by the expression of Cox-2 and MMPs. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Cox-2, IL-6), signaling and cell cycle regulatory molecules (STAT3, Akt, CyclinD1) were measured by western blot, ELISA and immunoprecipitation. Mutagenecity was evidenced by comet assay. Cell proliferation was determined by cell count, cell cycle and DNA analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Prolonged exposure of low concentration of cadmium resulted in up regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and cell cycle regulatory molecules. Though NSAIDs like Ibuprofen reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, but it did not show any inhibitory effect on cadmium adopted lung cell proliferation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results prove that cadmium causes both inflammation and cell proliferation when applied in a low dose but proliferative changes occur independent of inflammation.",2009,,"Kundu S, Sengupta S, Chatterjee S, Mitra S, Bhattacharyya A.",http://www.biomedcentral.com/1476-9255/6/19,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Total expenditure on NSAIDs has risen by 57% over five years, to 247 pounds sterling million in 2004. We assess whether this expenditure increase can be accounted for by substitution--an increased prescribing of two (more expensive) selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib) and a simultaneous equivalent reduction in the prescribing volume of three (cheaper) older NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen).<h4>Methods</h4>Quarterly prescription data was collated from January 1999 to September 2004. Over this period, the level of correlation between the total prescribing volumes for i) celecoxib and rofecoxib, and ii) diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen were compared, the change in total expenditure on the five NSAIDs was also estimated. The latter was apportioned into that which was estimated to have arisen due to i) substitution, and ii) increased NSAID prescription volume.<h4>Results</h4>Total prescription volumes for the two NSAID groups were negatively correlated (r = -0.97, p < 0.001). In the last quarter there were 1.23 million prescriptions for celecoxib and rofecoxib, and 0.46 million fewer prescriptions for naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen (than in the first quarter, when celecoxib and rofecoxib were not prescribed). Total expenditure for the five NSAIDs was 32.7 pounds sterling million higher in the last quarter, than the first, 12.2 pounds sterling million of which was estimated to be due to substitution, and 20.4 pounds sterling million due to increased volume.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The introduction of celecoxib and rofecoxib was associated with a reduction in the prescription volume for naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen. However, overall quarterly prescription volume for these five NSAIDs increased by 0.76 million, and we estimate that quarterly expenditure increased by 20.4 pounds sterling million more than would have been expected if overall NSAID volume had remained constant. This suggests that the prescription of both celecoxib and rofecoxib may have 'leaked' to population groups who would not previously have received an older NSAID.",2006,,"Barton GR, Avery AJ, Whynes DK.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-7547-4-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pediatricians, prescribing antipyretics for children, rarely encounter significant problems, but the few epidemiologic studies performed show conflicting results. Although it is clear that some patients with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-sensitive asthma have their clinical onset of disease in childhood and bronchoconstriction after ASA challenge is seen in 0 to 22% of asthmatic children so challenged, ibuprofen at antipyretic doses may cause acute respiratory problems only in a very small number of mild to moderate asthmatics. The recently elucidated mechanism of action of acetaminophen may explain some occurrences of adverse reactions in patients with cross-reactive NSAID hypersensitivity on the basis of its inhibitory activity on the newly described enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX)-3. This nonspecific sensitivity to inhibition of COX is most likely genetically determined and shows a remarkable association with atopic disease even in the very young age group and possibly an increased predilection in specific ethnic groups.

Since these phenomena partially mimic the cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) concomitant to Alzheimer's disease, the findings in TGF-beta1 over-expressing mice prompted the hypothesis that CAA could be caused or enhanced by the abnormal production of TGF-beta1. This idea was in accordance with the view that chronic inflammation contributes to Alzheimer's disease, and drew attention to the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of Abeta-elicited CAA. We thus studied the effect of anti-inflammatory drug administration in TGF-beta1-induced pathology. METHODS: Two-month-old TGF-beta1 mice and littermate controls were orally administered pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist, or ibuprofen, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, for two months. Glia activation was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis; Abeta precursor protein (APP) by western blot analysis; Abeta deposition by immunohistochemistry, thioflavin-S staining and ELISA; and hydrocephalus by measurements of ventricle size on autoradiographies of brain sections. Results are expressed as means +/- SD. Data comparisons were carried with the Student's T test when two groups were compared, or ANOVA analysis when more than three groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Animals displayed glia activation, hydrocephalus and a robust thioflavin-S-positive vascular deposition. Unexpectedly, these deposits contained no Abeta or serum amyloid P component, a common constituent of amyloid deposits. The thioflavin-S-positive material thus remains to be identified. Pioglitazone decreased glia activation and basal levels of Abeta42- with no change in APP contents - while it increased hydrocephalus, and had no effect on the thioflavin-S deposits. Ibuprofen mimicked the reduction of glia activation caused by pioglitazone and the lack of effect on the thioflavin-S-labeled deposits. CONCLUSIONS: i) TGF-beta1 over-expressing mice may not be an appropriate model of Abeta-elicited CAA; and ii) pioglitazone has paradoxical effects on TGF-beta1-induced pathology suggesting that anti-inflammatory therapy may reduce the damage resulting from active glia, but not from vascular alterations or hydrocephalus.

These side-effects complicate long term studies of neuropathy or analgesic interventions in animals. We recently demonstrated that pretreatment with sodium bicarbonate (4% NaHCO3) prior to cisplatin (3 mg/kg i.p. weekly up to 5 weeks) was associated with improved health status (i.e. normal weight gain, body temperature, creatinine and ketone levels, and kidney weight ratio) in rats (Neurosci Lett 544:41-46, 2013). To reduce the nephrotoxic effects of cisplatin treatment in mice, we compared effects of sodium bicarbonate (4% NaHCO3 s.c.), vitamin C (25 mg/kg s.c.), resveratrol (25 mg/kg s.c.) and saline (0.9% NaCl) pretreatment on cisplatin-induced changes in animal health status, neuropathic pain and proinflammatory cytokine levels in spinal cord and kidney.<h4>Results</h4>Cisplatin-treated mice receiving saline pretreatment exhibited elevated ketone, creatinine and kidney weight ratios, representative of nephrotoxicity. Vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate lowered creatinine/ketone levels and kidney weight ratio whereas resveratrol normalized creatinine levels and kidney weight ratios similar to saline pretreatment. All pretreatments were associated with decreased ketone levels compared to saline pretreatment. Cisplatin-induced neuropathy (i.e. mechanical and cold allodynia) developed equivalently in all pretreatment groups and was similarly reversed by either morphine (6 mg/kg i.p.) or ibuprofen (6 mg/kg i.p.) treatment. RT-PCR showed that mRNA levels for IL-1β were increased in lumbar spinal cord of cisplatin-treated groups pretreated with either saline, NaHCO3 or resveratrol/cisplatin-treated groups. However, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were elevated in the kidneys in all cisplatin-treated groups. Our studies also demonstrate that 60 days after the last cisplatin treatment, body weight, body temperature, kidney functions and mRNA levels have returned to baseline although the neuropathic pain (mechanical and cold) is maintained.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Studies employing cisplatin should include NaHCO3 or vitamin C pretreatment to improve animal health status and reduce nephrotoxicity (lower creatinine and kidney weight ratio) without affecting the development of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy or analgesic efficacy.",2014,,"Guindon J, Deng L, Fan B, Wager-Miller J, Hohmann AG.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-8069-10-56,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In fact, a relationship between amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and a decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of beta-catenin has been observed. Apparently Abeta binds to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the Frizzled receptor (Fz) inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Cross-talk with other signaling cascades that regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, including the activation of M1 muscarinic receptor and PKC, the use of Ibuprofen-ChE bi-functional compounds, PPAR alpha, gamma agonists, nicotine and some antioxidants, results in neuroprotection against Abeta.

A review of the medical literature revealed this to be, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of this type.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 13-year-old Caucasian girl initially presented to our clinic with hamstring tendinitis. She was commenced on a medication regimen of paracetamol and ibuprofen. After the third ibuprofen dose, she experienced palpitations. These were associated with lower chest and/or upper abdominal discomfort, and a feeling of being hot and sweaty. Her symptoms ceased upon the cessation of ibuprofen therapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Cardiac arrhythmia is a potentially fatal disorder that may exhibit heart palpitations as its initial (or only) symptom. The prompt recognition of the cause of the symptom can reduce mortality and morbidity associated with any underlying pathological processes.

Data were extracted from company clinical trial reports of randomised trials of celecoxib in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis lasting 2 weeks or more. Outcomes were discontinuations (all cause, lack of efficacy, adverse event, gastrointestinal adverse event), endoscopically detected ulcers, gastrointestinal or cardio-renal events, and major changes in haematological parameters. The main comparisons were celecoxib (all doses) versus placebo, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 4,000 mg daily, rofecoxib 25 mg daily, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and loxoprofen). For NSAIDs, celecoxib was compared both at all doses and at licensed doses (200 to 400 mg daily). Thirty-one trials included 39,605 randomised patients. Most patients had osteoarthritis and were women of average age 60 years or above. Most trials lasted 12 weeks or more. Doses of celecoxib were 50 to 800 mg/day. Compared with placebo, celecoxib had fewer discontinuations for any cause or for lack of efficacy, fewer serious adverse events, and less nausea. It had more patients with dyspepsia, diarrhoea, oedema, more adverse events that were gastrointestinal or treatment related, and more patients experiencing an adverse event. There were no differences for hypertension, gastrointestinal tolerability, or discontinuations for adverse events. Compared with paracetamol, celecoxib had fewer discontinuations for any cause, for lack of efficacy, or diarrhoea, but no other differences. Compared with rofecoxib, celecoxib had fewer patients with abdominal pain and oedema, but no other differences.

We investigated its efficacy and mechanism of action in the treatment of breast cancer in preclinical models.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated the anti-breast-cancer efficacy of P-I alone or incorporated into liposomes (Lipo-P-I) in human estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7) and triple-negative, i.e., estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-negative (MDA-MB231) breast cancer cell lines - as they represent the most frequent (estrogen receptor-positive) and the most difficult-to-treat (triple-negative) subtypes of breast cancer - and their xenografts in nude mice. We assessed the effect of P-I on the levels of reactive oxygen nitrogen species in response to P-I using molecular probes, on the thioredoxin system (expression and redox status of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) and thioredoxin reductase activity), on cyclooxygenase 2, NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase cell signaling; and on the growth of xenografts with stably knocked-down Trx-1.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with controls, P-I 400 mg/kg/day inhibited the growth of MDA-MB231 xenografts by 266%, while the growth of MCF-7 xenografts was inhibited 51% byP-I 300 mg/kg/day and 181% by Lipo-P-I 300 mg/kg/day. In both cell lines, P-I induced oxidative stress and suppressed the thioredoxin system (oxidized Trx-1 and decreased its expression; inhibited thioredoxin reductase activity). These changes triggered downstream redox signaling: the activity of NF-κB was suppressed and the Trx-1-ASK1 complex was dissociated, activating the p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Trx-1 knockdown abrogated the anti-cancer effect of P-I in vitro and in vivo.<h4>Conclusion</h4>P-I is safe and effective against breast cancer. Liposomal formulation enhances its efficacy; the effect is heavily dependent on the induction of oxidative stress and the suppression of the thioredoxin system. P-I merits further evaluation as an agent for the treatment of breast cancer.",2012,,"Sun Y, Rowehl LM, Huang L, Mackenzie GG, Vrankova K, Komninou D, Rigas B.",https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/bcr3105,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Here we report a systems biology study that simultaneously describes the transcriptomic and phenotypic stress responses of the model crustacean Daphnia magna after exposure to ibuprofen.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings reveal intriguing similarities in the mode of action of ibuprofen between vertebrates and invertebrates, and they suggest that ibuprofen has a targeted impact on reproduction at the molecular, organismal, and population level in daphnids. Microarray expression and temporal real-time quantitative PCR profiles of key genes suggest early ibuprofen interruption of crustacean eicosanoid metabolism, which appears to disrupt signal transduction affecting juvenile hormone metabolism and oogenesis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Combining molecular and organismal stress responses provides a guide to possible chronic consequences of environmental stress for population health. This could improve current environmental risk assessment by providing an early indication of the need for higher tier testing. Our study demonstrates the advantages of a systems approach to stress ecology, in which Daphnia will probably play a major role.",2008,,"Heckmann LH, Sibly RM, Connon R, Hooper HL, Hutchinson TH, Maund SJ, Hill CJ, Bouetard A, Callaghan A.",http://www.biomedcentral.com/1465-6906/9/R40/abstract,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We have reported increased serum inflammatory cytokines in a rat model of repetitive strain injury (rats perform an upper extremity reaching task for prolonged periods). Here, we sought to determine if sickness behaviors are induced in this model and the effectiveness of conservative treatments.<h4>Methods</h4>Experimental rats underwent initial training to learn a high force reaching task (10 min/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks), with or without ibuprofen treatment (TRHF vs. TRHF + IBU rats). Subsets of trained animals went on to perform a high repetition high force (HRHF) task for 6 or 12 weeks (2 h/day, 3 days/week) without treatment, or received two secondary interventions: ibuprofen (HRHF + IBU) or a move to a lower demand low repetition low force task (HRHF-to-LRLF), beginning in task week 5. Mixed-effects models with repeated measures assays were used to assay duration of social interaction, aggression, forepaw withdrawal thresholds and reach performance abilities. One-way and two-way ANOVAs were used to assay tissue responses. Corrections for multiple comparisons were made.<h4>Results</h4>TRHF + IBU rats did not develop behavioral declines or systemic increases in IL-1beta and IL-6, observed in untreated TRHF rats. Untreated HRHF rats showed social interaction declines, difficulties performing the operant task and forepaw mechanical allodynia. Untreated HRHF rats also had increased serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, neuroinflammatory responses (e.g., increased TNFalpha) in the brain, median nerve and spinal cord, and Substance P and neurokinin 1 immunoexpression in the spinal cord. HRHF + IBU and HRHF-to-LRLF rats showed improved social interaction and reduced inflammatory serum, nerve and brain changes. However, neither secondary treatment rescued HRHF-task induced forepaw allodynia, or completely attenuated task performance declines or spinal cord responses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that inflammatory mechanisms induced by prolonged performance of high physical demand tasks mediate the development of social interaction declines and aggression. However, persistent spinal cord sensitization was associated with persistent behavioral indices of discomfort, despite use of conservative secondary interventions indicating the need for prevention or more effective interventions.",2017,,"Xin DL, Hadrévi J, Elliott ME, Amin M, Harris MY, Barr-Gillespie AE, Barbe MF.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-017-0354-3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The present work showed that the repeated wounding caused the decreases in leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, and root length of Arabidopsis seedlings, while the exATP level was enhanced by the repeated wounding. Repeated application of exogenous ATP had similar effects on the plant growth, as the repeated wounding. Through the comparison of p2k1-3 mutant (in which T-DNA disrupted the gene coding P2K1, as exATP receptor) and wide type (WT) plants, it was found that the mutation in P2K1 decreased the sensitivity of plant growth to the repeated wounding and exogenous ATP application. Further works showed that the ibuprofen (IBU, an inhibitor of jasmonate biosynthesis) partially rescued the wound-induced growth degradation. In comparison, the P2K1 mutation partly rescued the wound-induced growth degradation, whereas this mutation failed to do so in the wounded seedlings treated with IBU, indicating that the role of exATP in regulating the growth degradation by repeated wounding could be linked to the JA signaling pathway.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In conclusion, these results indicate that exATP could be a regulator for the stunted growth of plants by repeated wounding.",2022,,"Shi Z, Wang H, Zhang Y, Jia L, Pang H, Feng H, Wang X.",https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12870-022-03656-z,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ultrasound(US)-guided unilateral single-shot 0.25% ropivacaine L-ESPB was performed in the ESPB group, but not in the control group. Postoperative analgesic strategy for all patients: patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA, diluted and dosed with fentanyl alone) was initiated immediately after surgery combined with oral compound codeine phosphate and ibuprofen sustained release tablets (1 tablet containing ibuprofen 200 mg and codeine 13 mg, 1 tablet/q12h) commenced 6 h postoperatively. We collected and compared patient-centred correlates intraoperatively and 48 h postoperatively. The primary outcomes were intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption and postoperative quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) scores.<h4>Results</h4>Compared to the control group (n = 56), the ESPB group (n = 58) significantly reduced intraoperative remifentanil consumption (estimated median difference - 280 mcg, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 360 to - 200, p < 0.001, power = 100%); significantly reduced fentanyl consumption at 24 h postoperatively (estimated median difference - 80mcg, 95%[CI] - 128 to - 32, p = 0.001, power = 90%); and significantly enhanced the QoR-15 score at 24 h postoperatively (estimated median difference 11, 95%[CI] 8 to 14, p < 0.001, power = 100%). Compared to the control group, the ESPB group enhanced the resting numeric rating scale (NRS) score up to 8 h postoperatively, and the active movement NRS score up to 4 h postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (p = 0.015, power = 70%), abdominal distension (p = 0.024, power = 64%), and muscular calf vein thrombosis (MCVT) (p = 0.033, power = 58%) was lower in the ESPB group than in the control group. Moreover, the occurrence of L-ESPB related adverse reactions was not found herein.<h4>Conclusion</h4>US-guided L-ESPB reduces intraoperative and 24 h postoperative opioid consumption and improves patients' QoR-15 scores at 24 h postoperatively. L-ESPB can be safely and effectively utilized in lumbar UBE surgery.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2200061908 , date of registration: 10/07/2022.

Despite the fact that it has been banned in many high-income countries following confirmed studies of fatal agranulocytosis and adverse drug reactions, it is still widely used in various countries of the world. However, the antipyretic therapeutic indications of dipyrone in febrile children are currently unknown, and there is little information on the advantages and disadvantages of using dipyrone in febrile children. In febrile children, we expected that dipyrone's antipyretic effectiveness wouldn't be any more effective than ibuprofen. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral dipyrone and oral ibuprofen as antipyretics in febrile children.<h4>Methods</h4>Several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, were searched thoroughly using a pre-established search strategy for potential research. The studies included in this analysis comprised randomized controlled trials that compared the antipyretic effects of oral ibuprofen and oral dipyrone in febrile children. Data analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.4 software.<h4>Results</h4>Three studies were selected among the 27 publications we discovered to be applicable, and they underwent qualitative and quantitative analysis. The pooled analysis revealed no discernible difference between oral dipyrone and oral ibuprofen in terms of their antipyretic effects (Mean difference (MD) = 0.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.08, 0.20).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both oral dipyrone and ibuprofen are effective in reducing high-temperature levels in febrile children without any significant difference.",2024,,"Alnajar M, Saker Z, Haji F, Abdelsamed MA, Khaled Z, Abd-ElGawad M.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-024-05095-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Current drugs used to diminish airway inflammation improve the clinical and spirometric status of patients with CF, but their use is limited due to their undesired side effects, for example, glucose intolerance, growth retardation, and cataracts with corticosteroids, gastrointestinal toxicity with ibuprofen, and macrolide resistance with azythromycin. Glycine is known to decrease activation of inflammatory cells, including alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, and is relatively inexpensive, palatable, and virtually devoid of untoward effects. These features make glycine a good candidate for antiinflammatory treatment of CF. Thus, we aimed to explore whether glycine can exert a beneficial effect in a population of patients with CF.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a randomized, double blinded, cross-over pilot clinical trial. Subjects with CF received, in random order, oral glycine (0.5 g/kg/day, dissolved in any liquid) and placebo (glass sugar), each during 8 weeks with an intermediate 2-week wash-out period.<h4>Results</h4>Thirteen subjects aged 6-23 years, 8 females, completed the two arms of the study. As compared with placebo, after glycine intake patients had better symptom questionnaire scores (p = 0.02), mainly regarding sputum features and dyspnea. While spirometric variables tended to decline during placebo intake, they remained stable or even increased during glycine treatment (p = 0.04 to p = 0.003). In this context, FEV<sub>1</sub> declined 8.6% after placebo and increased 9.7% at the end of the glycine period. Pulse oximetry improved after glycine intake (p = 0.04 vs. placebo). TNF-α in serum and IL-6 and G-CSF in sputum tended to decline at the end of the glycine period (p = 0.061, p = 0.068 and p = 0.04, respectively, vs placebo). Glycine was remarkably well tolerated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The clinical, spirometric and inflammatory status of subjects with CF improved after just 8 weeks of glycine intake, suggesting that this amino acid might constitute a novel therapeutic tool for these patients.

The use of local wound infiltration with Ketorolac as an adjuvant pain management strategy is proposed for open trigger finger release surgery. This study aims to compare pain scores and functional outcomes between local wound infiltration with Ketorolac and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Methods</h4>This study is a double-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled trials. Sixty-nine patients underwent trigger finger surgery between December 2021 and October 2022 were randomized into one of three groups: oral Ibuprofen alone group, local Ketorolac alone group and local Ketorolac with oral Ibuprofen group. The assessment included postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, grip strength, mobility of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. and complications.<h4>Results</h4>NRS pain scores during movement of the operated fingers were significantly lower at 6 h in local Ketorolac alone group and local Ketorolac with oral Ibuprofen group compared to oral Ibuprofen alone group. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in postoperative DASH scores, grip strength, mobility of PIP joints, and complications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Local infiltration of Ketorolac as an adjunct in postoperative pain management has been shown to provide superior analgesia during finger movement within the initial 6 h following trigger finger surgery, in comparison to oral NSAIDs.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>Thaiclinicaltrials.org identifier: TCTR20210825002.

Thus, this review aimed to assess the efficacy of analgesics on the relief of pain in orthodontic treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>A computerized literature search was conducted in the databases of EMBASE (via OVID, 1974 to 2019 Week 50), MEDLINE (via OVID, 1946 to Dec 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (December 2019). The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software was applied in the present study. And methodological quality was evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.<h4>Results</h4>We identified twelve publications including 587 patients in 19 randomized controlled trials. The results showed that the mean difference of naproxen in visual analogue scale (VAS) were - 1.45 (95% CI -2.72, - 0.19; P = .02), - 2.11 (95% CI -3.96, - 0.26; P = .03) and - 1.90 (95% CI -3.33, - 0.47; P = .009) in 2 h, 6 h and 24 h respectively. As for ibuprofen, the standard mean differences were - 1.10 (95% CI -1.49, - 0.71), - 1.63(95% CI -2.32, - 0.95) and - 1.34 (95% CI -2.12, - 0.55) at 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h, with the overall P values all < 0.001. The mean difference of acetaminophen is - 0.68, - 1.34, - 1.91 at three time points and the overall P values all < 0.01.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This meta-analysis suggests that the use of analgesics is effective for patients in controlling orthodontic pain. Ibuprofen and naproxen are both of stable analgesic effects which could peak at 6 h, while the analgesic effect of acetaminophen increases steadily from 2 h through 24 h.

A total of 68 patients seeking miniscrew insert placement were recruited based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the ibuprofen group or the control group, with 34 patients in each group. The ibuprofen group and the control group received 300 mg of ibuprofen sustained-release capsules and a placebo, respectively, 30 min before surgery. Postoperative analgesics were administered as needed. Pain scores at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postoperatively were recorded using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and the postoperative analgesic consumption was documented.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 68 patients (34 in the control group and 34 in the preemptive analgesia group) completed the trial. No adverse events such as nausea or vomiting occurred in any of the patients. The preemptive analgesia group exhibited significantly lower pain scores at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h postoperatively [2 (0,3), 0 (0,2), 0 (0,0), 0 (0,0.25), respectively] compared to the control group [3 (2,5), 3 (2,4), 2 (0.75,4), 1 (0,3), respectively] (P = 0.0396, P = 0.0067, P = 0.0111, P = 0.0299).

The prevalence of PD, associated risk factors, and management-seeking practices were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of PD was 80.9%. Most of the females with PD described their menstrual pain as moderate (56%) to severe (34.6%), which significantly affected their daily activities and studying ability (P < 0.001). The major risk factors associated with PD included heavy menstrual flow (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 10.28), family history of PD (AOR = 2.52), history of weight loss attempt (AOR = 2.05), and medical specialization (AOR = 1.663). Only 36.9% of females with PD sought formal medical advice. Most dysmenorrheic females (76.4%) received medications for the management of PD, and remarkably none of them took hormonal contraceptives. Drugs commonly used for PD were mefenamic acid (26.2%), ibuprofen (25%), and paracetamol (11.5%), which were administered when the pain started (58.2%). All medications were significantly effective in reducing the pain score (P = 0.001), and most NSAIDs were more potent than paracetamol in managing PD (P = 0.001). However, no significant difference in adverse effects among medications was revealed. Moreover, no superiority of any individual NSAID for pain relief was established. Nevertheless, mefenamic acid was associated with the lowest risk of abdominal pain (OR: 0.03, P = 0.005) and the highest risk of flank pain (OR = 12, P = 0.02).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Suboptimal management of PD is practiced among university students in Lebanon. Therefore, health care providers should educate dysmenorrheic females to optimize the self-management support of PD. Furthermore, future research is required to investigate females' misconceptions about hormonal contraceptives in the management of PD, aiming to raise awareness and correct misconceptions.",2021,,"Karout S, Soubra L, Rahme D, Karout L, Khojah HMJ, Itani R.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01532-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

(Euphorbiaceae) leaves in experimental rats.,"<h4>Background</h4>The medicinal plants signify a massive basin of potential phytoconstituents that could be valuable as a substitute to allopathic drugs or considered as an analogue in drug development. Phyllanthus niruri L. (Euphorbiaceae) is generally used in traditional medicine to treat ulcer and inflammation. In this project we investigated the methanolic extract of leaves of Phyllanthus niruri for anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer activity.<h4>Methods</h4>The anti-inflammatory activity of methanol extract of Phyllanthus niruri leaves was evaluated at the doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o. while using ibuprofen (20 mg/kg, p.o) as the standard drug. The animals used were Swiss albino rats. Inflammation was induced by injecting 0.1 ml carrageenan (1% w/v) into the left hind paw. Paw tissues from the different groups were examined for inflammatory cell infiltration. On the other hand, antiulcer activity of methanolic extract of P. niruri leaves at the doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o. were examined against ethanol-acid induced gastric mucosal injury in the Swiss albino rats - keeping omeprazole (20 mg/kg, p.o.) as reference. The rats were dissected and the stomachs were macroscopically examined to identify hemorrhagic lesions in the glandular mucosa.<h4>Results</h4>P. niruri significantly (p < 0.01) decreased carrageenan-induced paw edema; it exhibited a reduction of 46.80%, 55.32% and 69.14% at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively. These findings were further supported by the histological study. The methanolic extract also disclosed good protective effect against ethanol-acid induced gastric mucosal injury in the rats. Administration of the extract's doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) demonstrated a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the ethanol- acid induced gastric erosion in all the experimental groups when compared to the control. The methanolic extract at the higher dose (400 mg/kg) resulted in better inhibition of ethanol-acid induced gastric ulcer as compare to omeprazole (20 mg/kg). Histological studies of the gastric wall revealed that toxic control rats revealed mucosal degeneration, ulceration and migration of numerous inflammatory cells throughout the section. On the other hand, MEPN treatment groups showed significant regeneration of mucosal layer and significantly prevented the formation of hemorrhage and edema.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The investigation suggests that methanolic extract of P. niruri leaf possess anti-inflammatory activity and promotes ulcer protection as ascertained by regeneration of mucosal layer and substantial prevention of the formation of hemorrhage and edema.",2017,,"Mostofa R, Ahmed S, Begum MM, Sohanur Rahman M, Begum T, Ahmed SU, Tuhin RH, Das M, Hossain A, Sharma M, Begum R.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1771-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Lam. is a functional food and belongs to family Convolvulaceae. It is used as an antiinflammatory, aphrodisiac, antiasthmatic, anticonvalescent, antitumor, antanemic and antidiabetic agent by local communities. This study has been planned to evaluate its antiinflammatory and antiarthritic potentials.<h4>Methods</h4>Dry powder of I. batatas tuber and roots were extracted with ethyl acetate (IPT-EA, IPR-EA) and methanol (IPT-M, IPR-M), respectively. These extracts were tested for total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC), HPLC finger printing, multidimensional in vitro and in vivo antioxidant potential and albumin denaturation inhibition. Carrageenan-induced paw edema, croton oil-induced ear and anal edema inhibition and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced antiarthritic assays were executed at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight on Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum levels of interleukins IL-1β and IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO) were assessed to measure the inhibition of inflammation.<h4>Results</h4>Maximal TPC (319.81 ± 14.20 μg GAE/mg dry extract) and TFC (208.77 ± 9.09 μg QE/mg DE) were estimated in IPR-EA extract. IPT-EA and IPR-EA yielded the maximum amounts of rutin (7.3 ± 1.12 and 4.5 ± 0.55), caffeic acid (1.60 ± 0.25 and 2.17 ± 0.26) and myricetin (2.7 ± 0.14 and 1.01 ± 0.08 μg/mg DE), respectively in HPLC-DAD analysis. All extracts showed dose dependent response in in vitro antioxidant assays. Best inhibition (76.92 ± 3.07%) of albumin denaturation was shown by IPT-EA in comparison to ibuprofen (79.48 ± 4.71%). IPR-EA exhibited highest edema inhibition in models of carrageenan-induced paw edema (79.11 ± 5.47%) and croton oil-induced ear and anal edema (72.01 ± 7.80% and 70.80 ± 4.94%, respectively). Significant inhibition of CFA-induced arthritic edema and arthritic score were observed by IPR-EA as compared to ibuprofen. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6) and NO levels was shown by IPR-EA and IPT-EA, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results depict that richness of polyphenols and phytoconstituents in I. batatas ameliorates oxidative stress and inflammation of acute and chronic nature.

They possess analgesic, anti-tubercular, anti-inflammatory, anti-convulsant, anti-oxidant, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity. This study was designed and conducted to evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities of Triazole derivatives.<h4>Methods</h4>Swiss albino (male and female) mice weighing 20-30 g (10-24 weeks female), (5-14 weeks male) and Wister Kyoto rats (male and female) weighing 200-300 g (8-10 weeks old) were used for the present study.

The lack of reliable safety data often leads to either under- or over-dose of medications during clinical management which make them either not responding well to treatment or susceptible to adverse drug reactions (ADRs).<h4>Aim</h4>This study investigated ADR signalling techniques to detect serious ADRs in Malaysian children aged from birth to 12 years old using an electronic ADRs' database.<h4>Methods</h4>Four techniques (Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS)) were tested on ADR reports submitted to the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency between 2016 and 2020.

Parameters investigated included growth, survival, lung histopathology and mRNA expression.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen inhibited angiogenesis in HUVECs, as shown by reduced tube formation, migration and cell proliferation via inhibition of the cell cycle S-phase and promotion of apoptosis. Treatment of newborn rat pups with ibuprofen reduced pulmonary vessel density in the developing lung, but also attenuated experimental BPD by reducing lung inflammation, alveolar enlargement, alveolar septum thickness and small arteriolar wall thickening.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In conclusion, ibuprofen has dual effects on lung development: adverse effects on angiogenesis and beneficial effects on alveolarization and inflammation.

In A-T mouse models, LPS-induced neuroinflammation advances the degenerative changes found in cerebellar Purkinje neurons both in vivo and in vitro. In the current study, we ask whether ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can have the opposite effect and delay the symptoms of the disease.<h4>Methods</h4>We tested the beneficial effects of ibuprofen in both in vitro and in vivo models. Conditioned medium from LPS stimulated primary microglia (LM) applied to cultures of dissociated cortical neurons leads to numerous degenerative changes. Pretreatment of the neurons with ibuprofen, however, blocked this damage. Systemic injection of LPS into either adult wild-type or adult Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice produced an immune challenge that triggered profound behavioral, biochemical, and histological effects. We used a 2-week ibuprofen pretreatment regimen to investigate whether these LPS effects could be blocked. We also treated young presymptomatic Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice to determine if ibuprofen could delay the appearance of symptoms.<h4>Results</h4>Adding ibuprofen directly to neuronal cultures significantly reduced LM-induced degeneration. Curiously, adding ibuprofen to the microglia cultures before the LPS challenge had little effect, thus implying a direct effect of the NSAID on the neuronal cultures. In vivo administration of ibuprofen to Atm<sup>-/-</sup> animals before a systemic LPS immune challenge suppressed cytological damage. The ibuprofen effects were widespread as microglial activation, p38 phosphorylation, DNA damage, and neuronal cell cycle reentry were all reduced. Unfortunately, ibuprofen only slightly improved the LPS-induced behavioral deficits. Yet, while the behavioral symptoms could not be reversed once they were established in adult Atm<sup>-/-</sup> animals, administration of ibuprofen to young mutant pups prevented their symptoms from appearing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Inflammatory processes impact the normal progression of A-T implying that modulation of the immune system can have therapeutic benefit for both the behavioral and cellular symptoms of this neurodegenerative disease.",2018,,"Hui CW, Song X, Ma F, Shen X, Herrup K.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1338-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Unfortunately, current treatments for these diseases are limited at best. Genetic and other preclinical evidence suggest a relationship between retinal degeneration and inflammation. To further explore this relationship, we tested whether Ibuprofen (IBU), an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), could promote PR survival and function in a mouse model of light damage (LD)-induced PR degeneration.<h4>Methods</h4>LD was induced by exposing mice to 4000 lx of light for 2-4 hours (h). IBU (100 or 200 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by daily intraperitoneal injection. Retinal structure and function were evaluated by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and electroretinography (ERG). Cell death genes were analyzed at 24 and 72 h after LD using the Mouse Pan-Cell Death Pathway PCR Array (88 genes). The cellular location and protein expression of key necroptosis genes were assessed by immunohistochemistry.<h4>Results</h4>Retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness in vehicle-injected LD animals was 8.7 ± 0.6% of retinas without LD (p < 0.0001). In IBU 200 mg/kg treated mice, central ONL thickness was 74.9 ± 7.7% of untreated retinas (p < 0.001). A-wave and b-wave ERG amplitudes were significantly preserved in IBU-treated animals. IBU significantly inhibited retinal inflammation. Twenty-four hour after LD, retinal mRNA expression for the inflammatory-factors tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), interleukin-1 beta (Il1B), and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) increased by 10-, 17-, and 533-fold, respectively; in IBU-treated animals, the expression levels of these inflammatory factors were not significantly different from no-LD controls. Expression of key necroptosis genes, including Ripk3 and Mlkl, were upregulated in LD vehicle-treated mice, but dramatically reduced to near no LD levels in LD IBU-treated mice. Microglia activation and MLKL protein upregulation were observed primarily in photoreceptors 12 h after LD, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. IBU reduced the upregulation of MLKL protein and microglia migration in the ONL and outer plexiform layer (OPL) of treated retinas.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Systemic administration of the anti-inflammatory drug IBU partially protected mouse retinas from light-induced photochemical damage and inhibited both inflammation and the necroptosis cell death pathways.

However, our knowledge about the safe usage of anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy is still limited. While human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC)-derived brain organoid models have started to explore functional consequences upon viral stimulation, these models commonly lack microglia, which are susceptible to and promote inflammation. Furthermore, microglia are actively involved in neuronal development. Here, we generate hIPSC-derived microglia precursor cells and assemble them into retinal organoids. Once the outer plexiform layer forms, these hIPSC-derived microglia (iMG) fully integrate into the retinal organoids. Since the ganglion cell survival declines by this time in 3D-retinal organoids, we adapted the model into 2D and identify that the improved ganglion cell number significantly decreases only with iMG presence. In parallel, we applied the immunostimulant POLY(I:C) to mimic a fetal viral infection. While POLY(I:C) exposure alters the iMG phenotype, it does not hinder their interaction with ganglion cells. Furthermore, iMG significantly enhance the supernatant's inflammatory secretome and increase retinal cell proliferation. Simultaneous exposure with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen dampens POLY(I:C)-mediated changes of the iMG phenotype and ameliorates cell proliferation. Remarkably, while POLY(I:C) disrupts neuronal calcium dynamics independent of iMG, ibuprofen rescues this effect only if iMG are present. Mechanistically, ibuprofen targets the enzymes cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX1/PTGS1 and COX2/PTGS2) simultaneously, from which iMG mainly express COX1. Selective COX1 blockage fails to restore the calcium peak amplitude upon POLY(I:C) stimulation, suggesting ibuprofen's beneficial effect depends on the presence and interplay of COX1 and COX2.

We have previously discovered that combinations of BBB nutrient transporter ligands alanine and glutathione (A-GSH), increase the permeability of vesicular and polypeptide nanocarriers containing model cargo across the BBB. Our aim was to investigate dopamine- and ibuprofen-coupled 3-armed poly(L-glutamic acid) nanocarriers targeted by A-GSH for transfer across a novel human co-culture model with induced BBB properties. In addition, the protective effect of ibuprofen containing nanoparticles on cytokine-induced barrier damage was also measured.<h4>Method</h4>Drug-coupled nanocarriers were synthetized and characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular effects, uptake, and permeability of the nanoparticles were investigated on a human stem cell-based co-culture BBB model with improved barrier properties induced by a small molecular cocktail. The model was characterized by immunocytochemistry and permeability for marker molecules. Nanocarrier uptake in human brain endothelial cells and midbrain organoids was quantified by spectrofluorometry and visualized by confocal microscopy. The mechanisms of cellular uptake were explored by addition of free targeting ligands, endocytic and metabolic inhibitors, co-localization of nanocarriers with intracellular organs, and surface charge modification of cells. The protective effect of ibuprofen-coupled nanocarriers was investigated against cytokine-induced barrier damage by impedance and permeability measurements.<h4>Results</h4>Targeted nanoformulations of both drugs showed elevated cellular uptake in a time-dependent, active manner via endocytic mechanisms. Addition of free ligands inhibited the cellular internalization of targeted nanocarriers suggesting the crucial role of ligands in the uptake process. A higher permeability across the BBB model was measured for targeted nanocarriers. After crossing the BBB, targeted dopamine nanocarriers subsequently entered midbrain-like organoids derived from healthy and Parkinson's disease patient-specific stem cells.

However, the mechanisms underlying pain-induced anxiety, such as its causality, temporal progression, and relevant neural networks are poorly understood, impeding the development of efficacious therapeutic approaches.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we have identified the sequential emergence of anxiety phenotypes in mice subjected to dental pulp injury (DPI), a prototypical model of orofacial pain that correlates with human toothache. Compared with sham controls, mice subjected to DPI by mechanically exposing the pulp to the oral environment exhibited significant signs of anxiogenic effects, specifically, altered behaviors on the elevated plus maze (EPM), novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) tests at 1 but not 3 days after the surgery. Notably, at 7 and 14 days, the DPI mice again avoided the open arm, center area, and novelty environment in the EPM, open field, and NSF tests, respectively. In particular, DPI-induced social phobia and increased repetitive grooming did not occur until 14 days after surgery, suggesting that DPI-induced social anxiety requires a long time. Moreover, oral administration of an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, or an analgesic agent, ProTx-II, which is a selective inhibitor of NaV1.7 sodium channels, both significantly alleviated DPI-induced avoidance in mice. Finally, to investigate the underlying central mechanisms, we pharmacologically blocked a popular form of synaptic plasticity with a GluA2-derived peptide, long-term depression, as that treatment significantly prevented the development of anxiety phenotype upon DPI.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Together, these results suggest a temporally progressive causal relationship between orofacial pain and anxiety, calling for more in-depth mechanistic studies on concomitant pain and anxiety disorders.",2015,,"Shang L, Xu TL, Li F, Su J, Li WG.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1186/s12990-015-0040-3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

They were randomly assigned into four treatment groups, an ibuprofen (positive control) group, two test groups of ECa233 each of 250 mg, and 500 mg extracts, and a placebo (negative control) group. All subjects were requested to self-administer the test/control capsules, twice a day for 14 days. The pain intensity score, range of mandibular motion and tenderness of the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were recorded at baseline, 7- and 14-days post-treatment.<h4>Results</h4>One week after intervention, the pain intensity score significantly decreased in participants receiving 500 mg of ECa233 (P = 0.016), as well as the placebo group (P = 0.030) but not in the other groups. Additionally, those receiving 500 mg of ECa233 displayed the highest percentage reduction in self-reported pain intensity and pain on TMJ palpation compared with the other groups (P > 0.050). On day 14, there were no significant differences observed among the evaluated parameters in the four groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The orally administered ECa233 has the potential to induce rapid, short term, dose-dependent analgesia in individuals with TMD pain. However, longer-term RCT with a larger cohort is necessary to confirm these findings.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>ECa 233 at 500 mg has the potential to induce a more rapid analgesic response in individuals with acute TMD after a 7-day period.<h4>Trial registration</h4>This trial was registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov, the number is NCT06231212, date of registration: 30/01/2024.",2025,,"Potewiratnanond P, Surarit R, Tantisira MH, Samaranayake L, Rotpenpian N, Wanasuntronwong A.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13005-025-00503-y,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether the use of medications during pregnancy, is associated with the risk of gastroschisis in offspring.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched from 1st January 1990 to 31st December 2020 to identify observational studies examining the association between medication use during pregnancy and the risk of gastroschisis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for the quality assessment of the individual studies. We pooled adjusted measures using a random-effect model to estimate relative risk [RR] and the 95% confidence interval [CI]. I<sup>2</sup> statistic for heterogeneity and publication bias was calculated.<h4>Results</h4>Eighteen studies providing data on 751,954 pregnancies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled RRs showed significant associations between aspirin (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.16-2.38; I<sup>2</sup> = 58.3%), oral contraceptives (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.21-1.92; I<sup>2</sup> = 22.0%), pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.16-1.97; I<sup>2</sup> = 33.2%), ibuprofen (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.26-1.60; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%), and gastroschisis. No association was observed between paracetamol and gastroschisis (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.41; I<sup>2</sup> = 39.4%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that the exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy to over the counter medications (OTC) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine as well as to oral contraceptives, was associated with an increased risk of gastroschisis. However, these associations are significant only in particular subgroups defined by geographic location, adjustment variables and type of control.

Moreover, conditioned media harvested from irradiated murine bone marrow, lung, and liver chemoattracted human ovarian cancer cells, and this chemotactic activity was inactivated by heat, suggesting a major involvement of peptide or peptide-bound chemoattractants. We also observed that human ovarian cancer cells proliferate better if exposed to cell debris harvested from irradiated murine bone marrow. Finally, the pro-metastatic microenvironment in mice induced by radio- or chemotherapy was significantly ameliorated if animals were treated at the time of radiotherapy administration with non-steroid (ibuprofen) or steroid (prednisone) anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, we propose that a radiochemotherapy-induced, pro-metastatic microenvironment plays an important role in the metastasis of cancer cells that are resistant to treatment. Such cells have characteristics of cancer stem cells and are highly migratory, and simple, intensive, anti-inflammatory treatment by non-steroid agents to suppress induction of pro-metastatic factors after radiochemotherapy would be an interesting anti-metastatic treatment alternative.",2015,,"Gunjal PM, Schneider G, Ismail AA, Kakar SS, Kucia M, Ratajczak MZ.",https://ovarianresearch.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13048-015-0141-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,25928129,25928129.0,10.1186/s13052-014-0092-4,Pediatric migraine and episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine.,"<h4>Importance</h4>Migraine is a common disorder and a frequent cause of medical consultation in children. Many childhood episodic syndromes have been described as common precursors of migraine.<h4>Objective</h4>To review current knowledge on migraine and childhood episodic syndromes, and to discuss future directions for research and clinical practice.<h4>Findings</h4>For most children it is difficult to describe a headache and fully verbalize symptoms such as photophobia and phonophobia that must be inferred from behaviour. Classical migraine features are rare before the age of 6 years, but some migraine-related syndromes have been described. Benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, cyclic vomiting syndrome and abdominal migraine are currently classified as childhood episodic syndromes, and therefore common precursors of migraine. A strong association between infantile colic and migraine has recently been reported. There are similarities between children with episodic syndromes and children with migraine, regarding social and demographic factors, precipitating and relieving factors, and accompanying gastrointestinal, neurologic, and vasomotor features. The real pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine are not fully understood. Current data obtained through molecular and functional studies provide a complex model in which vascular and neurologic events cooperate in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. Genetic factors causing disturbances in neuronal ion channels, make a migraineur more sensitive to multiple trigger factors that activate the nociception cascade. The expanding knowledge on migraine genetics and pathophysiology may be applicable to childhood episodic syndromes. Migraine preventive strategies are particularly important in children, and could be beneficial in childhood episodic syndromes. Nonspecific analgesics like ibuprofen and acetaminophen are widely used in pediatrics to control pain and have been found to be effective also in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Triptans are the specific fist-line drugs for acute migraine treatment.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Migraine phenotype differs somewhat in the developing brain, and childhood episodic syndromes may arise before typical migraine headache. Diagnosing pediatric migraine may be difficult because of children's language and cognitive abilities. The risk of underestimating migraine in pediatric age is high. An adequate diagnosis is important to maintain a good quality of life and to avoid inappropriate therapy.",2014,,"Spiri D, Rinaldi VE, Titomanlio L.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-014-0092-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Our aim was to critically evaluate the safety of ibuprofen during the course of pediatric infectious disease in order to promote its appropriate use in children.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Ibuprofen is associated with severe necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) during chickenpox course. Pre-hospital use of ibuprofen seems to increase the risk of complicated pneumonia in children. Conflicting data have been published in septic children, while ibuprofen in the setting of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) exacerbations is safe and efficacious. No data is yet available for ibuprofen use during COVID-19 course. Ibuprofen should not be recommended for chickenpox management. Due to possible higher risks of complicated pneumonia, we suggest caution on its use in children with respiratory symptoms. While it remains unclear whether ibuprofen may have harmful effects during systemic bacterial infection, its administration is recommended in CF course.

Effective management of these conditions is essential to ensuring comfort and preventing complications. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen are the most frequently used medications for treating fever and pain in children owing to their proven efficacy and safety profiles when used appropriately. However, despite their widespread use, both medications have the potential of having serious adverse effects if misused, highlighting the importance of therapeutic awareness among healthcare providers. A careful evaluation of current clinical guidelines for fever and pain management in children was carried out. A survey of recommendations regarding the dosing, timing, and combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen was also conducted in order to optimize treatment while minimizing risks. Recent evidence supports the combination of these two drugs as both effective and safe for managing moderate to severe pain in pediatric patients, offering enhanced symptom relief without significant increases in side effects. This combination has been shown to provide superior analgesic effects as compared to monotherapy, thus improving patient outcomes. However, it is critical that clinicians adhere to established guidelines to avoid potential complications, such as liver toxicity from excessive paracetamol dosing or gastrointestinal issues from ibuprofen. Overall, therapeutic awareness, guided by evidence-based practices and the careful application of clinical recommendations, is essential for optimizing fever and pain management in pediatric care, ensuring both efficacy and safety in treating these common yet distressing symptoms.",2025,,"de'Angelis GL, Vincenzi F, Fornaroli F, Buonvicino D, Chiarugi A.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-025-02107-3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Patients received a CH loading-dose of 10 mg/kg enterally, then a syringe-pump enteral infusion at 5 mg/kg/hour, increasing to a maximum of 9 mg/kg/hour. Cases were compared to historical controls matched for age group and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (PRISM) category, using Fisher's exact test and the t test. The primary outcome was feasibility, defined as the use of an enteral CH continuous infusion without discontinuation attributable to a pre-specified potential harm.<h4>Results</h4>There were 21 patients enrolled, at age 11.4 (12.1) months, with bronchiolitis in 10 (48%), a mean Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score of 6.2 (5.2), and having received enteral CH continuous infusion for 4.5 (2.2) days. Infusion of CH was feasible in 20/21 (95%; 95% CI 76-99%) patients, with one (5%) adverse event of duodenal ulcer perforation on day 3 in a patient with croup receiving regular ibuprofen and dexamethasone. The CH infusion dose (mg/kg/h) on day 2 (n = 20) was 8.9 (IQR 5.9, 9), and on day 4 (n = 11) was 8.8 (IQR 7, 9). Days to titration of adequate sedation (defined as ≤ 3 PRN doses/shift) was 1 (IQR 0.5, 2.5), and hours to awakening for extubation was 5 (IQR 2, 9).

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used worldwidely to treat several pain-related diseases including migraines. However, whether EA with low or high frequency exerts a distinct analgesic effect remains unknown and needs further study.<h4>Methods/design</h4>This study is a randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with three parallel arms. A total of 144 migraine outpatients will be randomly allocated to the 2 Hz EA group, 100 Hz EA group and placebo control group. The duration of the trial is 20 weeks, including a 4-week-long baseline assessment period (weeks - 4-0), a 4-week-long treatment period (weeks 1-4) and a 12-week-long follow-up period (weeks 5-16). Twelve treatment sessions will be performed over a 4-week period (weeks 1-4). The primary outcome will be measured by the frequency of migraine attacks in the past 4 weeks at the end of week 4 post-randomisation. The secondary outcome will be measured by the frequency of migraine attacks in the past 4 weeks at the end of weeks 8, 12 and16 post-randomisation; number of days with migraine; dosage of ibuprofen; the scores of visual analogue scale (VAS); Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS); and Migraine Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MSQ) in the past 4 weeks at the end of weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 post-randomisation.

Dentists are among the leading prescribers of opioid analgesics. Opioid-seeking behaviors have been linked to receipt of initial opioid prescriptions following the common dental procedure of third molar extraction. With each opioid prescription, a patient's risk for opioid misuse or abuse increases. With an estimated 56 million tablets of 5 mg hydrocodone annually prescribed after third molar extractions in the USA, 3.5 million young adults may be unnecessarily exposed to opioids by dentists who are inadvertently increasing their patient's risk for addiction.<h4>Methods</h4>A double-blind, stratified randomized, multi-center clinical trial has been designed to evaluate whether a combination of over-the-counter non-opioid-containing analgesics is not inferior to the most prescribed opioid analgesic. The impacted 3rd molar extraction model is being used due to the predictable severity of the post-operative pain and generalizability of results. Within each site/clinic and gender type (male/female), patients are randomized to receive either OPIOID (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/300 mg) or NON-OPIOID (ibuprofen/acetaminophen 400/500 mg). Outcome data include pain levels, adverse events, overall patient satisfaction, ability to sleep, and ability to perform daily functions. To develop clinical guidelines and a clinical decision-making tool, pain management, extraction difficulty, and the number of tablets taken are being collected, enabling an experimental decision-making tool to be developed.<h4>Discussion</h4>The proposed methods address the shortcomings of other analgesic studies. Although prior studies have tested short-term effects of single doses of pain medications, patients and their dentists are interested in managing pain for the entire post-operative period, not just the first 12 h. After surgery, patients expect to be able to perform normal daily functions without feeling nauseous or dizzy and they desire a restful sleep at night. Parents of young people are concerned with the risks of opioid use and misuse, related either to treatments received or to subsequent use of leftover pills. Upon successful completion of this clinical trial, dentists, patients, and their families will be better able to make informed decisions regarding post-operative pain management.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04452344 .

The systematic stratification of patients for personalized treatment does not exist for TB. As each TB case is different, individualized treatment regimens should be applied to obtain better outcomes. In this scenario, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to (1) improve outcomes and (2) shorten treatment duration, and host-directed therapies (HDT) might be the best solution. Within HDT, repurposed drugs represent a shortcut in drug development and can be implemented at the short term. As hyperinflammation is associated with worse outcomes, HDT with an anti-inflammatory effect might improve outcomes by reducing tissue damage and thus the risk of permanent sequelae.<h4>Methods</h4>SMA-TB is a multicentre randomized, phase IIB, placebo-controlled, three-arm, double-blinded clinical trial (CT) that has been designed in the context of the EC-funded SMA-TB Project ( www.smatb.eu ) in which we propose to use 2 common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and ibuprofen (Ibu), as an HDT for use as adjunct therapy added to, and compared with, the standard of care (SoC) World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended TB regimen in TB patients. A total of 354 South African and Georgian adults diagnosed with confirmed pulmonary TB will be randomized into SoC TB treatment + placebo, SoC + acetylsalicylic acid or SoC + ibuprofen.<h4>Discussion</h4>SMA-TB will provide proof of concept of the HDT as a co-adjuvant treatment and identify the suitability of the intervention for different population groups (different epidemiological settings and drug susceptibility) in the reduction of tissue damage and risk of bad outcomes for TB patients. This regimen potentially will be more effective and targeted: organ saving, reducing tissue damage and thereby decreasing the length of treatment and sequelae, increasing cure rates and pathogen clearance and decreasing transmission rates. It will result in better clinical practice, care management and increased well-being of TB patients.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04575519.

However, NSAIDs were recently shown to impede the muscle healing process after acute injury. Migration of skeletal muscle cells is a crucial step during the muscle healing process. The present study was performed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanisms of action of ibuprofen, a commonly used NSAID, on the migration of skeletal muscle cells.<h4>Methods</h4>Skeletal muscle cells isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle of Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ibuprofen. MTT assay (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was used to evaluate cell viability, and cell apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay, after ibuprofen treatment. Skeletal muscle cell migration and spreading were evaluated using the transwell filter migration assay and F-actin staining, respectively. The protein expression of p130cas and CrkII, which are cell migration facilitating genes, was determined by western blot analysis. The overexpression of p130cas of muscle cells was achieved by p130cas vector transfection.<h4>Results</h4>The results demonstrated that ibuprofen did not have a significant negative effect on cell viability and apoptosis. Ibuprofen inhibited the migration and spreading of skeletal muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner. Ibuprofen also dose-dependently decreased the protein expression of p130cas and CrkII. Furthermore, overexpression of p130cas resulted in the promotion of cell migration and spreading and counteracted ibuprofen-mediated inhibition.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggested that ibuprofen exerts a potentially adverse effect on the migration of skeletal muscle cells by downregulating protein expression of p130cas and CrkII.

While antibiotics have been found to induce HGT, it remains unknown whether non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals can facilitate conjugation at a microbial community-wide level.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we demonstrate that several commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (including carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen and propranolol), at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.5 mg/L), can promote the conjugative transfer of IncP1-α plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance across entire microbial communities. The over-generation of reactive oxygen species in response to these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals may contribute to the enhanced conjugation ratios. Cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses indicated that non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals modulate transconjugant microbial communities at both phylum and genus levels. Moreover, microbial uptake ability of the IncP1-α plasmid was also upregulated under non-antibiotic pharmaceutical exposure. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Acinetobacter and Legionella, were more likely to acquire the plasmid conferring multidrug resistance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Considering the high possibility of co-occurrence of pathogenic bacteria, conjugative IncP1-α plasmids and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in various environments (e.g., activated sludge systems), our findings illustrate the potential risk associated with increased dissemination of antibiotic resistance promoted by non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in complex environmental settings.

Through rodent modeling, the poor prognosis of PPBC has been attributed to physiologic mammary gland involution, which shapes a tumor promotional microenvironment through induction of wound-healing-like programs including myeloid cell recruitment. Previous studies utilizing immune compromised mice have shown that blocking prostaglandin synthesis reduces PPBC tumor progression in a tumor cell extrinsic manner. Given the reported roles of prostaglandins in myeloid and T cell biology, and the established importance of these immune cell populations in dictating tumor growth, we investigate the impact of involution on shaping the tumor immune milieu and its mitigation by ibuprofen in immune competent hosts.<h4>Methods</h4>In a syngeneic (D2A1) orthotopic Balb/c mouse model of PPBC, we characterized the impact of mammary gland involution and ibuprofen treatment on the immune milieu in tumors and draining lymph nodes utilizing flow cytometry, multiplex IHC, lipid mass spectroscopy and cytokine arrays. To further investigate the impact of ibuprofen on programming myeloid cell populations, we performed RNA-Seq on in vivo derived mammary myeloid cells from ibuprofen treated and untreated involution group mice. Further, we examined direct effects of ibuprofen through in vitro bone marrow derived myeloid cell cultures.<h4>Results</h4>Tumors implanted into the mammary involution microenvironment grow more rapidly and display a distinct immune milieu compared to tumors implanted into glands of nulliparous mice. This milieu is characterized by increased presence of immature monocytes and reduced numbers of T cells and is reversed upon ibuprofen treatment. Further, ibuprofen treatment enhances Th1 associated cytokines as well as promotes tumor border accumulation of T cells. Safety studies demonstrate ibuprofen does not impede gland involution, impact subsequent reproductive success, nor promote auto-reactivity as detected through auto-antibody and naïve T cell priming assays.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen administration during the tumor promotional microenvironment of the involuting mammary gland reduces overall tumor growth and enhances anti-tumor immune characteristics while avoiding adverse autoimmune reactions.

This study examined the safety and efficacy of ibuprofen gargle in healthy volunteers and patients with chemotherapy- and concomitant CRT-induced oral mucositis.<h4>Methods</h4>We enrolled healthy volunteers and patients with chemotherapy- and CRT-induced oral mucositis. In cohort I, single and multiple doses of ibuprofen gargle (0.6% or 1.0%) were administered to healthy volunteers on day 1 and days 4-10. In cohort II, multiple doses of ibuprofen gargle (0.6%) were administered to patients with complicated grade 2-3 oral mucositis based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The primary endpoint of cohort I was the treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) as defined by CTCAE version 4.0. The primary endpoint of cohort II was the change in the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score from before to 15 min after gargle use on day 3. The incidence and severity of TRAEs were assessed based on the CTCAE version 4.0 and a subjective rating scale completed by healthy volunteers and patients.<h4>Results</h4>In cohort I, 9 of 10 healthy volunteers were evaluable for safety. All 9 healthy volunteers reported the TRAE of oral irritation with single or multiple use of the gargle. In cohort II, 10 patients were enrolled and evaluable for safety and 7 of 10 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The mean change in the VAS pain score from before to 15 min after using the gargle on day 3 was - 1.28 (95% confidence interval: - 2.06, - 0.51), and all patients experienced some degree of pain relief (range: - 0.2 to - 2.5). All 10 patients reported the TRAE of oral irritation. No other TRAEs of ibuprofen gargle were observed in the healthy volunteers and patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite oral irritation, the ibuprofen gargle appeared to be safe and effective for the pain related to chemo- or CRT-induced oral mucositis.

In many parts of the world, NSAIDs can be purchased over-the-counter and used without any physician oversight. However, the chronic nature of overuse injuries requires NSAIDs to be taken orally for an extended period of time. As a result, they can have significant adverse effects on athletes, namely gastrointestinal (GI), renal, and cardiovascular damage. Dyspepsia and upper GI ulceration and bleeding are of great concern in chronic NSAID use, and as such oral NSAIDs are generally contraindicated in those with a history of peptic ulcers or irritable bowel disease. In the setting of chronic overuse soft tissue or joint disease, topically administered NSAIDs offer an alternate route of administration that has the potential to deliver a similar level of pain and anti-inflammatory relief while bypassing the harmful side effects associated with oral intake. Topically applied NSAIDs are able to achieve high concentrations within the targeted site of action while simultaneously keeping plasma concentrations low, offering several advantages over oral administration. One commonly used generic NSAID is ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid). First synthesized in the 1960s, ibuprofen has since become widely available as an over-the-counter pharmaceutical.

Current pharmacovigilance systems still have substantial limitations, however. The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP), the comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR), and association statistics for pharmacovigilance purposes. DESIGN Narrative discharge summaries were collected from the Clinical Information System at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). MedLEE, an NLP system, was applied to the collection to identify medication events and entities which could be potential adverse drug events (ADEs). Co-occurrence statistics with adjusted volume tests were used to detect associations between the two types of entities, to calculate the strengths of the associations, and to determine their cutoff thresholds. Seven drugs/drug classes (ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion, paroxetine, rosiglitazone, ACE inhibitors) with known ADEs were selected to evaluate the system. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two potential ADEs were found to be associated with the 7 drugs. Overall recall and precision were 0.75 and 0.31 for known ADEs respectively. Importantly, qualitative evaluation using historic roll back design suggested that novel ADEs could be detected using our system. CONCLUSIONS This study provides a framework for the development of active, high-throughput and prospective systems which could potentially unveil drug safety profiles throughout their entire market life.

Herein, we used a large prospective cohort study to examine these associations.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>In total, 64,839 men and women age 50 to 76 years were recruited from 2000 to 2002 to the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) study. Incident hematologic malignancies (n = 577) were identified through December 2008 by linkage to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with use of analgesics for total incident hematologic malignancies and cancer subcategories were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, self-rated health, arthritis, chronic musculoskeletal pain, migraines, headaches, fatigue, and family history of leukemia/lymphoma.<h4>Results</h4>After adjustment, there was an increased risk of incident hematologic malignancies associated with high use (≥ 4 days/week for ≥ 4 years) of acetaminophen (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.50 for high use; P trend = .004). This association was seen for myeloid neoplasms (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.12), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.93), and plasma cell disorders (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.08 to 5.41), but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.31 to 2.28). By comparison, there was no association with risk of incident hematologic malignancies for increasing use of aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs, or ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>High use of acetaminophen was associated with an almost two-fold increased risk of incident hematologic malignancies other than CLL/SLL.

The effect of concentration of hydrophilic matrix (HPMC K(4)M), binder (polyvinylpyrollidone [PVP K(30)]) and buffer (sodium bicarbonate) on IB release was studied. The dissolution study of sustained release layer showed that an increasing amount of HPMC or PVP K(30) results in reduced IB release. The inclusion of buffer (sodium bicarbonate) enhanced the release of IB from sustained release layer. The rational for formulation of bi-layer tablet of these two drugs in combination was (1) MTH increases the absorption of acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) by increasing gastric motility. So sequential release of MTH (as immediate release) and IB (as sustained release) was suitable for treatment of migraine. (2) MTH was degraded when prolonged contact with acidic NSAID.

Unfortunately, the acidic nature of ibuprofen minimizes the amount of drug that can be solubilized under gastric conditions and would be available for immediate absorption upon entry into the intestine. Although the sodium salt of ibuprofen has higher solubility, rapid conversion from the salt to the poorly soluble free acid phase occurs under gastric conditions. Therefore, the combination of the highly soluble sodium salt form of ibuprofen with polymers was evaluated as an approach to prolong supersaturation of ibuprofen during the disproportionation of the salt. Binary combinations of ibuprofen sodium with polymers resulted in the identification of several formulations that demonstrated high degrees and extended durations of supersaturation during in vitro dissolution experiments. These formulations included HPMC, polyvinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVP-VA64), methylcellulose (MC), and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). The in vitro supersaturation observed with these ibuprofen-polymer formulations translated to an increase in Cmax and an earlier Tmax for the PVP-VA64, MC, and HPC formulations relative to ibuprofen only controls when administered orally to rats under fasted conditions. Based on these observations, combining ibuprofen sodium with polymers such as PVP-VA64, MC, or HPC is a viable formulation approach to prolong supersaturation in the stomach and enable an optimized pharmacokinetic profile in vivo where rapid onset of action is desired.",2014,,"Terebetski JL, Cummings JJ, Fauty SE, Michniak-Kohn B.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4179647?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

NEs were prepared by the spontaneous emulsification method and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The composition of the optimal formulation was statistically optimized using Box-Behnken experimental design method with three independent factors and was characterized for particle size, polydispersity index, and percent transmittance. The selected formula was tested for its in vitro antioxidant activity and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. The optimized HNa-Ind NE formula was characterized and displayed a particle size of 12.87 ± 0.032 nm, polydispersity index of 0.606 ± 0.082, and 99.4 ± 0.1 percentage of transmittance. FTIR showed no interaction between HNa and Ind as a physical mixture. In addition, the optimized HNa-Ind NE was able to preserve the antioxidant ability of the two drugs, as evidenced through a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition assay used to assess free radical scavenging ability. The cell viability was increased while the free radical scavenging activity was decreased (94.28% inhibition at higher concentrations compared with vitamin C as a reference with an inhibition of 100%). Moreover, the pharmacological anti-inflammatory potential of the optimized HNa-Ind NE formulation was assessed using an in vivo model. Compared with reference drugs (ibuprofen gel 5%), the remarkable activity of the optimized formulation was established using xylene-induced ear edema in mice model, in which the inflamed region reduced by 92.5% upon treatment. The optimized HNa-Ind NE formulation showed considerably higher skin permeation and drug deposition capability compared with the HNa-Ind solution. HNa-Ind NE was demonstrated to be a successful carrier with enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential while showing better skin penetration, thus being a promising vehicle for transdermal drug delivery.",2019,,"Guermech I, Lassoued MA, Abdelhamid A, Sfar S.",https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-019-1543-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To consummate this objective, we developed a skin permeation nanogel system containing surface active agent along with ethanol. Carbopol 971p, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC K15M), and chitosan were used to fabricate the nanogels. The nanogel system was evaluated for pH, content uniformity, spreadability, rheological studies, in vitro skin permeation, and drug release. Carbapol 971p with the desired in vitro skin permeation was utilized to investigate skin irritation test and effects on inflammation using acute inflammatory paw edema models. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic study was assessed. pH of this nanogels was found within the range of 6.1-7.2, whereas the viscosity was found 310.13 to 6361 cps. The ex vivo skin permeation gels showed permeation flux range, 5.9 ± 0.80 to 17.92 ± 1.13 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> h. The highest permeation flux (17.92 ± 1.13 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> h) was observed, which was 3.14-folds higher than that of the plain DH gel (10.72 ± 0.84 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> h. Additionally, from toxicological study, no obvious signs of toxicity such as skin irritation (of laboratory rats) were identified. The in vivo anti-inflammatory behavior in carrageenan-induced rats showed comparatively higher inhibition of rat paw edema swelling by the prepared nanogel compared to that of the plain DH gel and marketed ibuprofen over 6 h. The amount of drug accumulated in the skin after topical application was much higher than oral application.

The low solubility of ibuprofen is advantageous for forming a gel when exposed to an aqueous phase. The 1% w/w fluconazole-loaded in situ gel oral sprays were developed utilizing various concentrations of ibuprofen in N-methyl pyrrolidone. The prepared solutions underwent evaluation for viscosity, surface tension, contact angle, water tolerance, gel formation, interface interaction, drug permeation, and antimicrobial studies. The higher amount of ibuprofen reduced the surface tension and retarded solvent exchange. The use of 50% ibuprofen as a gelling agent demonstrated prolonged drug permeation for up to 24 h. The incorporation of Cremophor EL in the formulations resulted in increased drug permeation and exhibited effective inhibition against Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida tropicalis. While the Cremophor EL-loaded formulation did not exhibit enhanced antifungal effects on agar media, its ability to facilitate the permeation of fluconazole and ibuprofen suggested potential efficacy in countering Candida invasion in the oral mucosa. Moreover, these formulations demonstrated significant thermal inhibition of protein denaturation in egg albumin, indicating anti-inflammatory properties.

The release of ibuprofen from this polymeric prodrug has been studied under conditions simulating those encountered in the skin. The polymeric prodrug of ibuprofen was found to undergo pH-dependent hydrolysis, ranging from negligible hydrolysis at pH 4 to 23.9% hydrolysis at pH 8.5 (15% at pH 7.4) after 48 h at 37 degrees C. The polymer-drug conjugate was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis in human plasma. The polymer showed considerable enzymatic hydrolysis (68% after 48 h). The results showed that the polymeric prodrug model of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) described here can be used in topical formulations of NSAIDs.

After Food and Drug Administration approval of erenumab, both patients started subcutaneous erenumab monthly as allowed per protocol.<h4>Results</h4>Patients were women 44 and 36 years of age with ≥2 decades of self-reported suboptimal response to multiple migraine medications. Patient 1 used rimegepant for 6 months and then started erenumab 70 mg subcutaneous monthly. Despite a response to preventive treatment with erenumab, she experienced substantial relief treating 7 of 7 acute attacks with rimegepant and eliminated regular, frequent use of ibuprofen and a caffeinated analgesic. Patient 2 used rimegepant for 60 days before starting erenumab 140 mg subcutaneously monthly. While on erenumab, 9 of 9 attacks treated with rimegepant responded. She stopped near-daily use of injectable ketorolac and diphenhydramine. While using rimegepant alone or together with erenumab, patients reported no related adverse events.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Rimegepant 75 mg may be effective for acute treatment during concomitant erenumab preventive administration. The mechanism underlying the benefits of concomitant use of a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist and an anti-CGRP receptor antibody is unknown and requires further study.<h4>Clinicaltrialsgov identifier</h4>NCT03266588.<h4>Classification of evidence</h4>This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with migraine using erenumab, rimegepant is effective for acute treatment.",2020,,"Mullin K, Kudrow D, Croop R, Lovegren M, Conway CM, Coric V, Lipton RB.",https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000008944,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The in vitro and in vivo skin permeability of tegafur, alclofenac and ibuprofen was enhanced by the use of ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) or ethanol/water (60/40) binary vehicles as a donor composition. However, the two vehicles showed contrastive properties in relation to the extent of permeation enhancement of the three drugs: tegafur > alclofenac > ibuprofen for the ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) system, and ibuprofen > or = alclofenac > tegafur for the ethanol/water (60/40) system. When lauric acid, as a permeation enhancer, was added to both of the binary vehicles, the in vitro and in vivo skin permeability of three drugs further increased, and the in vivo absorption rate of the drugs from the ethanol/water (60/40) system was larger than that from the ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) system. In conclusion, it was suggested that the ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) lipophilic binary vehicle is useful for hydrophilic drugs, and conversely, the skin absorption of lipophilic drugs can be improved by the use of the ethanol/water (60/40) hydrophilic binary vehicle with or without lauric acid as a permeation enhancer.",1993,,"Lee CK, Uchida T, Kitagawa K, Yagi A, Kim NS, Goto S.",https://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.16.1264,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

TAI-284 prevented the rat erythrocyte from heat-induced hemolysis and was twice as potent as IMC. TAI-284 produced alterations in platelet function as characterized by loss of secondary aggregation in response to ADP and inhibition of aggregation by collagen. Both these effects were one fifth as potent as those seen with IMC. In rats, platelet aggregation induced by collagen and secondary ADP aggregation was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by a single oral administration of TAI-284. The inhibitory activity was approximately one fourth that of IMC or twice that of IP in the former and in the latter one fifth that of IMC or similar as that of IP.

Mifamurtide's rational drug design employs MTP-PE for macrophage activation in a multilamellar liposome drug carrier, containing the synthetic phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidyl choline (POPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidyl serine (OOPS). Although the drug is not cytotoxic towards normal or tumor cells in vitro, immune activation against osteosarcoma lung metastases in vivo accounts for mifamurtide's antiosteosarcoma effects. Phosphatidyl serine-containing lipids signal macrophage cells that have ""flipped phosphatidyl serine"" to the outer membrane after apoptosis (e.g., after damage of tumor cells from chemotherapy); thus, both mifamurtide's active and inactive ingredients target immune cells in the lungs. Mifamurtide administration has resulted in 8% and 13% improvement in 6- and 5-year overall survivals, when added to chemotherapy in nonmetastatic and metastatic patients with osteosarcoma, respectively. The short-term toxicities of mifamurtide (fever, headache, flu-like symptoms and rigors) are reduced or eliminated using ibuprofen (200 mg) as premedication for the first infusion; an algorithm for pre- and postmedication is presented.

In the present study, isolated male and female CKO-cardiomyocytes exhibit increased prostaglandin (PG)-generating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The PG-degrading hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase-15 (HPGD) expression is only reduced in male cardiomyocytes, which is associated with increased prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) secretion from isolated male but not female CKO-cardiomyocytes. Reduced HPGD expression in male cardiomyocytes derive from impaired androgen receptor (AR)-signaling due to loss of its cofactor STAT3. Elevated PGD2 secretion in males is associated with increased white adipocyte accumulation in aged male but not female hearts. Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in isolated stem cell antigen-1 (SCA-1)+ cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) from young male CKO-mice compared with the adipocyte differentiation of male wild-type (WT)-CPC and CPC isolated from female mice. Epigenetic analysis in freshly isolated male CKO-CPC display hypermethylation in pro-angiogenic genes (Fgfr2, Epas1) and hypomethylation in the white adipocyte differentiation gene Zfp423 associated with up-regulated ZFP423 expression and a shift from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation compared with WT-CPC. The expression of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 is reduced in male CKO-CPC compared with male WT-CPC, whereas no differences in the EZH2 expression in female CPC were observed. Clonally expanded CPC can differentiate into endothelial cells or into adipocytes depending on the differentiation conditions. ZFP423 overexpression is sufficient to induce white adipocyte differentiation of clonal CPC. In isolated WT-CPC, PGD2 stimulation reduces the expression of EZH2, thereby up-regulating ZFP423 expression and promoting white adipocyte differentiation. The treatment of young male CKO mice with the COX inhibitor Ibuprofen or the PGD2 receptor (DP)2 receptor antagonist BAY-u 3405 in vivo increased EZH2 expression and reduced ZFP423 expression and adipocyte differentiation in CKO-CPC. Thus, cardiomyocyte STAT3 deficiency leads to age-related and sex-specific cardiac remodeling and failure in part due to sex-specific alterations in PGD2 secretion and subsequent epigenetic impairment of the differentiation potential of CPC. Causally involved is the impaired AR signaling in absence of STAT3, which reduces the expression of the PG-degrading enzyme HPGD.",2020,,"Stelling E, Ricke-Hoch M, Erschow S, Hoffmann S, Bergmann AK, Heimerl M, Pietzsch S, Battmer K, Haase A, Stapel B, Scherr M, Balligand JL, Binah O, Hilfiker-Kleiner D.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000739,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Drug disposition into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also subject to age-related variation and can be further influenced by brain diseases affecting blood-brain barrier integrity, like meningitis. Here, we developed a generic pediatric brain PBPK model to predict CSF concentrations of drugs that undergo passive transfer, including age-appropriate parameters. The model was validated for the analgesics paracetamol, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen and naproxen, and for a pediatric meningitis population by empirical optimization of the blood-brain barrier penetration of the antibiotic meropenem. Plasma and CSF drug concentrations derived from the literature were used to perform visual predictive checks and to calculate ratios between simulated and observed area under the concentration curves (AUCs) in order to evaluate model performance. Model-simulated concentrations were comparable to observed data over a broad age range (3 months-15 years postnatal age) for all drugs investigated. The ratios between observed and simulated AUCs (AUCo/AUCp) were within 2-fold difference both in plasma (range 0.92-1.09) and in CSF (range 0.64-1.23) indicating acceptable model performance. The model was also able to describe disease-mediated changes in neonates and young children (<3m postnatal age) related to meningitis and sepsis (range AUCo/AUCp plasma: 1.64-1.66, range AUCo/AUCp CSF: 1.43-1.73).

Although there are published meta-analyses of analgesic therapy in PHN, and neuropathic pain in general, the evidence base has been substantially enhanced by the recent publication of several major trials. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for both efficacy and adverse events of analgesic therapy for PHN.<h4>Methods and findings</h4>We systematically searched databases (MEDLINE 1966-2004, EMBASE 1988-2004, CINAHL 1982-2002, and PubMed [29 October 2004]) for trials of PHN. We also searched references of retrieved studies and review articles for further trials. We included trials that examined adult patients with PHN of greater duration than 3 mo, that were blinded, randomised, and had at least one measure of pain outcome. Dichotomous pain outcome data were extracted for 50% decrease in baseline pain using a hierarchy of pain/pain-relief measurement tools. Where available, dichotomous data were also collected for adverse events. Calculated estimates of efficacy included relative benefit and number needed to treat. Of 62 studies identified, 35 were randomised controlled trials. Of these, 31 were placebo controlled and suitable for meta-analysis, from which it was possible to extract dichotomous efficacy outcome data from 25. This meta-analysis revealed that there is evidence to support the use of the following orally administered therapies: tricyclic antidepressants, ""strong"" opioids, gabapentin, tramadol, and pregabalin. Topical therapies associated with efficacy were lidocaine 5% patch and capsaicin. Finally, a single study of spinal intrathecal administration of lidocaine and methyl prednisolone demonstrated efficacy, although this has yet to be replicated. Data suggest that the following therapies are not associated with efficacy in PHN: certain NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., oral memantine, oral dextromethorphan, intravenous ketamine), codeine, ibuprofen, lorazepam, certain 5HT1 receptor agonists, and acyclovir. Topical administration of benzydamine, diclofenac/diethyl ether, and vincristine (iontophoresis) are similarly not associated with efficacy, nor are intrathecal administration of lidocaine alone or epidural administration of lidocaine and methylprednisolone, intravenous therapy with lidocaine, subcutaneous injection of Cronassial, or acupuncture. However, many of the trials that demonstrated a lack of efficacy represented comparatively low numbers of patient episodes or were single-dose studies, so it may be appropriate to regard such interventions as ""not yet adequately tested"" rather than demonstrating ""no evidence of efficacy."" Topical aspirin/diethyl ether has not been adequately tested.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The evidence base supports the oral use of tricyclic antidepressants, certain opioids, and gabapentinoids in PHN. Topical therapy with lidocaine patches and capsaicin is similarly supported. Intrathecal administration of methylprednisolone appears to be associated with high efficacy, but its safety requires further evaluation.",2005,,"Hempenstall K, Nurmikko TJ, Johnson RW, A'Hern RP, Rice AS.",https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020164&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) occupies a central position in AD and APP-derived amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are thought to play a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis. Nonetheless, it is becoming clear that AD etiology is highly complex and that factors other than Abeta also contribute to AD pathogenesis. APP intracellular domain (AICD) is generated together with Abeta and we recently showed that AICD transgenic mice recapitulate pathological features of AD such as tau hyperphosphorylation, memory deficits and neurodegeneration without increasing the Abeta levels. Since impaired adult neurogenesis is shown to augment memory deficits in AD mouse models, here we examined the status of adult neurogenesis in AICD transgenic mice.<h4>Methodology/principal finding</h4>We previously generated transgenic mice co-expressing 59-residue long AICD fragment and its binding partner Fe65. Hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation was determined by BrdU incorporation at 1.5, 3 and 12 months of age. Only male transgenic and their respective wilt type littermate control mice were used. We find age-dependent decrease in BrdU incorporation and doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of AICD transgenic mice suggesting impaired adult neurogenesis. This deficit resulted from decreased proliferation and survival, whereas neuronal differentiation remained unaffected. Importantly, this impairment was independent of Abeta since APP-KO mice expressing AICD also exhibit reduced neurogenesis. The defects in adult neurogenesis are prevented by long-term treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents ibuprofen or naproxen suggesting that neuroinflammation is critically involved in impaired adult neurogenesis in AICD transgenic mice.<h4>Conclusion/significance</h4>Since adult neurogenesis is crucial for spatial memory, which is particularly vulnerable in AD, these findings suggest that AICD can exacerbate memory defects in AD by impairing adult neurogenesis. Our findings further establish that AICD, in addition to Abeta, contributes to AD pathology and that neuroinflammation plays a much broader role in AD pathogenesis than previously thought.",2010,,"Ghosal K, Stathopoulos A, Pimplikar SW.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011866,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen is currently used to treat PDA with ductal closure failure rate up to 40%. We test the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 CYP2C8/2C9 polymorphisms may predict ibuprofen response.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>We studied extremely preterm neonates with haemodynamically significant PDA and treated with ibuprofen. One or two variant CYP2C8 and/or 2C9 alleles were found in 17% of the population, most of them were from Caucasian ethnicity (67-74%). Response to ibuprofen and clinical course of infants carrying variants CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 were similar. Comparing infants with wild type or variant CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes, response rate to ibuprofen was significantly higher in wild type than in mutated carriers in univariate analysis (73% versus 52%, p = 0.04). Comparing responders (ductus closure; n = 75) and non-responders (surgical ligation; n = 36), the only two factors significantly associated with the response to ibuprofen using multivariate analysis were higher gestational age and non Caucasian ethnicity but not CYP2C polymorphism.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CYP2C polymorphism was not associated with PDA response to ibuprofen and this factor appears not appropriate to optimize the ductal closure rate by modulating ibuprofen dosing strategy.

Specifically, we examined forearm flexor digitorum muscles for changes in connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; a matrix protein associated with fibrosis), collagen type I (Col1; a matrix component), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1; an upstream modulator of CTGF and collagen), in rats performing one of two repetitive tasks, with or without anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Methodology/results</h4>To examine the roles of force versus repetition, rats performed either a high repetition negligible force food retrieval task (HRNF), or a high repetition high force handle-pulling task (HRHF), for up to 9 weeks, with results compared to trained only (TR-NF or TR-HF) and normal control rats. Grip strength declined with both tasks, with the greatest declines in 9-week HRHF rats. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of HRNF muscles showed increased expression of Col1 in weeks 3-9, and CTGF in weeks 6 and 9. Immunohistochemistry confirmed PCR results, and also showed greater increases of CTGF and collagen matrix in 9-week HRHF rats than 9-week HRNF rats. ELISA, and immunohistochemistry revealed greater increases of TGFB1 in TR-HF and 6-week HRHF, compared to 6-week HRNF rats. To examine the role of inflammation, results from 6-week HRHF rats were compared to rats receiving ibuprofen or anti-TNF-α treatment in HRHF weeks 4-6. Both treatments attenuated HRHF-induced increases in CTGF and fibrosis by 6 weeks of task performance. Ibuprofen attenuated TGFB1 increases and grip strength declines, matching our prior results with anti-TNFα.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Performance of highly repetitive tasks was associated with force-dependent declines in grip strength and increased fibrogenic-related proteins in flexor digitorum muscles.

Most lipases used today originate from mesophilic organisms and are susceptible to thermal denaturation whereas only few possess high thermotolerance. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of two novel thermostable bacterial lipases identified by functional metagenomic screenings. Metagenomic libraries were constructed from enrichment cultures maintained at 65 to 75 °C and screened resulting in the identification of initially 10 clones with lipolytic activities. Subsequently, two ORFs were identified encoding lipases, LipS and LipT. Comparative sequence analyses suggested that both enzymes are members of novel lipase families. LipS is a 30.2 kDa protein and revealed a half-life of 48 h at 70 °C. The lipT gene encoded for a multimeric enzyme with a half-life of 3 h at 70 °C. LipS had an optimum temperature at 70 °C and LipT at 75 °C. Both enzymes catalyzed hydrolysis of long-chain (C(12) and C(14)) fatty acid esters and additionally hydrolyzed a number of industry-relevant substrates. LipS was highly specific for (R)-ibuprofen-phenyl ester with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 99%. Furthermore, LipS was able to synthesize 1-propyl laurate and 1-tetradecyl myristate at 70 °C with rates similar to those of the lipase CalB from Candida antarctica.

We therefore determined oxidative stress in cultured cells and evaluated its occurrence in C57BL/6 mice. Using both cultured neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and macrophage (RAW 264.7) cell lines and also brain tissues of oxaliplatin-treated mice, we investigated whether oxaliplatin (OXA) induces oxidative stress and apoptosis. Cultured cells were treated with 2-200 µM OXA for 24 h. The effects of pharmacological inhibitors of oxidative stress or inflammation (N-acetyl cysteine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) were also tested. Inhibitors were added 30 min before OXA treatment and then in combination with OXA for 24 h. In SH-SY5Y cells, OXA caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in viability, a large increase in ROS and NO production, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial impairment as assessed by a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential, which are deleterious for the cell. An increase in levels of negatively charged phospholipids such as cardiolipin but also phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, was also observed. Additionally, OXA caused concentration-dependent P2X7 receptor activation, increased chromatin condensation and caspase-3 activation associated with TNF-α and IL-6 release. The majority of these toxic effects were equally observed in Raw 264.7 which also presented high levels of PGE2. Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with pharmacological inhibitors significantly reduced or blocked all the neurotoxic OXA effects. In OXA-treated mice (28 mg/kg cumulated dose) significant cold hyperalgesia and oxidative stress in the tested brain areas were shown.

In addition, inflammation often leads to a harmful generation of nitric oxide. Efforts are being done in discovering safer NSAIDs molecules capable of inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and nitric oxide to reduce the side effects associated with long term therapies.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>The analogue of arachidonic acid (AA), 2-hydroxy-arachidonic acid (2OAA), was designed to inhibit the activities of COX1 and COX2 and it was predicted to have similar binding energies as AA for the catalytic sites of COX1 and COX2. The interaction of AA and 2OAA with COX1 and COX2 was investigated calculating the free energy of binding and the Fukui function. Toxicity was determined in mouse microglial BV-2 cells. COX1 and COX2 (PGH2 production) activities were measured in vitro. COX1 and COX2 expression in human macrophage-like U937 cells were carried out by Western blot, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR analysis. NO production (Griess method) and iNOS (Western blot) were determined in mouse microglial BV-2 cells. The comparative efficacy of 2OAA, ibuprofen and cortisone in lowering TNF-α serum levels was determined in C57BL6/J mice challenged with LPS. We show that the presence of the -OH group reduces the likelihood of 2OAA being subjected to H* abstraction in COX, without altering significantly the free energy of binding. The 2OAA inhibited COX1 and COX2 activities and the expression of COX2 in human U937 derived macrophages challenged with LPS. In addition, 2OAA inhibited iNOS expression and the production of NO in BV-2 microglial cells.

Rapaics have shown anti-inflammatory activity, which is strongly influenced by their chemical structures and chain conformations. However, the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect by these polysaccharides have yet to be elucidated. A RG-II polysaccharide (KMPS-2E, Mw 84.8 kDa) was isolated from KMPS and its chemical structure was characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. The backbone of KMPS-2E consisted of units of [→6) -β-D-Galp (1→3)-β-L-Rhap-(1→4)-β-D-GalpA-(1→3)-β-D-Galp-(1→] with the side chain →5)-β-D-Arap (1→3, 5)-β-D-Arap (1→ attached to the backbone through O-4 of (1→3,4)-L-Rhap. T-β-D-Galp is attached to the backbone through O-6 of (1→3,6)-β-D-Galp residues and T-β-D-Ara is connected to the end group of each chain. The anti-inflammatory effects of KMPS-2E and the underlying mechanisms using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema were investigated. KMPS-2E (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) inhibits iNOS, TLR4, phospho-NF-κB-p65 expression, phosphor-IKK, phosphor-IκB-α expression as well as the degradation of IκB-α and the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and IL-6) mediated by the NF-κB signal pathways in macrophages. KMPS-2E also inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-κB as assayed by electrophorectic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in a dose-dependent manner and it reduced NF-κB DNA binding affinity by 62.1% at 200 µg/mL. In rats, KMPS-2E (200 mg/kg) can significantly inhibit carrageenan-induced paw edema as ibuprofen (200 mg/kg) within 3 h after a single oral dose.

The indiscriminate use of antibiotics and other biological drugs are reported to result in thrombocytopenia, which is often neglected during the treatment regime. In addition, augmented oxidative stress induced by drugs and pathological conditions has also been shown to induce thrombocytopenia, which seems to be the most obvious consequence of elevated rate of platelet apoptosis. Thus, blocking oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis would be of prime importance in order to negotiate thrombocytopenia and associated human pathologies. The current study presents the synthesis and platelet protective nature of novel ibuprofen derivatives. The potent anti-oxidant ibuprofen derivative 4f was selected for the study and the platelet protective efficacy and platelet aggregation inhibitory property has been demonstrated. The compound 4f dose dependently mitigates the oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis in both platelet rich plasma and washed platelets. The platelet protective nature of compound 4f was determined by assessing various apoptotic markers such as ROS generation, cytosolic Ca2+ levels, PS externalization, cytochrome C translocation, Caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytotoxicity, LDH leakage and tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins. Furthermore, compound 4f dose dependently ameliorated agonist induced platelet aggregation. Therefore, compound 4f can be estimated as a potential candidate in the treatment regime of pathological disorders associated with platelet activation and apoptosis.

We produced a microneedle formulation with enhanced swelling capabilities from aqueous blends containing 20% w/w Gantrez S-97, 7.5% w/w PEG 10,000 and 3% w/w Na2CO3 and utilised a drug reservoir of a lyophilised wafer-like design. These microneedle-lyophilised wafer compositions were robust and effectively penetrated skin, swelling extensively, but being removed intact. In in vitro delivery experiments across excised neonatal porcine skin, approximately 44 mg of the model high dose small molecule drug ibuprofen sodium was delivered in 24 h, equating to 37% of the loading in the lyophilised reservoir. The super swelling microneedles delivered approximately 1.24 mg of the model protein ovalbumin over 24 h, equivalent to a delivery efficiency of approximately 49%. The integrated microneedle-lyophilised wafer delivery system produced a progressive increase in plasma concentrations of ibuprofen sodium in rats over 6 h, with a maximal concentration of approximately 179 µg/ml achieved in this time. The plasma concentration had fallen to 71±6.7 µg/ml by 24 h. Ovalbumin levels peaked in rat plasma after only 1 hour at 42.36±17.01 ng/ml. Ovalbumin plasma levels then remained almost constant up to 6 h, dropping somewhat at 24 h, when 23.61±4.84 ng/ml was detected.

While achievements were implemented in the intensive care treatment, all attempts within the field of novel therapeutics have failed. As a consequence new medications and improved patient stratification as well as a thoughtful management of the support therapies are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the simultaneous administration of ibuprofen as a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and Pep19-2.5 (Aspidasept), a newly developed antimicrobial peptide. Here, we show a synergistic therapeutic effect of combined Pep19-2.5-ibuprofen treatment in an endotoxemia mouse model of sepsis. In vivo protection correlates with a reduction in plasma levels of both tumor necrosis factor α and prostaglandin E, as a likely consequence of Pep19-2.5 and ibuprofen-dependent blockade of TLR4 and COX pro-inflammatory cascades, respectively. This finding is further characterised and confirmed in a transcriptome analysis of LPS-stimulated human monocytes. The transcriptome analyses showed that Pep19-2.5 and ibuprofen exerted a synergistic global effect both on the number of regulated genes as well as on associated gene ontology and pathway expression.

Historically, phospholipases have been considered to be the primary generator of the arachidonic acid (AA) precursor pool for generating PGE2 and other eicosanoids. However, recent studies have demonstrated that monoacyglycerol lipase (MAGL), through hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, provides a major source of AA for PGE2 synthesis in the mammalian brain under basal and neuroinflammatory states. We show here that either genetic or pharmacological ablation of MAGL leads to significantly reduced fever responses in both centrally or peripherally-administered lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-1β-induced fever models in mice. We also show that a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist does not attenuate these anti-pyrogenic effects of MAGL inhibitors.

For glioma, research has generally focused on diclofenac; however data on other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, is limited. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the cellular, molecular, and metabolic effects of ibuprofen and diclofenac on human glioblastoma cells.<h4>Methods</h4>Glioma cell lines were treated with ibuprofen or diclofenac to investigate functional effects on proliferation and cell motility. Cell cycle, extracellular lactate levels, lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) expression and activity, as well as inhibition of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT-3) signaling pathway, were determined. Specific effects of diclofenac and ibuprofen on STAT-3 were investigated by comparing their effects with those of the specific STAT-3 inhibitor STATTIC.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen treatment led to a stronger inhibition of cell growth and migration than treatment with diclofenac. Proliferation was affected by cell cycle arrest at different checkpoints by both agents. In addition, diclofenac, but not ibuprofen, decreased lactate levels in all concentrations used. Both decreased STAT-3 phosphorylation; however, diclofenac led to decreased c-myc expression and subsequent reduction in LDH-A activity, whereas treatment with ibuprofen in higher doses induced c-myc expression and less LDH-A alteration.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study indicates that both ibuprofen and diclofenac strongly inhibit glioma cells, but the subsequent metabolic responses of both agents are distinct. We postulate that ibuprofen may inhibit tumor cells also by COX- and lactate-independent mechanisms after long-term treatment in physiological dosages, whereas diclofenac mainly acts by inhibition of STAT-3 signaling and downstream modulation of glycolysis.",2015,,"Leidgens V, Seliger C, Jachnik B, Welz T, Leukel P, Vollmann-Zwerenz A, Bogdahn U, Kreutz M, Grauer OM, Hau P.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140613,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The most common drugs used to relieve these symptoms are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are not typically considered antibiotics. Here, we investigate the effects of NSAIDs on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and the modulation of bacterial efflux pumps.<h4>Methodology</h4>The activity of 12 NSAID active substances, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and eight relevant medicinal products was analyzed with or without pump inhibitors against 89 strains of Gram-negative rods by determining the MICs. Furthermore, the effects of NSAIDs on the susceptibility of clinical strains to antimicrobial agents with or without PAβN (Phe-Arg-β-naphtylamide) were measured.<h4>Results</h4>The MICs of diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen, in the presence of PAβN, were significantly (≥4-fold) reduced, decreasing to 25-1600 mg/L, against the majority of the studied strains. In the case of acetylsalicylic acid only for 5 and 7 out of 12 strains of P. mirabilis and E. coli, respectively, a 4-fold increase in susceptibility in the presence of PAβN was observed. The presence of Aspirin resulted in a 4-fold increase in the MIC of ofloxacin against only two strains of E. coli among 48 tested clinical strains, which included species such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. maltophilia. Besides, the medicinal products containing the following NSAIDs, diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen, did not cause the decrease of clinical strains' susceptibility to antibiotics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The effects of PAβN on the susceptibility of bacteria to NSAIDs indicate that some NSAIDs are substrates for efflux pumps in Gram-negative rods.

The in vitro antifungal activities of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp. were recently discovered. In the present study, the in vitro interactions between three NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium) and commonly used antifungal agents (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B) against planktonic and biofilm cells of T. asahii were evaluated using the checkerboard microdilution method. The spectrophotometric method and the XTT reduction assay were used to generate data on biofilm cells. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) and the ΔE model were compared to interpret drug interactions. Using the FICI, the highest percentages of synergistic effects against planktonic cells (86.67%) and biofilm cells (73.33%) were found for amphotericin B/ibuprofen, and caspofungin/ibuprofen showed appreciable percentages (73.33% for planktonic form and 60.00% for biofilm) as well. We did not observe antagonism. The ΔE model gave consistent results with FICI (86.67%). Our findings suggest that amphotericin B/ibuprofen and caspofungin/ibuprofen combinations have potential effects against T. asahii.

Drug repurposing has become of increasing interest to improve standard therapy. Statins and NSAIDs inhibit glioma cell growth in vitro and in vivo, but data on statin and NSAID treatment in relation to survival of patients with HGG are sparse.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed multivariable adjusted Cox-regression analyses among 1,093 patients with HGG from a regional cancer registry to obtain Hazard Ratios (HRs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) according to treatment with statins or NSAIDs. Data on dose and duration of treatment was mostly lacking in our analysis, therefore we were not able to perform dose-response analyses.<h4>Results</h4>Use of statins was unrelated to OS or PFS of glioma patients. Use of aspirin was associated with prolonged OS and PFS in patients with WHO grade III, but not WHO grade IV glioma. Use of other NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen) or non-NSAID analgesics (paracetamol) was mostly unrelated to survival of glioma patients. Use of selective COX-2 inhibitors and metamizol was related to inferior patient survival in parts of the analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Use of statins or NSAIDS, including aspirin, was not associated with prolonged OS or PFS of patients with WHO grade IV glioma in our selected cohort. There was an indication for improved survival in patients with WHO grade III glioma using aspirin, but further studies are needed to confirm our first observation.",2018,,"Seliger C, Schaertl J, Gerken M, Luber C, Proescholdt M, Riemenschneider MJ, Leitzmann MF, Hau P, Klinkhammer-Schalke M.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207858&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study investigated the effect of ibuprofen (IBU) and triclosan (TCS), alone and in combination to the performance and enzymatic activity of AS bacterial community. The assays were carried out in a pilot AS reactor operating for two-weeks under continuous dosage of pollutants. The microbial activity was tracked by measuring oxygen uptake rate, esterase activity, oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities. It was found that IBU and TCS had no acute toxic effects on reactor biomass concentration. TCS led to significant decrease of COD removal efficiency, which dropped from 90% to 35%. Continuous exposure to IBU, TCS and their mixtures increased the activities of glutathione s-transferase (GST) and esterase as a response to oxidative damage. A high increase in GST activity was associated with non-reversible toxic damage while peaks of esterase activity combined with moderate GST increase were attributed to an adaptive response.",2020,,"Amariei G, Boltes K, Rosal R, Leton P.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227267,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study employed single cell and population imaging to investigate drug-induced perturbations of leading edge pseudopod morphology in cultured, polarized RAW macrophages. The drugs tested included representative therapeutics (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) as well as control drugs (PDGF, Gö6976, wortmannin). Notably, slow addition of any of the four therapeutics to cultured macrophages, mimicking the slowly increasing plasma concentration reported for standard oral dosage in patients, yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology. This finding is consistent with the well established clinical safety of these drugs. However, rapid drug addition to cultured macrophages revealed four distinct classes of effects on the leading edge pseudopod: (i) non-perturbing drug exposures yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac); (ii) adaptive exposures yielded temporary collapse of the extended pseudopod and its signature PI(3,4,5)P3 lipid signal followed by slow recovery of extended pseudopod morphology (ibuprofen, acetaminophen); (iii) disruptive exposures yielded long-term pseudopod collapse (Gö6976, wortmannin); and (iv) activating exposures yielded pseudopod expansion (PDGF). The novel observation of adaptive exposures leads us to hypothesize that rapid addition of an adaptive drug overwhelms an intrinsic or extrinsic adaptation system yielding temporary collapse followed by adaptive recovery, while slow addition enables gradual adaptation to counteract the drug perturbation in real time. Overall, the results illustrate an approach that may help identify therapeutic drugs that temporarily inhibit the leading edge pseudopod during extreme inflammation events, and toxic drugs that yield long term inhibition of the pseudopod with negative consequences for innate immunity. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of drug-induced pseudopod collapse, as well as the mechanisms of adaptation and recovery following some inhibitory drug exposures.",2020,,"Buckles TC, Ziemba BP, Djukovic D, Falke JJ.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233012&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

While there is mounting evidence that in vitro diffusion studies in mammalian skin can provide valid information regarding likely in vivo absorption, little is known whether such a correlation exists between in vitro diffusion testing and in vivo blood levels in amphibians. The current study used previously-reported in vitro absorption data for caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen across isolated skin from the cane toad (Rhinella marina) to produce a series of linear mixed-effect models of the absorption parameters flux and permeability coefficient (Kp). Models investigated the relative impacts of animal weight, physicochemical characteristics of the applied chemical (logP or molecular weight), and site of application. The top models were then used to predict the flux, Kp and serum concentrations of the same three model chemicals. Finally, the absorption of these chemicals was determined in live cane toads, and results compared to the model predictions. LogP and site of application were included in all top models. In vivo absorption rates were lower than predicted for all chemicals, however, the models provided reasonable predictions of serum concentration, with factors of difference (FOD) ranging from 2.5-10.5. Ibuprofen, the chemical with the highest relative lipophilicity, had the poorest predictive performance, consistently having the highest FOD for all predictions. This report presents the first models of percutaneous absorption in an amphibian. These models provide a basic method to establish the approximate in vivo absorption of hydrophilic and moderately-lipophilic chemicals through frog skin, and could therefore be used to predict absorption when formulating such chemicals for treatment of disease in frogs, or for risk-assessments regarding chemical pollutants in frog habitats.",2020,,"Llewelyn VK, Berger L, Glass BD.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235737,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

BRSV causes a respiratory syndrome in calves, which is associated with severe bronchiolitis. In this study we describe the effect of treatment with antiviral fusion protein inhibitor (FPI) and ibuprofen, on gene expression in lung tissue of calves infected with BRSV. Calves infected with BRSV are an excellent model of human RSV in infants: we hypothesized that FPI in combination with ibuprofen would provide the best therapeutic intervention for both species. The following experimental treatment groups of BRSV infected calves were used: 1) ibuprofen day 3-10, 2) ibuprofen day 5-10, 3) placebo, 4) FPI day 5-10, 5) FPI and ibuprofen day 5-10, 6) FPI and ibuprofen day 3-10. All calves were infected with BRSV on day 0. Daily clinical evaluation with monitoring of virus shedding by qRT-PCR was conducted. On day10 lung tissue with lesions (LL) and non-lesional (LN) was collected at necropsy, total RNA extracted, and RNA sequencing performed. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted with Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The most significant differential gene expression in BRSV infected lung tissues was observed in the comparison of LL with LN; oxidative stress and cell damage was especially noticeable. Innate and adaptive immune functions were reduced in LL. As expected, combined treatment with FPI and Ibuprofen, when started early, made the most difference in gene expression patterns in comparison with placebo, especially in pathways related to the innate and adaptive immune response in both LL and LN. Ibuprofen, when used alone, negatively affected the antiviral response and caused higher virus loads as shown by increased viral shedding. In contrast, when used with FPI Ibuprofen enhanced the specific antiviral effect of FPI, due to its ability to reduce the damaging effect of prostanoids and oxidative stress.",2021,,"Lebedev M, McEligot HA, Mutua VN, Walsh P, Carvallo Chaigneau FR, Gershwin LJ.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246695&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The shared characteristic these diseases feature is their uncontrollable fibrogenesis deemed responsible for the accumulated damage in the susceptible tissues. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, an interstitial lung disease, is one of the most common and studied fibrotic diseases and still remains an active research target. In this study we highlight unique and common (i) genes, (ii) biological pathways and (iii) candidate repurposed drugs among 9 fibrotic diseases. We identify 7 biological pathways involved in all 9 fibrotic diseases as well as pathways unique to some of these diseases. Based on our Drug Repurposing results, we suggest captopril and ibuprofen that both appear to slow the progression of fibrotic diseases according to existing bibliography. We also recommend nafcillin and memantine, which haven't been studied against fibrosis yet, for further wet-lab experimentation. We also observe a group of cardiomyopathy-related pathways that are exclusively highlighted for Oral Submucous Fibrosis. We suggest digoxin to be tested against Oral Submucous Fibrosis, since we observe cardiomyopathy-related pathways implicated in Oral Submucous Fibrosis and there is bibliographic evidence that digoxin may potentially clear myocardial fibrosis. Finally, we establish that Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis shares several involved genes, biological pathways and candidate inhibiting-drugs with Dupuytren's Disease, IgG4-related Disease, Systemic Sclerosis and Cystic Fibrosis.

In vertebrates and corals, COX must be N-glycosylated on at least two asparagine residues in the N-(X)-S/T motif to be catalytically active. Although COX glycosylation requirement is well-characterized in many species, whether crustacean COXs require N-glycosylation for their enzymatic function have not been investigated. In this study, a 1,842-base pair cox gene was obtained from ovarian cDNA of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon. Sequence analysis revealed that essential catalytic residues and putative catalytic domains of P. monodon COX (PmCOX) were well-conserved in relation to other vertebrate and crustacean COXs. Expression of PmCOX in 293T cells increased levels of secreted PGE2 and PGF2α up to 60- and 77-fold, respectively, compared to control cells. Incubation of purified PmCOX with endoglycosidase H, which cleaves oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins, reduced the molecular mass of PmCOX. Similarly, addition of tunicamycin, which inhibits N-linked glycosylation, in PmCOX-expressing cells resulted in PmCOX protein with lower molecular mass than those obtained from untreated cells, suggesting that PmCOX was N-glycosylated. Three potential glycosylation sites of PmCOX were identified at N79, N170 and N424. Mutational analysis revealed that although all three residues were glycosylated, only mutations at N170 and N424 completely abolished catalytic function. Inhibition of COX activity by ibuprofen treatment also decreased the levels of PGE2 in shrimp haemolymph. This study not only establishes the presence of the COX enzyme in penaeid shrimp, but also reveals that N-glycosylation sites are highly conserved and required for COX function in crustaceans.",2021,,"Tobwor P, Deenarn P, Pruksatrakul T, Jiemsup S, Yongkiettrakul S, Vichai V, Phromson M, Chaiyapechara S, Jangsutthivorawat W, Yotbuntueng P, Hargreaves OG, Wimuttisuk W.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250276,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Evidence indicates that a higher temperature during the acute illness is a risk factor for post-infectious neurologic sequelae. As such, aggressive antipyretic therapy may be warranted among children with complicated malaria at substantial risk of brain injury. Previous clinical trials conducted primarily in children with uncomplicated malaria and using only a single antipyretic medication have shown limited benefits in terms of fever reduction; however, no studies to date have examined malaria fever management using dual therapies. In this clinical trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy, children hospitalized with central nervous system (CNS) malaria will be randomized to usual care (acetaminophen every 6 hours for a temperature ≥ 38.5°C) vs. prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen every 6 hours for 72 hours.<h4>Methods</h4>In this double-blinded, placebo controlled, two-armed clinical trial, we will enroll 284 participants from three settings at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi; at the University Teaching Hospitals Children's Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and at Chipata Central Hospital, Chipata, Zambia. Parents or guardians must provide written informed consent. Eligible participants are 2-11 years with evidence of P. falciparum malaria infection by peripheral blood smear or rapid diagnostic test with CNS symptoms associated with malaria. Eligible children will receive treatment allocation randomization either to standard of care for fever management or to prophylactic, scheduled treatment every 6 hours for 72 hours with dual antipyretic therapies using acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Assignment to treatment groups will be with 1:1 allocation using blocked randomization. The primary outcome will be maximum temperature in the 72 hours after enrolment. Secondary outcomes include parasite clearance as determined by quantitative Histidine Rich Protein II and seizures through 72 hours after enrolment.<h4>Discussion</h4>This clinical trial seeks to challenge the practice paradigm of limited fever treatment based upon hyperpyrexia by evaluating the fever-reduction efficacy of more aggressive antipyretic using two antipyretics and prophylactic administration and will elucidate the impact of antipyretics on parasite clearance and acute symptomatic seizures. If aggressive antipyretic therapy is shown to safely reduce the maximum temperature, a clinical trial evaluating the neuroprotective effects of temperature reduction in CNS malaria is warranted.",2022,,"Chilombe MB, McDermott MP, Seydel KB, Mathews M, Mwenechanya M, Birbeck GL.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268414&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Forty-two patient profiles were generated, with varying levels of albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), age, and PromarkerD result. A web-based survey asked each physician to make monitoring/treatment decisions about eight randomly selected profiles. Data were analyzed using multivariable logit models.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred three primary care physicians and 197 endocrinologists completed the survey. PromarkerD result was most important for increasing the frequency of risk factor monitoring. PromarkerD was second to HbA1c in importance for deciding to prescribe sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2s) with a DKD indication, second to blood pressure for increasing the dose of lisinopril, and second to eGFR for replacing ibuprofen with a non-nephrotoxic medication. Compared with no PromarkerD results, a high-risk PromarkerD result was associated with significantly higher odds of increasing monitoring frequency (odds ratio [OR]: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.90-3.45), prescribing SGLT2s (OR: 1.98 [1.56-2.52]), increasing lisinopril dose (OR: 1.48 [1.17-1.87]), and replacing ibuprofen (OR: 1.78 [1.32-2.40]).

Analysis will compare the odds of any brain injury between the aggressive antipyretic therapy and usual care groups based upon MRI structural abnormalities. For children unable to undergo imaging without deep sedation, neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes will be used to identify brain injury.<h4>Discussion</h4>Neuroimaging is a well-established, valid proxy for neurological outcomes after brain injury in pediatric CNS malaria.

This study focuses on elucidating the impact of the NSAID ibuprofen (IBU) on cancer cells exposed to hypoxia, as the hypoxic microenvironment significantly influences tumor progression, metastatic potential, and therapy resistance. Given that carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a key hypoxia-associated protein and a promising therapeutic target due to its tumor-specific expression, we primarily examined the impact of IBU on CA IX and the transcription factors regulating CA IX expression. We found that IBU downregulates expression and protein level of CA IX in hypoxic colon carcinoma and head and neck cancer cells, resulting in a reduction of membranous CA IX. To elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon, we analyzed the key CA IX-regulating transcription factor HIF-1 and found decreased levels of the HIF-1α subunit in IBU-treated cells, leading to its impaired binding to the CA9 promotor. Analysis of another transcription factor involved in CA IX expression, NFκB, showed suppressed NFκB pathway under IBU treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated IBU-mediated induction in apoptosis in cancer cells, as well as a decrease in their ability to migrate. Our study is the first to demonstrate that ibuprofen downregulates carbonic anhydrase IX expression in hypoxic colon and head and neck tumor cells by decreasing HIF-1α levels. Additionally, ibuprofen impairs key transcription factors NFκB and STAT3, leading to reduced adaptation to hypoxic stress, decreased tumor cell viability, and migration. This indicates its potential as a therapeutic agent in combination therapy for colon carcinoma or head and neck cancer.",2025,,"Grossmannova K, Belvoncikova P, Puzderova B, Simko V, Csaderova L, Pastorek J, Barathova M.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0323635,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

(coriander) has long been valued for its culinary and medicinal uses. <i>C. sativum</i> essential oil (CsEO), particularly linalool-rich chemotypes, exhibits diverse biological activities; however, integrated evaluations encompassing neurological, inflammatory, and molecular targets remain limited. This study aimed to chemically characterize Peruvian CsEO and assess its anticonvulsant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, alongside those of pure linalool, while elucidating potential mechanisms through cytokine modulation and molecular docking of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>CsEO was extracted from Peruvian coriander seeds through steam distillation and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antioxidant activity was quantified using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assay. Anticonvulsant effects were tested in BALB/c mice using the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure model, analgesic activity through the acetic acid-induced writhing test, and anti-inflammatory effects in Holtzman rats using the carrageenan-induced paw edema model. Serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Molecular docking evaluated linalool's binding affinity to COX-1 and COX-2 relative to standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Results</h4>GC-MS identified linalool as the major constituent (59.80%), alongside α-pinene (8.65%), camphor (8.48%), and γ-terpinene (7.09%). CsEO demonstrated potent antioxidant activity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>] = 32.04 μg/mL), exceeding that of linalool alone (IC<sub>50</sub> = 152.29 μg/mL). Significant anticonvulsant effects occurred at 200 mg/kg for both CsEO and linalool, increasing seizure latency by up to 87.20% and reducing seizure frequency by ~43%. In analgesic assays, linalool (200 mg/kg) achieved a 93.80% writhing reduction, comparable to tramadol, while CsEO showed strong but slightly lower efficacy. CsEO (200 mg/kg) inhibited carrageenan-induced edema by 51.35% at 4 h, reduced IL-1β by 49.8%, and IL-6 by 26.5%, effects comparable to ibuprofen. Docking revealed moderate linalool affinity for COX-1 (-5.70 kcal/mol) and COX-2 (-6.10 kcal/mol), sharing key hydrophobic interactions with reference drugs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Peruvian CsEO, characterized by a distinctive linalool-rich chemotype, exhibits significant multi-target pharmacological activities, with synergistic contributions from minor constituents enhancing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Its integrated efficacy profile and favorable safety indicators highlight CsEO as a promising phytotherapeutic candidate for managing seizures, pain, and inflammation.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficiency of oral premedication with Aceclofenac (immediate release and controlled release) in the management of post-instrumentation pain in root canal treatment, in patients with moderate to severe preoperative pain.<h4>Methods</h4>Three-arm parallel, triple blinded randomized controlled trial was planned. Patients with moderate to severe endodontic pain, requiring primary endodontic treatment were enrolled. Aceclofenac 100mg- immediate release (Aceclofenac-IR), Aceclofenac 200mg- controlled release (Aceclofenac-CR), and Ibuprofen 400mg were compared. The tablets were given one hour before the root canal treatment. Postoperatively, patients rated their pain at various time points. The duration of pain relief (primary outcome), the intensity of post-instrumentation pain, and the need for additional medicine were calculated. Statistical analysis was done using Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn post-hoc, Chi-square tests, and Binominal logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>Aceclofenac-CR had a statistically significant longest duration of pain relief when compared to Ibuprofen (p=0.037) and Aceclofenac-IR (p=0.026). The intensity of post-instrumentation pain was lowest in Aceclofenac-CR, followed by Aceclofenac-IR and Ibuprofen. Additional medicine was required for only 8% of patients in Aceclofenac-CR group; whereas for 32% in each of Aceclofenac-IR and Ibuprofen groups. The odds of taking additional medicine were reduced to 0.16 in Aceclofenac-CR; increased to 1.05 with age.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Aceclofenac-CR had the longest duration of pain relief compared to Aceclofenac-IR and Ibuprofen.

Infe-rior alveolar nerve blocks are eight times more likely to fail in patients with irreversible pulpitis. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of lignocaine with and without pre-operative oral ibuprofen for controlling pain in primary mandibular molars scheduled for pulpectomy procedures in 5 to 9-year-old children.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and twenty-two children diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis in mandibular posterior teeth and scheduled for pulpectomy procedures were included. The children were assigned to one of the two groups, Treatment group A: Pre-operative with oral ibuprofen and local anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine (with adrenaline 1: 80000); Treatment group B: Pre-operative with oral placebo and local anaesthesia with 2% ligno-caine (with 1: 80000 adrenaline). Pain and pulse rate were recorded at baseline, one hour after administration of oral medication, fifteen minutes following administration of Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block (IANB), and also during the course pulpectomy. The results were statistically analysed using chi square test and repeated mea-sures analysis of variance (ANOVA).<h4>Results</h4>In treatment group A, 90.16% children had IANB success compared to 9.83% in group B.. The differ-ence in the success rate between two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001) with an odds ratio of 84.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Oral medication with ibuprofen is effective in increasing the success rate of IANB with lignocaine for the treatment of irreversible pulpitis of 5 to 9-year-old children.",2024,,"Gandhi Z, Nagaraj Gowda SH.",https://doi.org/10.14744/eej.2023.18480,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We hypothesized that obese individuals would have greater indices of inflammation compared with lean controls, and that cyclooxygenase inhibition using ibuprofen would reduce muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and increase forearm blood flow in these subjects. We measured MSNA, inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and Interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and forearm vasodilator responses to brachial artery acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside in 13 men and women (7 lean; 6 obese) on two separate study days: control (CON) and after 800 mg ibuprofen (IBU).

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a stress signalling transcription factor that regulates acute and chronic states of inflammation. The classical NF-κB pathway regulates the early activation of post-exercise inflammation; however there remains scope for this complex transcription factor to play a more detailed role in post-exercise muscle recovery. Sixteen volunteers completed a bout of lower body resistance exercise with the ingestion of three 400 mg doses of ibuprofen or a placebo control. Muscle biopsy samples were obtained prior to exercise and at 0, 3 and 24 h post-exercise and analysed for key markers of NF-κB activity. Phosphorylated p65 protein expression and p65 inflammatory target genes were elevated immediately post-exercise independent of the two treatments. These changes did not translate to an increase in p65 DNA binding activity. NF-κB p50 protein expression and NF-κB p50 binding activity were lower than pre-exercise at 0 and 3 h post-exercise, but were elevated at 24 h post-exercise. These findings provide novel evidence that two distinct NF-κB pathways are active in skeletal muscle after resistance exercise. The initial wave of activity involving p65 resembles the classical pathway and is associated with the onset of an acute inflammatory response. The second wave of NF-κB activity comprises the p50 subunit, which has been previously shown to resolve an acute inflammatory program. The current study showed no effect of the ibuprofen treatment on markers of the NF-κB pathway, however examination of the within group effects of the exercise protocol suggests that this pathway warrants further research.",2014,,"Vella L, Markworth JF, Peake JM, Snow RJ, Cameron-Smith D, Russell AP.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.14814/phy2.12172,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, there is no evidence for its use after ambulatory surgery. Our aim was to test whether auricular acupuncture is better than invasive needle control for complementary analgesia after ambulatory knee surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and twenty patients undergoing ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery under standardized general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive auricular acupuncture or a control procedure. Fixed indwelling acupuncture needles were inserted before surgery and retained in situ until the following morning. Postoperative rescue analgesia was directed to achieve pain intensity less than 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative requirement for ibuprofen between surgery and examination the following morning.<h4>Results</h4>Intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients from the control group (n = 59) required more ibuprofen than patients from the auricular acupuncture group (n = 61): median (interquartile range) 600 (200-800) v. 200 (0-600) mg (p = 0.012). Pain intensity on a visual analogue scale was similar in both groups at all time points registered.

While nutrient removal in wetlands has been extensively investigated, information regarding the degradation of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has only recently been emerging. PPCPs are widely distributed in urban wastewaters and can be removed to some extent by the constructed wetlands. The medium-term (3-5 years) behavior of these systems regarding PPCP removal is still unknown.<h4>Objectives</h4>The efficiency of a Leca-based laboratory-scale constructed wetland planted with <i>Phragmites australis</i> (Cav.) Trin. Ex. Steudel in treating an aqueous solution of the pharmaceuticals, namely, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine, was to investigate.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The two pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CW) were operated in parallel; one as an experimental unit (a planted reactor with <i>P. australis</i>) and the other as a control (an unplanted reactor with Leca). Pretreatment and analyses of the carbamazepine, ibuprofen, sulfadiazine, and tissue samples (Leca, <i>P. australis</i> body and <i>P.australis</i> leaf) were conducted using HPLC.<h4>Results</h4>The carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine removal efficiencies for the planted and unplanted reactors were 89.23% and 95.94%, 89.50% and 94.73%, and 67.20% and 93.68%, respectively. The Leca bed permitted an efficient removal. Leca has a high sorption capacity for these pharmaceuticals, with removal efficiencies of 93.68-95.94% in the unplanted reactors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sorption processes might be of a major importance in achieving efficient treatment of wastewater, particularly in the removal of organic material that are resistant to biodegradation, in which case the materials composing the support matrix may play an important role.

However, it remains unclear whether opioid analgesia would enhance the opioid rewarding effect thereby contributing to opioid rewarding. Utilizing a rat paradigm of conditioned place preference (CPP) combined with ankle monoarthritis as a condition of persistent nociception, we showed that analgesia induced by either morphine or the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen increased CPP scores in arthritic rats, suggesting that analgesia itself had a rewarding effect. However, arthritic rats exhibited a significantly higher CPP score in response to morphine than ibuprofen. Thus, the rewarding effect of morphine was enhanced in the presence of persistent nociception, producing a phenomenon of analgesia-enhanced opioid reward. At the cellular level, administration of morphine activated a cascade of leptin expression, glial activation, and dopamine receptor upregulation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), while administration of ibuprofen decreased glial activation with no effect on leptin expression in the NAc. Furthermore, the morphine rewarding effect was blocked in leptin deficient ob/ob mice or by neutralizing leptin or interleukin-1β in the NAc without diminishing morphine analgesia. The data indicate that systemic opioid can activate a leptin-mediated central mechanism in the NAc that led to the enhanced opioid rewarding effect.

This contrasts with most other common oral irritants, such as cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin, and alcohol, which irritate mucus membranes throughout the oral cavity. Here, we show that this rare irritation pattern is a consequence of both the specificity of oleocanthal for a single sensory receptor and the anatomical restriction of this sensory receptor to the pharynx, within the oral cavity. We demonstrate, in vitro, that oleocanthal selectively activates the hTRPA1 channel in HEK 293 cells and that its ability to excite the trigeminal nervous system in rodents requires a functional TRPA1. Moreover, we similarly demonstrate that the over-the-counter analgesic, ibuprofen, which elicits the same restricted pharyngeal irritation as oleocanthal, also specifically excites rodent sensory neurons via TRPA1. Using human sensory psychophysical studies and immunohistochemical TRPA1 analyses of human oral and nasal tissues, we observe an overlap of the anatomical distribution of TRPA1 and the regions irritated by oleocanthal in humans. These results suggest that a TRPA1 (ANKTM1) gene product mediates the tissue sensitivity to oleocanthal within the oral cavity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite the fact that oleocanthal possesses the classic electrophilic reactivity of many TRPA1 agonists, it does not use the previously identified activation mechanism via covalent cysteine modification. These findings provide an anatomical and molecular explanation for a distinct oral sensation that is elicited by oleocanthal and ibuprofen and that is commonly experienced around the world when consuming many extra-virgin olive oils.",2011,,"Peyrot des Gachons C, Uchida K, Bryant B, Shima A, Sperry JB, Dankulich-Nagrudny L, Tominaga M, Smith AB, Beauchamp GK, Breslin PA.",http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/3/999,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Expression of iNOS can be induced in cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) in vivo as well as in vitro, allowing these cells to be used to study regulation of neuronal iNOS expression. We report here that microinjection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma into rat cerebellum induced iNOS expression in CGCs and subsequent cell death assessed by staining for DNA fragmentation. Co-injection of three structurally distinct agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), including the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione troglitazone, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen, and the prostanoid 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) prostaglandin J(2), reduced both iNOS expression and cell death, whereas co-injection of the selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor NS-398 had no effect.

This reduction was associated with a dramatic increase in the number of microglia expressing major histocompatibility complex-II antigen, a marker for microglial activation. In contrast, ibuprofen at 375 ppm in diet caused modest reductions in Abeta load but not Congo red staining, suggesting that the effects of this nonselective NSAID were restricted primarily to nonfibrillar deposits. We detected no effects of the cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAID celecoxib at 175 ppm on amyloid deposition. In short-term studies of 12-month-old Tg mice, we found that the microglia-activating properties of NCX-2216 (7.5 mg small middle dot kg(-1) small middle dot d(-1), s.c.) were present after 2 weeks of treatment. Microglia were not activated by NCX-2216 in non-Tg mice lacking Abeta deposits, nor were microglia activated in Tg animals by flurbiprofen (5 mg small middle dot kg(-1) small middle dot d(-1)) alone. These data are consistent with the argument that activated microglia can clear Abeta deposits. We conclude that the NO-generating component of NCX-2216 confers biological actions that go beyond those of typical NSAIDs. In conclusion, NCX-2216 is more efficacious than ibuprofen or celecoxib in clearing Abeta deposits from the brains of Tg mice, implying potential benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia.",2002,,"Jantzen PT, Connor KE, DiCarlo G, Wenk GL, Wallace JL, Rojiani AM, Coppola D, Morgan D, Gordon MN.",http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/22/6/2246,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The growth inhibitions from CNS myelin and astroglial chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans partially account for the lack of CNS repair. Here, we show that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and indomethacin, the drugs widely used as pain relievers in the clinic, can surmount axon growth restrictions from myelin and proteoglycans by potently inhibiting their downstream pathway RhoA signal. Similar to Rho and Rock inhibitors C3 transferase or Y27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide], both NSAID drugs stimulate a significant neurite growth in the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to the inhibitory substrates. Systemic administration of ibuprofen to spinal cord-lesioned rodents reverses the active RhoA signal around injury area measured via Rho-GTP binding assay. Subcutaneous injections of ibuprofen via minipumps to rats with a thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injury result in substantial corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery, even delaying the treatment 1 week after trauma. In contrast, the non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have the axon growth-promoting effects on cultured or lesioned neurons. These studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs in treating CNS injuries characterized by axonal disconnection including spinal cord injury.",2007,,"Fu Q, Hue J, Li S.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/27/15/4154.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,20089905,20089905.0,10.1523/jneurosci.5045-09.2010,A molecular mechanism for ibuprofen-mediated RhoA inhibition in neurons.,"Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used to relieve pain and inflammation in many disorders via inhibition of cyclooxygenases. Recently, we have demonstrated that ibuprofen inhibits intracellular signaling of RhoA and promotes significant axonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. In addition, another study suggests that ibuprofen reduces generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signaling, although it may also regulate amyloid-beta42 formation by direct inhibition of the gamma-secretase complex. The molecular mechanisms by which ibuprofen inhibits the RhoA signal in neurons, however, remain unclear. Here, we report that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is essential for coupling ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition and subsequent neurite growth promotion in neurons. Ibuprofen activates PPARgamma in neuron-like PC12 and B104 cells. Activation of PPARgamma with traditional agonists mimics the RhoA-inhibiting properties of ibuprofen in PC12 cells and, like ibuprofen, promotes neurite elongation in primary cultured neurons exposed to axonal growth inhibitors. Protein knockdown with small interfering RNA specific for PPARgamma blocks RhoA suppression of PPARgamma agonists in PC12 cells. Moreover, the effect of ibuprofen on RhoA activity and neurite growth in neuronal cultures is prevented by selective PPARgamma inhibition. These findings support that PPARgamma plays an essential role in mediating the RhoA-inhibiting effect of ibuprofen. Elucidation of the novel molecular mechanisms linking ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition may provide additional therapeutic targets to the disorders characterized by RhoA activation, including spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's disease.",2010,,"Dill J, Patel AR, Yang XL, Bachoo R, Powell CM, Li S.",http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/30/3/963.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Workup was initiated, and a diagnosis of central precocious puberty was confirmed. A decision was made to initiate pubertal blockade using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) therapy with depot leuprolide acetate injections every 3 months. The patient received the first depot leuprolide acetate injection in the right ventrogluteal area. Six hours following the injection, the patient was reported to be inconsolable in pain, which was localized to the right hip site of the earlier injection and associated with a refusal to ambulate. The pain and discomfort continued to progress over the next 24 h despite an alternating regimen of Tylenol and ibuprofen prompting admission to the emergency department. Vital signs demonstrated a low-grade fever and elevated C-reactive protein. An ultrasound of the right hip demonstrated fluid accumulation within the joint. Over the next week, the patient was unable to walk independently and required assistance for activities of daily living. By 2 weeks after the injection, the pain began to remit, and the patient resumed activities of daily living. Following consultation with allergy, a decision was made to continue GnRHa suppressive therapy with an alternative analog (Triptodur). The patient tolerated subsequent treatment without reaction.<h4>Learning points</h4>Although gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have a generally good safety profile, there is a history of both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions associated with their use. Despite the long-acting formulation of depot leuprolide acetate, the systemic reaction in this case appears to be self-limited. Discontinuation of therapy or a change to an alternative formulation of GnRHa analog should be considered based on the need for therapy versus the potential risk of rechallenge.",2024,,"Steen EA, Phillips SA.",https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-24-0031,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Drug discovery and delivery to retard the degeneration of joint tissues are challenging. Current treatment of different types of arthritis such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis involves the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, diclofenac, aceclofenac, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, indomethacin piroxicam, dexibuprofen, ketoprofen, nabumetone, nimesulide, and naproxen, mainly by the oral, parenteral, or topical route.

We found that NSAIDs including celecoxib (CCB) and ibuprofen (IBU) significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity of Hsp90 inhibitors in human multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells expressing high levels of mutant p53 (mutp53) protein and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and reversed Hsp90 inhibitor resistance caused by activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and by up-regulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and P-gp. Inhibition of Akt/mTOR and STAT3 pathways by CCB induced autophagy, which promoted the degradation of mutp53, one of Hsp90 client proteins, and subsequently down-regulated HSF1/Hsps and P-gp. Inhibition of autophagy prevented mutp53 degradation and CCB-induced apoptosis, and inhibition of caspase-3-mediated apoptotic pathway by Z-DEVD-FMK did not completely block CCB-induced cell death in MDR cells, suggesting that autophagic and apoptotic cell death may contribute to CCB-induced cytotoxicity in MDR cells. Furthermore, CCB and IBU suppressed Hsp90 inhibitor-induced HSF1/Hsp70/P-gp activity and mutp53 expression in MDR cells.

Although the molecular mechanism behind the antitumor properties of NSAIDs has been largely attributed to inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COXs), several studies have shown that the chemopreventive properties of ibuprofen also involve multiple COX-independent effects. One example is its ability to inhibit the alternative splicing event generating RAC1B, which is overexpressed in a specific subset of BRAF-mutated colorectal tumors and sustains cell survival. Here we describe the mechanism by which ibuprofen prevents RAC1B alternative splicing in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line: it leads to decreased translocation of SRPK1 and SRSF1 to the nucleus and is regulated by a WNK1/GSK3β/SRPK1 protein kinase complex. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that ibuprofen does not inhibit the activity of any of the involved kinases but rather promotes disassembly of this regulatory complex, exposing GSK3β serine 9 to inhibitory phosphorylation, namely by AKT, which results in nuclear exclusion of SRPK1 and SRSF1 hypophosphorylation.

Case presentation: A 37-year-old man with COVID-19 was referred to our department for bilateral visual blurring. He had been treated with ibuprofen for fever and indapamide to treat the uncontrolled blood pressure. After indapamide intake for four days, he started complaining of bilateral visual blurring. On ocular examination, the uncorrected visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/400 OS. Slit-lamp examination revealed shallow anterior chamber. In the patient’s subsequent visit on the next day, he complained of pain and redness in both eyes from the previous night. On ocular examination, the IOP decreased significantly compared to the previous day, 11 mmHg and 12 mmHg in OD and OS respectively. Slit-lamp examination revealed conjunctival injection and inflammatory cells (2+) in the shallow anterior chamber of both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed ciliary body detachment, and B-scan ultrasound showed peripheral shallow choroidal detachment in both eyes. Stopping the indapamide and treatment with oral prednisolone, topical tobramycin dexamethasone and tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops resulted in rapid recovery of the signs and symptoms after 3 days. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: Indapamide intake can induce bilateral shallow anterior chamber, ciliochoroidal detachment in both eyes, and the preexisting hyperinflammation induced by COVID-19 might increase the susceptibility; drug usage and SARS-CoV-2 infection might commonly contribute to the uveitis.

Many non-antibiotics demonstrate direct anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive cocci. The activity observed against Gram-negative rods is much lower and non-antibiotics primarily from the following groups: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cardiovascular and antidepressant medicinal products demonstrate this activity. It has been shown that the low activity of some non-antibiotics or the absence of activity against Gram-negative rods is related, among other things, to the extrusion of these compounds from bacterial cells by multi-drug resistance efflux pumps. Substrates for the resistance-nodulation-division efflux systems include the following non-antibiotics: salicylate, diclofenac, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen, amitriptyline, alendronate sodium, nicergoline, and ticlopidine. In addition, interactions between non-antibiotics and multi-drug resistance efflux pumps have been observed. It has also been revealed that depending on the concentration, salicylate induces expression of multi-drug resistance efflux pumps in Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium, and Burkholderia cenocepacia.

We evaluated upper GI effects of over-the-counter doses of 2 FD ibuprofen products and 1 FD-APAP product.<h4>Methods</h4>In a randomized, placebo-controlled, endoscopist-blinded, 4-way crossover study, 28 healthy subjects received FD ibuprofen 2×200 mg liquid capsules 3 times daily (TID), ibuprofen 2×200 mg tablets TID, FD-APAP 2×500 mg tablets 4 times daily (QID), and placebo 2×500 mg tablets QID for 7 days. The primary end point was gastric mucosal damage assessed by endoscopy using the Lanza scale: 0=normal stomach or proximal duodenum, 1=mucosal hemorrhages only, 2=1 or 2 erosions, 3=numerous (3-10) erosions, and 4=large number of erosions (>10) or ulcer. Secondary end points included duodenal mucosal damage (Lanza scale); gastroduodenal mucosal injury, classified as present (gastric and/or duodenal endoscopy score ≥2) or absent (gastric and/or duodenal endoscopy score <2); and number of hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcers counted separately in the stomach and duodenum.<h4>Results</h4>Significantly greater gastric mucosal injury was observed after treatment with both ibuprofen products vs FD-APAP (<i>p</i><0.0001 and <i>p</i>=0.0095, respectively). FD-APAP showed no difference from placebo (<i>p</i>=0.4794).

New antiplatelet drugs and many other drugs have been developed, but some drugs may have adverse effects on platelet functions.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to establish an evaluation method for evaluating the effect and adverse effect of various drugs on platelet functions.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Human erythroid leukemia (HEL) cells were used after megakaryocytic differentiation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as an alternative to platelets. Drugs were evaluated by changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) mobilization in Fura2-loaded phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced HEL cells. Aspirin and cilostazol were selected as antiplatelet drugs and ibuprofen and sodium valproate as other drugs.<h4>Results</h4>There was a positive correlation between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. Aspirin (5.6-560 µM) and cilostazol (5-10 µM) significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, ibuprofen (8-200 µM) and sodium valproate (50-1,000 µg/mL) also significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the interaction effects of the simultaneous combined use of aspirin and ibuprofen or sodium valproate were evaluated. When the inhibitory effect of aspirin was higher than that of ibuprofen, the effect of aspirin was reduced, whereas when the inhibitory effect of aspirin was lower than that of ibuprofen, the effect of ibuprofen was reduced. The combination of aspirin and sodium valproate synergistically inhibited thrombin-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is possible to induce HEL cells to differentiate into megakaryocytes, which are a useful model for the study of platelet functions, and the quantification of the inhibition of thrombin-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is applicable to the evaluation of the effects of various drugs on platelets.",2016,,"Tada T, Aki K, Oboshi W, Kawazoe K, Yasui T, Hosoi E.",https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S115910,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Fever is known to affect the host-gut microbiota crosstalk. However, the pharmacological mechanism of XQJRG in this regard remains unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>This study utilized a young febrile rat model previously reported by our team and extended the rat body temperature monitoring period following drug administration to explore the differences in efficacy between XQJRG and the commonly used pediatric antipyretic ibuprofen. Subsequently, the colonic contents of rats were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. The short-chain fatty acid content was quantified using high-throughput targeted metabolomics. The expression of short-chain fatty acid receptors and pro-inflammatory genes in the colonic tissue was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.<h4>Results</h4>XQJRG showed a longer antipyretic duration than ibuprofen. XQJRG improved dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in young febrile rats, bringing its flora composition closer to that of normal rats. It significantly increased the relative abundance of <i>s_Phascolarctobacterium_faecium</i> and <i>s_Roseburia_sp</i>. related to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the contents of butyric acid and nonanoic acid and protein levels of SCFAs receptor GPR41. Moreover, XQJRG significantly increased the levels of metabolites with anti-inflammatory effects, reduced the contents of metabolites directly associated with fever, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the colon of young febrile rats to normal levels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>XQJRG exhibited a more stable and persistent antipyretic effect in young febrile rats compared to ibuprofen.

The results demonstrated that 5-HT had no or negligible effect on aggregation but it did potentiate the aggregation response of AA. Similarly, the combination of subeffective concentrations of ADP and AA exhibited noticeable rise in platelet aggregation. Moreover, the observed synergistic effect of AA with 5-HT on platelets was inhibited by different cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, namely ibuprofen and celecoxib, with half maximal inhibitory effect (IC50) values of 18.0 ± 1.8 and 15.6 ± 3.4 μmol/L, respectively. Interestingly, the synergistic effect observed for AA with 5-HT was, also, blocked by the 5-HT receptor blockers cyproheptadine (IC50=22.0 ± 7 μmol/L), ketanserin (IC50=152 ± 23 μmol/L), phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor (U73122; IC50=6.1 ± 0.8 μmol/L), and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor (PD98059; IC50=3.8 ± 0.5 μmol/L). Likewise, the synergism of AA and ADP was, also, attenuated by COX inhibitors (ibuprofen; IC50=20 ± 4 μmol/L and celecoxib; IC50=24 ± 7 μmol/L), PLC inhibitor (U73122; IC50=3.7 ± 0.3 μmol/L), and MAPK inhibitor (PD98059; IC50=2.8 ± 1.1 μmol/L). Our observed data demonstrate that the combination of subthreshold concentrations of agonists amplifies platelet aggregation and that these synergistic effects largely depend on activation of COX/thromboxane A2, receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels, Gq/PLC, and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, our data revealed that inhibition of COX pathways by using both selective and/or non-selective COX inhibitors blocks not only AA metabolism and thromboxane A2 formation, but also its binding to Gq receptors and activation of receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels in platelets. Overall, our results show that PLC and MAPK inhibitors proved to inhibit the synergistic activation of platelets by several/multiple agonists.",2015,,"Khan N, Farooq AD, Sadek B.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=25811,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This was followed by in vivo evaluation of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the promising formulae and comparison of the effects with that of the commercially available gel.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Among all other formulae, formula G40 (Carbopol® 940-free formula) had a superior ability in transferring ibuprofen topically compared with the reference. Carbopol® 940 significantly decreased the amount of drug transferred from formula G41 through the skin as a result of swelling, gel formation, and reduction in drug thermodynamic activity. Nonetheless, the addition of 10% w/w of menthol and limonene successfully overcame this drawback since, relative to the reference, higher amount of ibuprofen was transferred through the skin. By contrast, these results were relatively comparable to that of formula G40. Pharmacodynamically, the G40, G45, and G47 formulae exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects compared with other formulae.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ingredients and the physical properties of the nanoscaled emulsions produced by using the newly synthesized POEs succeeded to deliver ibuprofen competently.",2011,,"Abdullah GZ, Abdulkarim MF, Salman IM, Ameer OZ, Yam MF, Mutee AF, Chitneni M, Mahdi ES, Basri M, Sattar MA, Noor AM.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S14667,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Then, IBU was incorporated into B-BMSF@PEI at the drug:carrier weight ratio of 1:1. The structural features of IBU before and after drug loading were systemically characterized. IBU and B-BMSF@PEI were then subject to in vitro drug release study and wettability analysis. Finally, in vivo pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory pharmacodynamics studies were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of B-BMSF@PEI on improving the oral adsorption of IBU.<h4>Results</h4>The results demonstrated that B-BMSF@PEI was a meso-meso porous silica material with foam appearance. It consisted of uniform spherical cells (40 nm) with interconnected pore networks. IBU can be successfully loaded into B-BMSF@PEI with high efficiency (as high as 39.53%), and crystal IBU was effectively converted to an amorphous state during this process. Benefiting from the great architectures of B-BMSF@PEI, IBU/B-BMSF@PEI performed good wetting property and significantly improved the dissolution rate in both simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). Notably, IBU exhibited very satisfactory relative bioavailability (681.4%) and anti-inflammatory effects (the inhibition rates were between the ranges of 113.5% to 1504.3%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>B-BMSF@PEI with bimodal mesoporous system and interconnected nanopores was obtained owing to the dynamic self-assembly functions of PEIs.

However, its clinical toxicity, side effects, and its limited bioavailability, resulted in inadequate clinical therapeutic efficacy. Building neoteric, simple, and safe drug delivery systems with existing drugs offers new options. Therefore, we aimed to construct a micelle to improve the clinical efficacy of sunitinib by reusing ibuprofen.<h4>Methods</h4>We synthesized the sialic acid-poly (ethylene glycol)-ibuprofen (SA-PEG-IBU) amphipathic conjugate in two-step reaction. The SA-PEG-IBU amphiphilic conjugates can form into stable SPI nanomicelles in aqueous solution, which can be further loaded sunitinib (SU) to obtain the SPI/SU system. Following nanomicelle creation, sialic acid exposed to the nanomicelle surface can recognize the overexpressed E-selectin receptor on the membrane of cancer cells to enhance cellular uptake. The properties of morphology, stability, and drug release about the SPI/SU nanomicelles were investigated. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used to assess the cellular uptake efficiency of nanomicelles in vitro. Finally, a xenograft tumor model in nude mice was constructed to investigate the body distribution and tumor suppression of SPI/SU in vivo.<h4>Results</h4>The result showed that SPI nanomicelles exhibited excellent tumor targeting performance and inhibited the migration and invasion of tumor cell in vitro. The SPI nanomicelles can improve the accumulation of drugs in the tumor site that showed effective tumor inhibition in vivo. In addition, H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the SPI/SU nanomicelles had a superior therapeutic effect and lower biotoxicity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SPI/SU nanomicelles displayed excellent anti-tumor ability, and can suppress the metastasis of tumor cell by decreasing the expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 due to the ibuprofen, providing an optimistic clinical application potential by developing a simple but safe drug delivery system.",2022,,"Zeng X, Teng Y, Zhu C, Li Z, Liu T, Sun Y, Han S.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S388234,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The different chemical structures, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and/or COX-2 inhibitors, are taken at all ages and some can be easily obtained over the counter. Vasoactive inflammatory mediators like histamine and leukotriene metabolites can produce local/systemic effects. Responders can be selective (SR), IgE or T-cell mediated, or cross-intolerant (CI). Inhibition of the COX pathway is the common mechanism in CI, with the skin being the most frequent organ involved, followed by the lung and/or the nose. An important number of cases have skin and respiratory involvement, with systemic manifestations ranging from mild to severe anaphylaxis. Among SR, this is the most frequent entity, often being severe. Recent years have seen an increase in reactions involving the skin, with many cases having urticaria and/or angioedema in the absence of chronic urticaria. Aspirin, the classical drug involved, has now been replaced by other NSAIDs, with ibuprofen being the universal culprit. For CI, no in vivo/in vitro diagnostic methods exist and controlled administration is the only option unless the cases evaluated report repetitive and consistent episodes with different NSAIDs. In SR, skin testing (patch and intradermal) with 24-48 reading can be useful, mainly for delayed T-cell responses.

The phytochemical contents of the <i>n</i>-hexane fraction of <i>Alstonia boonei</i> and their anti-inflammatory potentials in lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation were investigated in rat liver.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A quantity of 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation in twenty-five male Wistar rats, grouped (n = 5) and treated as follows: negative control (10 mL/kg saline), positive control (1 mg/kg ibuprofen); 50, 100 and 20 mg/kg of the <i>n</i>-hexane fraction of <i>Alstonia boonei</i> were administered to test groups. In another experiment, twenty rats (n = 5, without LPS) were administered the same doses of the <i>n</i>-hexane fraction of <i>A. boonei and</i> ibuprofen for seven days. At the end of the experiment, animals were sacrificed, serum was obtained from blood and liver mitochondria isolated in a refrigerated centrifuge. Mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) pore opening and mitochondrial F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATPase (mATPase) were determined spectrophotometrically. Serum interleukins 1β, 6 (IL-1β, IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine kinase (CK), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT,) of the animals in which inflammation was induced using LPS but treated with graded doses of <i>n</i>-hexane fraction of <i>A. boonei</i> were determined using the ELISA technique. The phytochemical contents of the <i>n</i>-hexane fraction of <i>A. boonei</i> were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS).<h4>Results</h4>Calcium induced mPT in 8 fold and LPS induced mPT 14 fold in the negative control while the <i>n</i>-hexane fraction reversed mPT in the treated groups (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) to 2, 4, 4 folds, respectively.

Neutrophils, except unactivated control cells, were activated with 10 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cells were cultured with a range of different concentrations of the A. annua extracts (400-1 μg/mL) and artemisinin (200 and 100 μg/mL) and the supernatants were then tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the concentrations of TNF-α and PGE2. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Positive controls with an inhibitor were assayed in triplicate: chloroquine 2.58 and 5.16 μg/mL for TNF-α, and ibuprofen 400 μg/mL for PGE2. An unsupplemented group was also assessed in triplicate as a baseline control.<h4>Results</h4>Neutrophils were stimulated to an inflammatory state by the addition of LPS. A. annua extract significantly inhibited TNF-α production by activated neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner. There was complete inhibition by the A. annua extract at 200, 100, and 50 μg/mL (all P≤0.0003).

Transdermal (TD) administration of NSAIDs circumvents these adverse events by avoiding the GI tract and, presumably, achieves regional drug levels of therapeutic effect and thereby, fewer off-target complications.<h4>Methods</h4>A drug quantification method was developed for ibuprofen and celecoxib in canine plasma and synovial fluid using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method was employed to evaluate the penetrance of ibuprofen and celecoxib topical formulations in dogs. Effectiveness of these topical NSAID formulations was compared to the equivalent oral drug concentration in a canine sodium-urate model of acute joint inflammation. In this model, pain was quantified using a modified Canine Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire and regional inflammation using joint caliper measurements; the significance of intervention was evaluated using linear mixed models for repeated measures along with Bonferroni corrections.<h4>Results</h4>After seven days of chronic topical administration, Delivra™ (DEL) formulations of ibuprofen and celecoxib generated serum levels of 2.9µg/mL and 220ng/mL and synovial fluid levels of 1.8 µg/mL and 203 ng/mL (respectively). In the canine model of acute inflammation, the overall treatment effects as well as the treatment by time interactions were strongly significant (<i>P</i><0.001) for both drugs. Oral ibuprofen proved uniquely effective at the earliest time point, while all ibuprofen formulations were effective at treating pain at 8.5 and 24.5 hours post-induction. Similarly, all celecoxib formulations (oral and topical) were equally effective at 8.5 and 24.5 hours post-induction.<h4>Conclusion</h4>DEL formulations of ibuprofen and celecoxib successfully introduced these NSAIDs into synovial fluid at concentrations similar to those observed in circulation. Furthermore, these formulations reduced symptoms of pain associated with acute inflammation. Oral and transdermally delivered NSAIDs have similar pain relief effects; therefore, a replacement or combinatorial treatment may provide a more stable pain relief profile.

Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products (NSAIDs) are often the first-choice immediate treatment. This study examined the effect of commercially available and newly developed transdermal NSAID products on the solubility of MSU in a physiologically relevant system, alongside the efficacy of transdermal NSAID delivery.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Drug permeability of 7 commercially available topical NSAID products, alongside 3 newly developed ""Gout Buster"" products, was evaluated in vitro using pig's ear skin in Franz diffusion cells. The standard Franz cell experimental protocol was adapted to include assessment of MSU solubility in phosphate buffered saline for each product. Some materials were also tested via direct solubility studies.<h4>Results</h4>The amount of drug delivered transdermally varied significantly between different formulations, with the best ibuprofen delivery being ~5 times higher than the lowest, and best diclofenac delivery being ~3.5 times higher than the lowest. Changes in formulations and the drug concentration in the product both affected the amount of drug delivered. Overall ibuprofen permeation was higher than diclofenac. The commercially available products showed little or no effect on the MSU solubility (99-103% vs control). The Gout Buster products showed significant improvement in the MSU solubility after permeation through skin (120-126%). Increased sodium levels reduced the solubility of MSU in direct solubility studies.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In these trials, the Gout Buster products showed significantly improved permeation of both ibuprofen and diclofenac over the commercial products at similar drug concentrations, and showed significant improvement for MSU solubility. Increased sodium levels reduced the solubility of MSU and could cause more crystallisation in vivo. Therefore, topical NSAID products with the Gout Buster formulation may have the best likelihood of both reducing inflammation and helping re-dissolve the MSU crystals that cause gout.",2022,,"Hooper MW, He L.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=81789,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective alternative strategy for treating PDM as it regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the exact anti-inflammatory mechanism of EA remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the therapeutic effect of EA on PDM and determined the potential involvement of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/NLRP3 signaling pathway.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>The following pain management interventions were administered to a PDM rat model: saline (control), EA, parecoxib, EA + parecoxib, or ibuprofen. After treatment, the following parameters were examined: torsion behavior; endometrial histopathological morphology and ultrastructure; serum and uterine prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> (PGF<sub>2α</sub>) levels; nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65; and the expression of COX-2, phospho-NF-κBp65.

The management of acute and post-operative pain and fever with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) is well documented. A search in Medline and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts of articles until the end of November 2009 and references of all citations were conducted. Available manufacturer data on file were also analyzed for this report. Several randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the opioid-sparing and analgesic effects of 400 and 800 mg doses of intravenous ibuprofen in a series of post-operative patient populations. Two recent studies have also noted the improvement in fever curves in critically ill and burn patients. These data, along with pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic properties, are explored in this review, which addresses the clinical utility of a parenteral NSAID in a hospitalized patient for post-operative pain management and fever reduction.

Treatment guidelines for chronic NSAID therapy include the consideration for gastroprotection for those at risk of gastric ulcers (GUs) associated with the chronic NSAID therapy. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets for the relief of signs and symptoms of OA, RA, and AS, and to decrease the risk of developing GUs in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated GUs. The European Medical Association has approved this therapy for the symptomatic treatment of OA, RA, and AS in patients who are at risk of developing NSAID-associated GUs and/or duodenal ulcers, for whom treatment with lower doses of naproxen or other NSAIDs is not considered sufficient. Naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets have been compared with naproxen and celecoxib for these indications in head-to-head trials. This systematic literature review and network meta-analyses of data from randomized controlled trials was performed to compare naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets with a number of additional relevant comparators. For this study, an original review examined MEDLINE<sup>®</sup>, Embase<sup>®</sup>, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from database start to April 14, 2009. Using the same methodology, a review update was conducted to December 21, 2009. The systematic review and network analyses showed naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets have an improved upper gastrointestinal tolerability profile (dyspepsia and gastric or gastroduodenal ulcers) over several active comparators (naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, etoricoxib, and fixed-dose diclofenac sodium plus misoprostol), and are equally effective as all active comparators in treating arthritic symptoms in patients with OA, RA, and AS. Naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets are therefore a valuable option for treating arthritic symptoms in eligible patients with OA, RA, and AS.",2013,,"Datto C, Hellmund R, Siddiqui MK.",https://doi.org/10.2147/OARRR.S41420,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The mechanism of action of all NSAIDs is through reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) including gastrointestinal bleeding as well as cardiovascular and renal effects have been reported with NSAID use. In many cases, ADRs may occur because of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between the NSAID and a concomitant medication. For example, DDIs have been reported when NSAIDs are coadministered with aspirin, alcohol, some antihypertensives, antidepressants, and other commonly used medications. Because of the pharmacologic nature of these interactions, there is a continuum of risk in that the potential for an ADR is dependent on total drug exposure. Therefore, consideration of dose and duration of NSAID use, as well as the type or class of comedication administered, is important when assessing potential risk for ADRs. Safety findings from clinical studies evaluating prescription-strength NSAIDs may not be directly applicable to OTC dosing. Health care providers can be instrumental in educating patients that using OTC NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest required duration is vital to balancing efficacy and safety. This review discusses some of the most clinically relevant DDIs reported with NSAIDs based on major sites of ADRs and classes of medication, with a focus on OTC ibuprofen, for which the most data are available.",2015,,"Moore N, Pollack C, Butkerait P.",https://doi.org/10.2147/TCRM.S79135,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite the known association between NSAID use and gastropathy, however, only around one-third of patients at risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity receive adequate gastroprotection, and as many as 44% of these patients are non-adherent. We review the co-prescription of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastropathy, with a particular focus on the first fixed-dose NSAID/PPI formulation: ketoprofen/omeprazole modified-release capsules. The ketoprofen/omeprazole fixed-dose combination is available in doses of 100 mg/20 mg, 150 mg/20 mg or 200 mg/20 mg as a single capsule for once-daily administration. Ketoprofen monotherapy has been shown to be generally equivalent to other NSAIDs when used in the treatment of OA. In RA, ketoprofen has demonstrated equivalent efficacy to diclofenac, indometacin, piroxicam, aceclofenac, phenylbutazone, naproxen and flurbiprofen. Studies comparing ketoprofen with ibuprofen and sulindac in patients with RA have, in general, favoured ketoprofen. Studies in AS have generally reported similar efficacy between ketoprofen and phenylbutazone and pirprofen. Prophylaxis with omeprazole is effective for the prevention of gastroduodenal ulcers, maintenance of remission and alleviation of dyspeptic symptoms in NSAID recipients. Omeprazole is well tolerated, and adverse events are generally gastrointestinal in nature. The fixed-dose combination of ketoprofen and omeprazole has demonstrated bioequivalence to the respective monotherapies. The incidence of digestive symptoms and the need for dose reduction was reported to be lower with the combination than with its components. Ketoprofen/omeprazole modified-release capsules are the first fixed-dose NSAID/PPI formulation to be approved. This formulation ensures compliance with the gastroprotective prophylaxis, as whenever the NSAID is taken, the PPI is co-administered. Additionally, the once-daily formulation has the potential to improve adherence to anti-inflammatory therapy.",2012,,"Gigante A, Tagarro I.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11596670-000000000-00000,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Common treatment modalities are usually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, paracetamol, indomethacin and ibuprofen as well as corticosteroids such as prednisone. These however, may be associated with a host of side effects due to non-selectivity for cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes involved in inflammation and those with selectivity may be highly priced. Thus, there is a continuing search for safe and effective antiinflammatory molecules from natural sources. Research has confirmed that iridoids exhibit promising anti-inflammatory activity which may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammation. Iridoids are secondary metabolites present in various plants, especially in species belonging to the Apocynaceae, Lamiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Verbenaceae families. Many of these ethnobotanicals have an illustrious history of traditional use alluding to their use to treat inflammation.

These reactions can be IgE dependent (immediate reactions), T cell-mediated (non-immediate), or induced by a non-specific immunological mechanism related with the blocking of the COX-1 enzyme and the shunting to the lipooxygenase pathway (cross-intolerant reactions). Cutaneous symptoms are the most frequent, with ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac being common culprit drugs worldwide, although others can be involved because patterns of consumption and exposure rates vary between countries. A very important proportion of immunological reactions are immediate, with urticaria and anaphylaxis being the typical clinical manifestations. Non-immediate reactions comprise a number of heterogeneous entities ranging from mild exanthema to severe TEN or DRESS syndrome, as well as organ-specific reactions such as hepatitis or pneumonitis. Cross-intolerant reactions appear to non-chemically related drugs, and involve respiratory airways, skin or both. In vivo diagnostic tests are based on the capacity of the skin to respond to the culprit drug, but their sensitivity is in many instances rather low. The approach for in vitro testing consists of either detecting specific IgE antibodies or studying the proliferation of T lymphocytes toward the eliciting drug. No appropriate tests are yet available for the in vitro validation of cross-intolerance reactions, although techniques based on the stimulation of basophils have been proposed. Based on these findings, the diagnostic approach is often based on the controlled administration of the drug to assess tolerance.

Ibuprofen, which shares the same primary albumin binding site with p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, can be infused during hemodialysis to displace these toxins, thereby augmenting their removal.<h4>Design, setting, participants, & measurements</h4>We infused 800 mg ibuprofen into the arterial bloodline between minutes 21 and 40 of a conventional 4-hour high-flux hemodialysis treatment. We measured arterial, venous, and dialysate outlet concentrations of indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, tryptophan, ibuprofen, urea, and creatinine before, during, and after the ibuprofen infusion. We report clearances of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate before and during ibuprofen infusion and dialysate concentrations of protein-bound uremic toxins normalized to each patient's average preinfusion concentrations.<h4>Results</h4>We studied 18 patients on maintenance hemodialysis: age 36±11 years old, ten women, and mean vintage of 37±37 months. Compared with during the preinfusion period, the median (interquartile range) clearances of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate increased during ibuprofen infusion from 6.0 (6.5) to 20.2 (27.1) ml/min and from 4.4 (6.7) to 14.9 (27.1) ml/min (each <i>P</i><0.001), respectively. Relative median (interquartile range) protein-bound uremic toxin dialysate outlet levels increased from preinfusion 1.0 (reference) to 2.4 (1.2) for indoxyl sulfate and to 2.4 (1.0) for p-cresyl sulfate (each <i>P</i><0.001). Although median serum post- and predialyzer levels in the preinfusion period were similar, infusion led to a marked drop in serum postdialyzer levels for both indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate (-1.0 and -0.3 mg/dl, respectively; each <i>P</i><0.001). The removal of the nonprotein-bound solutes creatinine and urea was not increased by the ibuprofen infusion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Infusion of ibuprofen into the arterial bloodline during hemodialysis significantly increases the dialytic removal of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate and thereby, leads to greater reduction in their serum levels.",2019,,"Madero M, Cano KB, Campos I, Tao X, Maheshwari V, Brown J, Cornejo B, Handelman G, Thijssen S, Kotanko P.",https://doi.org/10.2215/CJN.05240418,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Oleocanthal (OO), one of the most potent bioactive phenols of extra virgin olive oil, has shown redox modulating properties in vitro. However, its acute, in vivo antioxidant properties have never been studied before.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of five redox markers (Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS] and glutathione peroxidase activity in serum-GPx3 and erythrocytes (GPx1), protein carbonyls in serum) after the consumption different meals.<h4>Design</h4>Five different isocaloric meals comprised of white bread and butter (BU) or butter plus ibuprofen (BU-IBU) or olive oil poor in OO or olive oils containing 250 and 500 mg/Kg of oleocanthal (OO250 and OO500, respectively). We hypothesized that OO-rich olive oil will reduce postprandial oxidative stress in T2DM patients compared to other lipid sources. This study involved 10 patients with T2DM and had a cross-over design.<h4>Results</h4>The comparison of incremental Area Under Curves (iAUCs) has shown that OO-rich olive oils were able to alleviate the increments of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and GPx3 and induce a higher red blood cells (RBCs) GPx1 activity compared to OO (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The effect was dose and redox marker depended. Correlation analysis in the pooled sample demonstrated a positive association between postprandial ex vivo platelet sensitivity to ADP and iAUC TBARS. In conclusion, our study has shown that OO-rich olive oils can favorably modulate lipid peroxidation and RBC GPx activity in T2DM patients when consumed as part of a carbohydrate meal.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study demonstrates for the first time that, apart from its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties, OO can also exert acute antioxidant effects.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This finding emphasizes the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil, particularly those with a high OO content, for T2DM patients.",2024,,"Katsa ME, Gil APR, Makri EM, Papadogiannis S, Ioannidis A, Kalliostra M, Ketselidi K, Diamantakos P, Melliou E, Magiatis P, Nomikos T.",https://doi.org/10.29219/fnr.v68.10882,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The present study examines the efficacy of S-(+)-ibuprofen on cartilage degradation as drug candidate for DDS loading. Humeral cartilage and joint capsule explants were collected from healthy sheep shoulder joints and they were cultured in mono- or in co-culture for 13 days with LPS in combination with S-(+)-ibuprofen at 50 µM and 1 mM. S-(+)-ibuprofen (50 µM) blocked prostaglandins production in LPS-activated explants but did not reduce cartilage degradation. By contrast, 1 mM S-(+)-ibuprofen treatment of cartilage explants reduced nitric oxide synthesis by 51% (p = 0.0072), proteoglycans degradation by 35% (p = 0.0114) and expression of serum amyloid protein - the main protein induced upon LPS challenge - by 44% (p < 0.0001). On contrary, in presence of synovial membrane, the protective effects of S-(+)-ibuprofen on cartilage damages were significantly diminished. At 1mM, S-(+)-ibuprofen reduced the cell lysis during culture of cartilage and joint capsule either in mono- or in co-culture. This study performed on sheep explants shows that 1 mM S-(+)-ibuprofen inhibited cartilage degradation via a mechanism independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition.

In vitro studies were performed using cellulose membrane and rabbit skin, whereas in vivo studies were performed on rabbits. Overall, higher transport data were obtained with the cellulose membrane. Nonetheless, with both barriers, transport was higher with the gel formulation than oleaginous or emulsion based preparations, which was also dependent on the viscosity of the gel and the concentration of the formulation additives. Transport increased with the increase in alcohol concentration and decreased with the addition of propylene glycol. Ultrasound had a significant effect on ibuprofen transport.

However, it causes gastrointestinal troubles when administered orally, thereby decreasing patient compliance. Transdermal application of vesicular formulation of Ibuprofen will provide better patient compliance and efficacy.<h4>Methods</h4>Six different compositions of lipid constituents have been formulated into nanovesicles using thin-film hydration method and dispersed into gel using Carbopol 934. The formulations were characterized based on physicochemical parameters using photon correlation spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, in vitro drug release, ex vivo skin permeation using human skin, and in vivo studies.<h4>Results</h4>The formulation, ibuprofen liposomal gel-5 (ILG-5), had nanoliposome of smallest size (159 nm) and polydispersity index (0.331). This formulation showed moderate zeta potential and the highest encapsulation. All the formulations including IG showed a considerable amount of drug release through in vitro synthetic membrane. ILG-5 showed maximum permeation during skin permeation studies. IG showed no permeation in ex vivo settings.

Clinical trials, on the other hand, have been less positive. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that NSAIDs exert part of their effects by reducing long-term cerebral neuroinflammation, although this mechanism has not been proven. In this study, we report that ibuprofen, one of the more widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, was able to alter the ultrastructure of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and significantly decrease its association to neuronal membranes, and consequently, its synaptotoxic effect in rat primary hippocampal and cortical cultures at 24 h incubation. In agreement with these results, we found that the decrease in the frequency of calcium transients with Aβ was partly recovered by addition of ibuprofen (8.0 × 10-2 Hz in control; 3.4 × 10-2 Hz in 5 μM Aβ, and 5.9 × 10-2 Hz in the presence of Aβ and 200 μM ibuprofen). Additionally, this effect correlated well with the increment and recovery of miniature spontaneous currents (47 ± 5% of control in 1 μM Aβ alone and 104 ± 14% in the presence of Aβ and ibuprofen). Our results suggest that ibuprofen could be exerting its neuroprotective effect by directly interacting with Aβ and altering its toxic aggregated forms.

High density lipoprotein (HDL), a normal plasma carrier of Abeta, is used to attenuate Abeta aggregation within the pump, causing Abeta-dependent toxicity and cognitive deficits within 3 months. Our goal was to identify factors that might accelerate onset of Abeta-dependent deficits to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of model. We focused on: 1) optimizing HDL-Abeta preparation for maximal toxicity; 2) evaluating the role of copper, a factor typically in water that can impact oligomer stability; and 3) determining impact of insulin resistance (type II diabetes), a risk factor for AD. In vitro studies were performed to determine doses of copper and methods of Abeta-HDL preparation that maximized toxicity. These preparations when infused resulted in earlier onset of cognitive deficits within 6 weeks post-infusion. Induction of insulin resistance did not exacerbate Abeta-dependent cognitive deficits, but did exacerbate synaptic protein loss.

Initially, we developed an initial and advanced stage of the Parkinson disease mouse model by intraperitoneal injection of MPTP (20 mg/kg; 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine) for 10 and 20 days, respectively. Subsequently, ibuprofen treatment was administered for 2 months, and a pole test, rotarod test, histology, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting were performed to determine neuronal motor function. Histological analysis for 10 days after mice were injected with MPTP showed the onset of neurodegeneration and cell aggregation, indicating the initial stages of Parkinson's disease. Advanced Parkinson's disease was marked by Lewy body formation after another 10 days of MPTP injection. Neurodegeneration reverted after ibuprofen therapy in initial Parkinson's disease but not in advanced Parkinson's disease. The pole and rotarod tests confirmed that motor activity in the initial Parkinson disease with ibuprofen treatment recovered (p<0.01). However, no improvement was observed in the ibuprofen-treated mice with advanced disease mice. Interestingly, ibuprofen treatment resulted in a significant improvement (p<0.01) in NURR1 (Nuclear receptor-related 1) expression in mice with early PD, but no substantial improvement was observed in its expression in mice with advanced PD.

In this study, we evaluated the <i>in vivo</i> biocompatibility and regenerative potential of a nanoenabled collagen-polylactide (Col-PLA) scaffold functionalized with tri-combinatorial nanoemulsions delivering ibuprofen (anti-inflammatory), batimastat (BB-94, anti-proteolytic), and mupirocin (anti-bacterial). Using a femoral osteochondral defect model in New Zealand White rabbits, regeneration was assessed at 4- and 12-week post-implantation by macroscopic scoring, biomechanical indentation mapping, and histological analysis. Synovial inflammation was further evaluated via histology, CD8 immunostaining, and quantification of key pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Both functionalized and non-functionalized Col-PLA scaffolds supported significant host cell infiltration and tissue regeneration, outperforming untreated controls and demonstrating effective subchondral bone repair.

Although cartilage repair was comparable between scaffold groups, the nanoenabled Col-PLA scaffold might have a potential benefit in more complex or comorbid clinical scenarios due to its immunomodulatory, anti-proteolytic, and anti-microbial functionalization.

Our aim is to discover new anti-virulence therapies targeting MRSA and VRSA virulence arrays.<h4>Methodology</h4>We employed phenotypic, molecular docking, and genetic studies to screen for anti-virulence activities among selected promising compounds: Coumarin, Simvastatin, and Ibuprofen.<h4>Results</h4>We found that nearly all detected MRSA and VRSA strains exhibited MDR and multi-virulent profiles. The molecular docking results aligned with the phenotypic and genetic assessments of virulence production. Biofilm and hemolysin productions were inhibited, and all virulence genes were downregulated upon treatment with sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of these promising compounds. Ibuprofen was the most active compound, exhibiting the highest inhibition and downregulation of virulence gene products. Moreover, <i>in vivo</i> and histopathological studies confirmed these results. Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in wound area and improvements in re-epithelialization and tissue organization in the Ibuprofen and antimicrobial treated group compared with the group treated with antimicrobial alone.

This case prompted a thorough review of the existing literature to elucidate possible mechanisms by which immune responses to the COVID-19 vaccine might precipitate thyroid damage. The primary objective is to enhance the clinical understanding and awareness of SAT among healthcare professionals. Subacute thyroiditis is a prevalent form of self-limiting thyroid disorder characterized by fever, neck pain or tenderness, and palpitations subsequent to viral infection. The development of numerous SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic was intended to mitigate the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, there have been documented instances of adverse reactions arising from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such as the infrequent occurrence of subacute thyroiditis. While the majority of medical practitioners can discern classic subacute thyroiditis, not all cases exhibit typical characteristics, and not all systematic treatments yield positive responses. In this study, we present a rare case of subacute thyroiditis linked to the administration of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A previously healthy middle-aged female developed fever and sore throat 72 h post-inoculation with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Initially attributing these symptoms to a common cold, she self-administered ibuprofen, which normalized her body temperature but failed to alleviate persistent sore throat. Suspecting a laryngopharyngeal disorder, she sought treatment from an otolaryngologist. However, the pain persisted, accompanied by intermittent fever over several days. After an endocrinology consultation, despite the absence of typical neck pain, her examination revealed abnormal thyroid function, normal thyroid antibodies, heterogeneous echogenicity on thyroid ultrasonography, and elevated levels of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). These findings led to a consideration of the diagnosis of SAT. Initially, she was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for her fever, which proved effective, but her neck pain remained uncontrolled. This suggested a poor response to NSAIDs. Consequently, steroid therapy was initiated, after which her symptoms of fever and neck pain rapidly resolved.",2024,,"Yang S, Guan T, Yang H, Hu Y, Zhao Y.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2024.1349615,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, there are numerous factors that lead to OS, therefore, identifying the key genes associated with PCOS that contribute to OS is crucial for elucidating the pathogenesis of PCOS and selecting appropriate treatment strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>Four datasets (GSE95728, GSE106724, GSE138572, and GSE145296) were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. GSE95728 and GSE106724 were combined to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PCOS. weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key module genes associated with PCOS. Differentially expressed OS related genes (DE-OSRGs) associated with PCOS were obtained by overlapping DEGs, key module genes, and OSRGs. Subsequently, the optimal machine model was obtained to identify key genes by comparing the performance of the random forest model (RF), support vector machine model (SVM), and generalized linear model (GLM). The molecular networks were constructed to reveal the non-coding regulatory mechanisms of key genes based on GSE138572 and GSE145296. The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) was used to predict the potential therapeutic agents of key genes for PCOS. Finally, the expression of key OSRGs was validated by RT-PCR.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, 8 DE-OSRGs were identified. Based on the residuals and root mean square error of the three models, the best performance of RF was derived and 7 key genes (<i>TNFSF10, CBL, IFNG, CP, CASP8, APOA1</i>, and <i>DDIT3</i>) were identified. The GSEA enrichment analysis revealed that <i>TNFSF10, CP, DDIT3</i>, and <i>INFG</i> are all enriched in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways. The molecular regulatory network uncovered that both <i>TNFSF10</i> and <i>CBL</i> are regulated by non-coding RNAs. Additionally, 70 potential therapeutic drugs for PCOS were predicted, with ibuprofen associated with <i>DDIT3</i> and <i>IFNG</i>.

However, the role of endogenous α-MMC under viral infection and the mechanism of the anti-viral activities of α-MMC in plants are still unknown. To study the effect of α-MMC on plant viral defense and how α-MMC increases plant resistance to virus, the <i>M. charantia</i>-<i>cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) interaction system was investigated. The results showed that the α-MMC level was positively correlated with the resistance of <i>M. charantia</i> to CMV. α-MMC treatment could alleviate photosystem damage and enhance the ratio of glutathione/glutathione disulfide in <i>M. charantia</i> under CMV infection. The relationship of α-MMC and defense related phytohormones, and their roles in plant defense were further investigated. α-MMC treatment led to a significant increase of jasmonic acid (JA) and vice versa, while there was no obvious relevance between salicylic acid and α-MMC. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were induced in α-MMC-pretreated plants, in a similar way to the ROS burst in JA-pretreated plants.

The formation of a Candida biofilm can decrease Candida sensitivity to antifungal drugs and cause drug resistance. Although many effective antifungal drugs are available, their applications are limited due to their high toxicity and cost. Seeking new antifungal agents that are effective against biofilm-associated infection is an urgent need. Many research efforts are underway, and some progress has been made in this field. It has been shown that the arachidonic acid cascade plays an important role in fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity. Notably, prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) can promote the formation of a Candida biofilm. Recently, the inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub> has received much attention. Studies have shown that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin, combined with fluconazole can significantly reduce Candida adhesion and biofilm development and increase fluconazole susceptibility; the MIC of fluconazole can be decrease from 64 to 2 μg/ml when used in combination with ibuprofen. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> studies have also confirmed the antifungal activities of these inhibitors. In this article, we mainly review the relationship between PGE<sub>2</sub> and Candida biofilm, summarize the antifungal activities of COX inhibitors and analyze the possible antifungal activity of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (MPGES-1) inhibitors; additionally, other factors that influence PGE<sub>2</sub> production are also discussed.

Here we sought to review the currently available data on the anti-biofilm activity of NSAIDs and its relevance in a clinical context. We performed a systematic literature review to identify the most commonly tested NSAIDs drugs in the last 5 years, the bacterial species that have demonstrated to be responsive to their actions, and the emergence of resistance to these molecules. We found that most studies investigating NSAIDs' activity against biofilms were <i>in vitro</i>, and frequently tested non-clinical bacterial isolates, which may not adequately represent the bacterial populations that cause clinically-relevant biofilm-related infections. Furthermore, studies concerning NSAIDs and antibiotic resistance are scarce, with divergent outcomes.

In rats, permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) causes a progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, learning deficits and memory loss as it occurs in AD. Kyotorphin (KTP) is an endogenous antinociceptive dipeptide whose role as neuromodulator/neuroprotector has been suggested. Recently, we designed two analgesic KTP-derivatives, KTP-amide (KTP-NH2) and KTP-NH2 linked to ibuprofen (IbKTP-NH2) to improve KTP brain targeting. This study investigated the effects of KTP-derivatives on cognitive/behavioral functions (motor/spatial memory/nociception) and hippocampal pathology of female rats in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (2VO-rat model). 2VO-animals were treated with KTP-NH2 or IbKTP-NH2 for 7 days at weeks 2 and 5 post-surgery. After behavioral testing (week 6), coronal sections of hippocampus were H&E-stained or immunolabeled for the cellular markers GFAP (astrocytes) and NFL (neurons).

Due to the lack of a screening platform, which could allow in-vitro testing of several variables simultaneously, up to now no comprehensive study has addressed and clarified how different lesion microenvironment properties affect astrogliosis. Using astrocytes cultured in alginate gels and meningeal fibroblast conditioned medium, we have built a simple and reproducible 3D culture system of astrogliosis mimicking many features of the glial scar. Cells in this 3D culture model behave similarly to scar astrocytes, showing changes in gene expression (e.g., GFAP) and increased extra-cellular matrix production (chondroitin 4 sulfate and collagen), inhibiting neuronal outgrowth. This behavior being influenced by the hydrogel network properties. Astrocytic reactivity was found to be dependent on RhoA activity, and targeting RhoA using shRNA-mediated lentivirus reduced astrocytic reactivity. Further, we have shown that chemical inhibition of RhoA with ibuprofen or indirectly targeting RhoA by the induction of extracellular matrix composition modification with chondroitinase ABC, can diminish astrogliosis. Besides presenting the extracellular matrix as a key modulator of astrogliosis, this simple, controlled and reproducible 3D culture system constitutes a good scar-like system and offers great potential in future neurodegenerative mechanism studies, as well as in drug screenings envisaging the development of new therapeutic approaches to minimize the effects of the glial scar in the context of central nervous system disease.",2015,,"Rocha DN, Ferraz-Nogueira JP, Barrias CC, Relvas JB, Pêgo AP.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2015.00377/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study utilized a pathogen-free laparotomy model to investigate these changes during the second trimester, as well as their response to anti-inflammatory therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>C57BL/6 pregnant mice at the 14.5-day embryo stage (E 14.5) were either exposed to sevoflurane anesthesia alone or underwent laparotomy procedure. The neuroinflammatory response was evaluated at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postnatal (P7, P14, P21, P28). Tau phosphorylation and cognitive ability were assessed at P28 and P30, respectively. The impact of perioperative administration of ibuprofen (60 mg/kg) on these aforementioned changes was subsequently evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>In the laparotomy group, levels of inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-8, IL-17A, TGF-β, M-CSF, CCL2) in the brains of offspring mice, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, remained consistently elevated from P7 to P28. At P14, while the majority of inflammatory cytokine has no statistical difference, there was still a significant reactivation of inflammatory cytokines observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus at P28. Furthermore, abnormal phosphorylation of tau and deficits in learning and memory were observed at P28 and P30. Administration of perioperative ibuprofen led to improvements in cognitive performance, reduction of systemic inflammation, and inhibiting abnormal phosphorylation of tau in the frontal cortex and hippocampus.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings indicate that cognitive dysfunction is correlated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and tau phosphorylation. Cognitive impairment and tau phosphorylation after laparotomy can persist at least until P28. Anti-inflammatory medications have been shown to enhance cognitive function by rapidly reducing inflammation in the brain, while also impacting neurological changes.

Review of the Literature.,"Headache is the third cause of visits to pediatric emergency departments (ED). According to a systematic review, headaches in children evaluated in the ED are primarily due to benign conditions that tend to be self-limiting or resolve with appropriate pharmacological treatment. The more frequent causes of non-traumatic headache in the ED include primitive headaches (21.8-66.3%) and benign secondary headaches (35.4-63.2%), whereas potentially life-threatening (LT) secondary headaches are less frequent (2-15.3%). Worrying conditions include brain tumors, central nervous system infections, dysfunction of ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and intracranial hemorrhage. In the emergency setting, the main goal is to intercept potentially LT conditions that require immediate medical attention. The initial assessment begins with an in-depth, appropriate history followed by a complete, oriented physical and neurological examination. The literature describes the following red flags requiring further investigation (for example neuroimaging) for recognition of LT conditions: abnormal neurological examination; atypical presentation of headaches: subjective vertigo, intractable vomiting or headaches that wake the child from sleep; recent and progressive severe headache (<6 months); age of the child <6 years; no family history for migraine or primary headache; occipital headache; change of headache; new headache in an immunocompromised child; first or worst headache; symptoms and signs of systemic disease; headaches associated with changes in mental status or focal neurological disorders. In evaluating a child or adolescent who is being treated for headache, physicians should consider using appropriate diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests are varied, and include routine laboratory analysis, cerebral spinal fluid examination, electroencephalography, and computerized tomography or magnetic resonance neuroimaging. The management of headache in the ED depends on the patient's general conditions and the presumable cause of the headache. There are few randomized, controlled trials on pharmacological treatment of headache in the pediatric population.

Recent advances in understanding the underlying pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia support the involvement of multiple biochemical pathways in the development of the ischemic damage. Fenamates are classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but they are also highly subunit-selective modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, activators of I<sub>KS</sub> potassium channels and antagonists of non-selective cation channels and the NLRP3 inflammosome. In the present study we investigated the effect of mefenamic acid (MFA) in a rodent model of ischemic stroke and then addressed the underlying pharmacological mechanisms <i>in vitro</i> for its actions <i>in vivo</i>. The efficacy of MFA in reducing ischemic damage was evaluated in adult male Wistar rats subjected to a 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of MFA (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) for 24 h, significantly reduced the infarct volume and the total ischemic brain damage. <i>In vitro</i>, the fenamates, MFA, meclofenamic acid, niflumic acid, and flufenamic acid each reduced glutamate-evoked excitotoxicity in cultured embryonic rat hippocampal neurons supporting the idea that this is a drug class action. In contrast the non-fenamate NSAIDs, ibuprofen and indomethacin did not reduce excitotoxicity <i>in vitro</i> indicating that neuroprotection by MFA was not dependent upon anti-inflammatory actions. Co-application of MFA (100 μM) with either of the GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists picrotoxin (100 μM) or bicuculline (10 μM) or the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (30 mM) did not prevent neuroprotection with MFA, suggesting that the actions of MFA also do not depend on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulation or potassium channel activation.

Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) is generally referred to as an unexplained prolonged fever. However, a standardized FUO definition and management is missing.<h4>Objective</h4>To collect updated data on the approach to fever and FUO among Italian pediatricians.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional anonymous survey was conducted among a large sample of primary care and hospital pediatricians. The panel group formulated and proposed a practical FUO definition, using a modified Delphi approach. A 75% consensus was required to reach an agreement.<h4>Results</h4>Among 620 respondents, paracetamol was the first-choice antipyretic for 97.7% of participants, followed by ibuprofen; 38.4% prescribed antipyretics based on a specific body temperature rather than on child's discomfort, while physical methods were almost completely abandoned. Alternate treatment was recommended by 19.8% (123/620) of participants, 16.9% (105/620) would prescribe antipyretics to prevent adverse events following immunization. Regarding FUO diagnosis, 58.3% (362/620) considered as cut-off a body temperature above 38°C; the duration required was one week according to 36.45% (226/620) of participants, two weeks according to 35.32% (219/620). The FUO definition proposed by the expert panel reached 81% of consent. Large agreement was observed on first-level laboratory and instrumental investigations in the diagnostic evaluation of FUO, whereas more discrepancies arose on second and third-level investigations. Compared to what participants reported for the treatment of non-prolonged fever, a significant decrease in the prescription of paracetamol as first-choice drug in children with FUO was observed (80.5%; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Interestingly, 39% of participants would empirically recommend antibiotics, 13.7% steroids, and 4.5% Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for persistent FUO.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Non-recommended behaviors in fever management persist among pediatricians, including alternating use of paracetamol and ibuprofen, and their prophylactic use for vaccinations. Our data confirm the variability in the definition, work-up, and management of FUO.

Consequently, a specialized team was established and a model focused on early intervention, namely the Delivery Room Intensive Care Unit (DICU) emphasizing ""care, support, and treatment"" was introduced and its impact on the morbidity and mortality outcomes of newborns was assessed. Additionally, we aimed to develop a nomogram model for predicting the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in preterm infants.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study involving 2,788 infants was conducted to compare the characteristics and outcomes of infants admitted following the transition from the previous ""neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)-centered"" approach to the current early ""care, support, and treatment"" model. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded from birth until their discharge. The primary outcome was IVH, with additional evaluation of mortality and morbidities related to the neurological, respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems.<h4>Results</h4>The DICU approach significantly declined the incidence of IVH [OR: 0.16, 95% CrI (0.11,0.23)], hypothermia [OR: 0.33, 95% CrI (0.21,0.50)], apnea [OR: 0.60, 95% CrI (0.47,0.75)], perinatal respiratory diseases [OR: 0.63, 95% CrI (0.52,0.75)] and metabolic acidosis [OR: 0.24, 95% CrI (0.16,0.34)].

However, the effects of PA in modulating immune responses in the central nervous system leading to protection against functional changes remain unexplored. Therefore, we sought to examine the protective effects of 80% v/v ethanol extract of PA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced non-spatial memory impairment and neuroinflammation. <b>Methods:</b> Selected major phytoconstituents of PA extract were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Subchronic neurotoxicity was performed in male Wistar rats given daily oral administration of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of the PA extract. Their neurobehavioral activities (functional observation battery and locomotor activity) were scored, and the extracted brains were examined for neuropathological changes. Rats were treated orally with vehicle (5% Tween 20), PA extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), or ibuprofen (IBF; 40 mg/kg) for 14 and 28 days before being subjected to novel object discrimination test. All groups were challenged with LPS (1 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally a day prior to the behavioral tests except for the negative control group. At the end of the behavioral tests, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), CD11b/c integrin expression, and synaptophysin immunoreactivity were determined in the brain tissues. <b>Results:</b> Gallic acid, ellagic acid, corilagin, geraniin, niranthin, phyllanthin, hypophyllanthin, phyltetralin, and isonirtetralin were identified in the PA extract.

The remission rates in midterm were 100%, 82%, and 57% of the full dose, half dose, and control group, respectively, and the discharged rate was 100% at the endpoint with Celebrex treatment. Celebrex significantly reduced the PGE<sub>2</sub> levels and promoted recovery of ordinary and severe COVID-19. Furthermore, more complications, severity, and death rate were widely observed and reported in the COVID-19 group of elders and with comorbidities; however, this phenomenon did not appear in this particular Celebrex adjunctive treatment study. <b>Conclusion:</b> This clinical study indicates that Celebrex adjuvant treatment promotes the recovery of all types of COVID-19 and further reduces the mortality rate of elderly and those with comorbidities.",2020,,"Hong W, Chen Y, You K, Tan S, Wu F, Tao J, Chen X, Zhang J, Xiong Y, Yuan F, Yang Z, Chen T, Chen X, Peng P, Tai Q, Wang J, Zhang F, Li YX.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.561674,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is expected that many patients will add other symptomatic/adjuvant treatments, such as herbal medicines.<h4>Aims</h4>To provide a benefits/risks assessment of selected herbal medicines traditionally indicated for ""respiratory diseases"" within the current frame of the COVID-19 pandemic as an adjuvant treatment.<h4>Method</h4>The plant selection was primarily based on species listed by the WHO and EMA, but some other herbal remedies were considered due to their widespread use in respiratory conditions. Preclinical and clinical data on their efficacy and safety were collected from authoritative sources. The target population were adults with early and mild flu symptoms without underlying conditions. These were evaluated according to a modified PrOACT-URL method with paracetamol, ibuprofen, and codeine as reference drugs. The benefits/risks balance of the treatments was classified as <i>positive</i>, <i>promising</i>, <i>negative</i>, and <i>unknown</i>.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 39 herbal medicines were identified as very likely to appeal to the COVID-19 patient. According to our method, the benefits/risks assessment of the herbal medicines was found to be positive in 5 cases (<i>Althaea officinalis, Commiphora molmol, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hedera helix</i>, and <i>Sambucus nigra</i>), promising in 12 cases (<i>Allium sativum</i>, <i>Andrographis paniculata</i>, <i>Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus</i> essential oil<i>, Justicia pectoralis, Magnolia officinalis</i>, <i>Mikania glomerata</i>, <i>Pelargonium sidoides</i>, <i>Pimpinella anisum</i>, <i>Salix</i> sp, <i>Zingiber officinale</i>), and unknown for the rest. On the same grounds, only ibuprofen resulted promising, but we could not find compelling evidence to endorse the use of paracetamol and/or codeine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our work suggests that several herbal medicines have safety margins superior to those of reference drugs and enough levels of evidence to start a clinical discussion about their potential use as adjuvants in the treatment of early/mild common flu in otherwise healthy adults within the context of COVID-19. While these herbal medicines will not cure or prevent the flu, they may both improve general patient well-being and offer them an opportunity to personalize the therapeutic approaches.",2020,,"Silveira D, Prieto-Garcia JM, Boylan F, Estrada O, Fonseca-Bazzo YM, Jamal CM, Magalhães PO, Pereira EO, Tomczyk M, Heinrich M.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.581840,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Current evidence point to COX-1 inhibition as one of the main factors in its etiopathogenesis. Evidence also suggests that the risk is dose-dependent. Therefore it could be speculated that individuals with impaired NSAID biodisposition might be at increased risk of developing cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. We analyzed common functional gene variants for <i>CYP2C8, CYP2C9,</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> in a large cohort composed of 499 patients with cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and 624 healthy individuals who tolerated NSAIDs. Patients were analyzed as a whole group and subdivided in three groups according to the main enzymes involved in the metabolism of the culprit drugs as follows: CYP2C9, aceclofenac, indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, meloxicam, lornoxicam, and celecoxib; CYP2C8 plus CYP2C9, ibuprofen and diclofenac; CYP2C19 plus CYP2C9, metamizole. Genotype calls ranged from 94 to 99%. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls were identified in this study, either for allele frequencies, diplotypes, or inferred phenotypes. After patient stratification according to the enzymes involved in the metabolism of the culprit drugs, or according to the clinical presentation of the hypersensitivity reaction, we identified weak significant associations of a lower frequency (as compared to that of control subjects) of <i>CYP2C8*3/*3</i> genotypes in patients receiving NSAIDs that are predominantly CYP2C9 substrates, and in patients with NSAIDs-exacerbated cutaneous disease. However, these associations lost significance after False Discovery Rate correction for multiple comparisons. Taking together these findings and the statistical power of this cohort, we conclude that there is no evidence of a major implication of the major functional <i>CYP2C</i> polymorphisms analyzed in this study and the risk of developing cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. This argues against the hypothesis of a dose-dependent COX-1 inhibition as the main underlying mechanism for this adverse drug event and suggests that pre-emptive genotyping aiming at drug selection should have a low practical utility for cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs.",2021,,"Macías Y, García-Menaya JM, Martí M, Cordobés C, Jurado-Escobar R, Cornejo-García JA, Torres MJ, Blanca-López N, Canto G, Blanca M, Laguna JJ, Bartra J, Rosado A, Fernández J, García-Martín E, Agúndez JAG.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.648262,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Additionally, the safety profiles of these drug treatments need to be documented and shared with the public. Some studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment. On the contrary, others have also reported that NSAIDs and corticosteroids may worsen symptoms associated with COVID-19. While some researchers have suggested that corticosteroids may be helpful if used in the early stages of COVID-19, there are still some conflicting findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in certain viral infections. Our review suggests that methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and ibuprofen have therapeutic potential in reducing mortality due to COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. This review also highlights the fact that the use of NSAIDs is not associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19. In reality, evidence suggests that NSAIDs do not increase the risk of COVID-19 infections.

Current anticonvulsants primarily target ion channels and receptors implicated in seizure activity. Identification of neurotherapeutics that can inhibit epileptiform activity and reduce inflammation in the brain may offer significant benefits in the long-term management of epilepsy. Fenamates are unique because they are both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and highly subunit selective modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. In the current study we have investigated the hypothesis that fenamates have antiseizure properties using mature human stem cell-derived neuro-glia cell cultures, maintained in long-term culture, and previously shown to be sensitive to first, second and third generation antiepileptics. Mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, niflumic acid, and tolfenamic acid (each tested at 10-100 μM) attenuated 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 100 μM) evoked epileptiform activity in a dose-dependent fashion. These actions were as effective diazepam (3-30 μM) and up to 200 times more potent than phenobarbital (300-1,000 μM). The low (micromolar) concentrations of fenamates that inhibited 4-AP evoked epileptiform activity correspond to those reported to potentiate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function. In contrast, the fenamates had no effect on neural spike amplitudes, indicating that their antiseizure actions did not result from inhibition of sodium-channels. The antiseizure actions of fenamates were also not replicated by either of the two non-fenamate NSAIDs, ibuprofen (10-100 μM) or indomethacin (10-100 μM), indicating that inhibition of cyclooxygenases is not the mechanism through which fenamates have anticonvulsant properties. This study therefore shows for the first time, using functionally mature human stem cell-derived neuroglial circuits, that fenamate NSAIDs have powerful antiseizure actions independent of, and in addition to their well-established anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting these drugs may provide a novel insight and new approach to the treatment of epilepsy in the future.",2024,,"Salmanzadeh H, Halliwell RF.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1385523,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is characterized by generalized slowness of movement, resting tremor or stiffness, and bradykinesia. PD patients' brains mostly exhibit an increase in inflammatory mediators and microglial response. Nevertheless, a variety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) offered neuroprotection in animal models and preclinical trials. <b>Aim:</b> The current systematic review and meta-analysis were designed to try to resolve the debate over the association of NSAID use with the development of PD because the results of several studies were somehow contradictory. <b>Methods:</b> An intense search was performed on Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for articles relating the incidence of PD to the use of NSAIDs. Statistical analysis of the included studies was carried out using Review Manager version 5.4.1 by random effect model. The outcome was identified as the development of PD in patients who were on NSAIDs, ibuprofen only, aspirin only, and non-aspirin NSAIDs. This was analyzed using pooled analysis of odds ratio (OR) at a significance level of ≤0.05 and a confidence level of 95%. A statistically significant decreased risk of PD was observed in patients taking NSAIDs, Ibuprofen, and non-aspirin NSAIDs. <b>Results:</b> The ORs of PD occurrence in patients who took NSAIDs, Ibuprofen, and non-aspirin NSAIDs were 0.88 [95% CI (0.8-0.97), <i>p</i> = 0.01], 0.73 [95% CI (0.53-1), <i>p</i> = 0.05] and 0.85 [95% CI (0.75-0.97), <i>p</i> = 0.01]. Meanwhile, the risk of PD in patients who took aspirin was not statistically significant. <b>Conclusion:</b> In conclusion, Ibuprofen, non-aspirin NSAIDs, and other types of NSAIDs could be associated with a reduction in PD risk.

G-quadruplex (G4) motifs in promoter regions have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. This study explores G4 stabilization in the GLI1 promoter as a novel strategy to suppress gastric cancer progression.<h4>Methods</h4>G4 formation in the GLI1 promoter was validated using circular dichroism. A dual-luciferase assay screened FDA-approved drugs for G4-stabilizing activity, identifying alpha-estradiol and (R)-(-)-ibuprofen as candidates. These compounds were evaluated for anti-tumor effects through in vitro assays (proliferation, migration, invasion) and in vivo xenograft models. Mechanistic insights into GLI1/PRKACB signaling were obtained via chromatin immunoprecipitation and pathway analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Stable G4 structures were confirmed in the GLI1 promoter. Alpha-estradiol and (R)-(-)-ibuprofen suppressed GLI1 transcription and protein levels, significantly inhibiting gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness. In vivo, both compounds reduced tumor growth and metastasis, with (R)-(-)-ibuprofen synergizing with cisplatin to enhance efficacy. Mechanistically, GLI1 directly regulated PRKACB expression, and G4 stabilization downregulated PRKACB, impairing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Targeting GLI1 G4 structures with alpha-estradiol and (R)-(-)-ibuprofen effectively inhibits gastric cancer progression by blocking GLI1/PRKACB signaling.

Pharmacological treatment of combined infectious and inflammatory diseases requires the administration of multiple drugs, including antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. However, this can cause adverse effects, and therefore, dual-action drugs need to be developed. Anti-inflammatory drugs that have already shown antimicrobial properties appear to be promising candidates. NSAIDs, namely aceclofenac, diclofenac, and ibuprofen, were tested in clinical trials with patients diagnosed with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) and cellulitis. The administration of ibuprofen, a drug tested in the highest number of studies, resulted in symptom resolution in patients with UTIs. Additionally, ibuprofen caused a high survival rate in mice infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and demonstrated potent <i>in vitro</i> antibacterial effects against <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> including methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) (MIC 0.625-2.5 mg/L). For most anti-inflammatory drugs, only data showing their <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antimicrobial effects are available. Among these, auranofin caused a high survival rate in mice infected with <i>Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus,</i> and <i>Clostridioides difficile.</i> It also produced a strong <i>in vitro</i> growth-inhibitory effect against <i>Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, C. difficile, E. faecalis, E. faecium,</i> and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MIC 0.0015-5 mg/L). Similarly, aspirin caused a high survival rate in <i>M. tuberculosis-</i>infected mice and strong to moderate <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>E. coli</i>, <i>B. cereus</i>, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Salmonella choleraesuis</i> (MIC 1.2-5 mg/L). Moreover, topical application of celecoxib resulted in a high reduction in MRSA burden in mice. However, it only caused moderate <i>in vitro</i> effects against <i>S. epidermidis</i>, <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>Bacillus subitilis</i> (MIC 16-64 mg/L). These data suggest that certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are promising drug candidates for the development of dual-action drugs for the potential treatment of combined infectious and inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, musculoskeletal infections and UTIs.

As a secondary aim, we compared the effects of eccentric overload with conventional training. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty participants were randomized to either a group taking high doses (3 × 400 mg/day) of ibuprofen (IBU; 27 ± 5 year; <i>n</i> = 11) or a group ingesting a low dose (1 × 75 mg/day) of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; 26 ± 4 year; <i>n</i> = 9) during 8 weeks of supervised knee extensor resistance training. Each of the subject's legs were randomized to complete the training program using either a flywheel (FW) device emphasizing eccentric overload, or a traditional weight stack machine (WS). Maximal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (CI+II<sub>P</sub>) from permeabilized skeletal muscle bundles was assessed using high-resolution respirometry. Citrate synthase (CS) activity was assessed using spectrophotometric techniques and mitochondrial protein content using western blotting. <b>Results:</b> After training, CI+II<sub>P</sub> decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in both IBU (23%) and ASA (29%) with no difference across medical treatments. Although CI+II<sub>P</sub> decreased in both legs, the decrease was greater (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.015) in WS (33%, <i>p</i> = 0.001) compared with FW (19%, <i>p</i> = 0.078). CS activity increased (<i>p</i> = 0.027) with resistance training, with no interactions with medical treatment or training modality. Protein expression of ULK1 increased with training in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The increase in quadriceps muscle volume was not correlated with changes in CI+II<sub>P</sub> (<i>R</i> = 0.16). <b>Conclusion:</b> These results suggest that 8 weeks of resistance training with co-ingestion of anti-inflammatory drugs reduces mitochondrial function but increases mitochondrial content. The observed changes were not affected by higher doses of NSAIDs consumption, suggesting that the resistance training intervention was the prime mediator of the decreased mitochondrial phosphorylation.

The primary therapeutic mechanism of these widely used drugs is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX1, 2) enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. At higher doses, NSAIDs are used for prevention of certain types of cancer and as experimental treatments for Alzheimer's disease. In the immune system, various NSAIDs have been reported to influence neutrophil function and lymphocyte proliferation, and affect ion channels and cellular calcium homeostasis. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) cation channels are highly expressed in T lymphocytes and are inhibited by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, acidic pH, and polyamines. Here, we report a novel effect of naproxen, ibuprofen, salicylate, and acetylsalicylate on TRPM7. At concentrations of 3-30mM, they reversibly inhibited TRPM7 channel currents. By measuring intracellular pH with the ratiometric indicator BCECF, we found that at 300μM to 30mM, these NSAIDs reversibly acidified the cytoplasm in a concentration-dependent manner, and propose that TRPM7 channel inhibition is a consequence of cytosolic acidification, rather than direct. NSAID inhibition of TRPM7 channels was slow, voltage-independent, and displayed use-dependence, increasing in potency upon repeated drug applications. The extent of channel inhibition by salicylate strongly depended on cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, as revealed when this phospholipid was depleted with voltage-sensitive lipid phosphatase (VSP). Salicylate inhibited heterologously expressed wildtype TRPM7 channels but not the S1107R variant, which is insensitive to cytosolic pH, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion. NSAID-induced acidification was also observed in Schneider 2 cells from <i>Drosophila</i>, an organism that lacks orthologous COX genes, suggesting that this effect is unrelated to COX enzyme activity. A 24-h exposure to 300μM-10mM naproxen resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in cell viability.

The Lake Massaciuccoli located in Tuscany (Italy) is one of the largest swamps that in ancient times entirely covered the Versilia coastal plain. Despite its peculiar features, especially the eutrophic characteristics, its native microalgal consortia have never been explored up to now. In this work, we isolated and described four autochthonous microalgal strains from different sites in the lake (FB, Idr, CL_Sc, and CL_Ch); the four microalgal strains were identified within the <i>Chlorella sorokiniana</i> clade. We exposed them to ten of the most common or emerging environmental contaminants in order to describe their preliminary response to the tested substances: five metals (As, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn), two herbicides (Metolachlor and Sethoxydim), two antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Benzylpenicillin) and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Ibuprofen). Physiological response of the strains highlighted intraspecific differences; strain CL_Sc was the most tolerant in presence of metals while strain Idr was the most sensitive. All strains were sensitive to sethoxydim and tolerant to metolachlor at all the tested concentrations. Strains FB and Idr were the most sensitive in presence of Ibuprofen while strain CL_Ch was the most sensitive to the highest Benzylpenicillin concentration. Resistance pattern of strain Idr somehow reflects both the phylogenetic and the geographic ""isolation"" from all other three strains.

APAP and IBU are over-the-counter drugs and are among the most commonly taken drugs in the first trimester of pregnancy, even in combination. Furthermore, these drugs and their metabolites are released in the environment, and can be frequently detected in wastewater, surface water, and importantly in drinking water. Although their environmental concentrations are much lower than the therapeutics doses, this suggests an uncontrolled low-dose exposure of the general population, including pregnant women and young children, two particularly at risk populations. Epidemiological studies show that exposure to these molecules in the first and second trimester of gestation can favor genital malformations in new-born boys. To investigate the cellular, molecular and mechanistic effects of exposure to these molecules, <i>ex vivo</i> studies with human or rodent gonadal explants and <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rodents have been performed in the past years. This review recapitulates recent data obtained in rodent models after <i>in utero</i> or postnatal exposure to these drugs. The first part of this review discusses the mechanisms by which NSAIDs and analgesics may impair gonadal development and maturation, puberty development, sex hormone production, maturation and function of adult organs, and ultimately fertility in the exposed animals and their offspring. Like other endocrine disruptors, NSAIDs and APAP interfere with endocrine gland function and may have inter/transgenerational adverse effects.

However, challenges arise when using ECBP for small dogs and cats because the priming volume required by most machine-based ECBP platforms might be excessive, leading to cardiovascular instability if a blood prime is not used. This report describes the successful use of manual carbon hemoperfusion (MCHP) to reduce plasma meloxicam levels in a cat following an inadvertent overdose and its use in a dog following suspected ibuprofen ingestion. In both animals, MCHP reduced the circuit volume needed for ECBP from 125 mL with a machine-based therapeutic plasma exchange or 104 mL with an in-series carbon hemoperfusion on an intermittent hemodialysis platform to just 40-50 mL. In the cat, MCHP reduced plasma meloxicam levels by 44%, and in both animals, the use of MCHP in these pets was well-tolerated and safe. Due to pre-existing anemia, the cat required a blood transfusion but the dog did not. MCHP is technically simple and can be performed at any hospital with access to carbon filters and blood bank resources. This technique may represent a reasonable alternative to treat NSAID toxicities in animals that are too small for conventional extracorporeal decontamination methods using either machine-based platforms without using a blood prime or in locations where these machines are unavailable.",2024,,"Haire LE, Vitalo AD, Gonçalves RP, Lanaux TM.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2024.1395967,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite many years of methodological improvements, the pregnancy rate (PR) in cows has not increased in direct proportion with their development. Among the possibilities to increase the PR is the use of certain steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The antiluteolytic effect of NSAIDs is achieved by blocking cyclooxygenase, which is involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. This article compares the PRs obtained after treatment with the commonly used NSAIDs in cattle, including flunixin meglumine, carprofen, meloxicam, ibuprofen, aspirin, and sildenafil. Studies on the effectiveness of certain steroid drugs on the PR have also been described. The results were not always consistent, and so comparisons between studies were made. In conclusion, flunixin meglumine seems to be an option, and can be recommended for improving ET results, especially in situations of high exposure or susceptibility to stress.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appear to be a therapeutic alternative to control biofilm infection. The objective of this work is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of sodium diclofenac (DCS), ibuprofen (IBP) and ibuprofen arginine (IBP-arginine) solutions against endodontic polymicrobial biofilms. Sterile radicular dentin blocks of 4 mm × 4 mm × 0.7 mm were used as substrate to grow biofilm. The dentin blocks were submerged into solutions for 5 min. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by means of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Fibroblasts 3T3-L1 (ECACC 86052701) were used to test the cytotoxicity of irrigating solutions. The antibiofilm effects determined by the ATP assay showed that 4% IBP-arginine solution exerted the highest antibiofilm activity, followed by 4% DCS and 4% IBP, with statistical differences among groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). As for CLSM, 4% DCS and 4% IBP-arginine solutions gave the lowest viable cell percentages, without significant differences between them. Cytotoxicity results at 1/10 dilution were similar for all solutions. At 1/100 dilution, a 4% DCS solution obtained the lowest cell viability for both time periods assayed, 1 h and 24 h. The IBP-arginine group showed the highest cell viability at 24 h.

Co-medication with omeprazole (OMP) is the most commonly used option to prevent these lesions, although this carries risks of its own; thus, alternatives are being explored, such as dietary antioxidant therapies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gastroprotective activity of quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd.) on ibuprofen (IBP)-induced gastric ulcers in a rat model. Quinoa cookies were formulated with heat-treated quinoa using microwave radiation. The intestinal bioaccessibility of phenols and flavonoids, and the antioxidant activity of microwaved quinoa cookies (MQCs) were notably higher than quinoa cookies without thermal treatment (RQCs): 132% TPC, 52% TFC, 1564% TEAC vs. 67% TPC, 24% TFC, and 958% TEAC, respectively. Basal diets were supplemented with MQCs (20%) and quercetin (Q, 0.20%) as a reference flavonoid and administered for 30 days. Gastric lesions were induced by intragastric IBP doses, with OMP treatment as a positive control. Gastric damage index (macroscopic study), histological score (microscopic study), and plasma antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD and CAT) were evaluated. Macroscopic results showed that the addition of MQCs, Q, and OMP decreased the gastric damage index (GDI) by 50%, 40%, and 3%, respectively, as compared to IBP (GDI 100%). Histological analyses showed neutrophil infiltration and congested blood vessels in IBP-treated tissues; in contrast, the experimental diet groups showed lower infiltration for MQC > OMP > Q, respectively.

Thus, we assessed the effect of citral (25, 100, and 300 mg/kg) and ibuprofen in LPS-induced SI in Swiss male mice fed a standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Following SI induction, we measured Tb and collected the serum, hypothalamus, and gastric mucosa for biochemical measurements. Acute treatment with citral decreased the Tb of both SD and HFD-fed animals. Citral (300 mg/kg) treatment caused a significantly lower Tb variation in HFD-fed animals than in those fed the SD. Citral reduced peripheral levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in SD and HFD mice and decreased serum leptin concentration in HFD mice 90 min after the LPS challenge.

Microglial activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This study aimed to characterize the role of microglial activation in aging-related nigral DA neuron loss and motor deficits in mice. We showed that, compared to 3-month-old mice, the number of DA neurons in the SN and the expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum decreased during the period of 9 to 12 months of age. Motor deficits and microglial activation in the SN were also evident during these months. The number of DA neurons was negatively correlated with the degrees of microglial activation. The inhibition of age-related microglial activation by ibuprofen during these 3 months decreased DA neuron loss in the SN. Eliminating the microglia prevented systemic inflammation-induced DA neuron death. Forcing mice to run during these 3 months inhibited microglial activation and DA neuron loss. Blocking the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling eliminated the exercise-induced protective effects. In conclusion, nigral DA neurons were susceptible to local microglial activation. Running exercise upregulated BDNF-TrkB signaling and inhibited microglial activation during aging.

At present, no drug treatments are routinely given in the clinic following a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) to improve regeneration and remyelination of damaged nerves. Appropriately targeted therapeutic agents have the potential to be used at different stages following nerve damage, e.g., to maintain Schwann cell viability, induce and sustain a repair phenotype to support axonal growth, or promote remyelination. The development of therapies to promote nerve regeneration is currently of high interest to researchers, however, translation to the clinic of drug therapies for PNI is still lacking. Studying the effect of PPARγ agonists for treatment of peripheral nerve injures has demonstrated significant benefits. Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has reproducibly demonstrated benefits in vitro and in vivo, suggested to be due to its agonist action on PPARγ. Other NSAIDs have demonstrated differing levels of PPARγ activation based upon their affinity. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether affinity for PPARγ of selected drugs corresponded to an increase in regeneration. A 3D co-culture in vitro model identified some correlation between these two properties. However, when the drug treatments were screened in vivo, in a crush injury model in a rat sciatic nerve, the same correlation was not apparent. Further differences were observed between capacity to increase axon number and improvement in functional recovery.

The structures required to feel pain are developed at 24 weeks of gestation. However, pain assessment is complicated, especially in neonates, infants and preschool-age children. Clinical scales adapted to age are the most used methods for assessing and monitoring the degree of pain in children. They evaluate several behavioral and/or physiological parameters related to pain. Some monitors detect the physiological changes that occur in association with painful stimuli, but they do not yet have a clear clinical use. Multimodal analgesia is recommended for pain treatment with non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. It is necessary to establish pharmacotherapeutic protocols for analgesia adjusted to the acute or chronic, type and intensity of pain, as well as age. The most used analgesics in children are paracetamol, ibuprofen, dipyrone, opioids (morphine and fentanyl) and local anesthetics. Patient-controlled analgesia is an adequate alternative for adolescent and older children in specific situations, such as after surgery.

To address these limitations, we developed a novel hybrid eutectogel composed of xanthan gum (XTG), hyaluronic acid (HA), and a Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent (NADES) system (choline chloride, sorbitol, and glycerol in 2:1:1 mole ratio), incorporating 2.5% ibuprofen (IBU) as a model drug. The formulation was optimized using a face-centered central composite design to enhance the rheological, textural, and drug release properties. The optimized eutectogels exhibited shear-thinning behavior (flow behavior index, <i>n</i> = 0.26 ± 0.01), high mucoadhesion (adhesiveness: 2.297 ± 0.142 N·s), and sustained drug release over 24 h, governed by Higuchi kinetics (release rate: 237.34 ± 13.61 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>/min<sup>1/2</sup>). The ex vivo residence time increased substantially with NADES incorporation, reaching up to 176.7 ± 23.1 min. An in vivo anti-inflammatory evaluation showed that the eutectogel reduced λ-carrageenan-induced paw edema within 1 h and that its efficacy was sustained in the kaolin model up to 24 h (<i>p</i> < 0.05), achieving comparable efficacy to a commercial 5% IBU gel, despite a lower drug concentration. Additionally, the eutectogel presented a minimum inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria of 25 mg/mL, and through direct contact, it reduced microbial viability by up to 100%. Its efficacy against <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>, and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, combined with its significant anti-inflammatory properties, positions the NADES-based eutectogel as a promising multifunctional platform for buccal drug delivery, particularly for inflammatory conditions complicated by bacterial infections.",2025,,"Anuța V, Nica MA, Prisada RM, Popa L, Velescu BȘ, Marinas IC, Gaboreanu DM, Ghica MV, Cocoș FI, Nicolae CA, Dinu-Pîrvu CE.",https://doi.org/10.3390/gels11030208,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The structural characterization of these systems is crucial for the development of new drug delivery systems and for the optimization of their properties. In this study, we utilized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate the structures of poloxamer-based drug delivery systems. The samples were measured using the SANS technique on the VSANS-V16 instrument at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), Germany. The samples contained 20% poloxamer (P407) and 0.2% of a drug (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac) in deuterated water (D<sub>2</sub>O) for SANS. The samples varied in terms of temperature analysis (25 °C, common storage temperature; 37 °C, human body temperature; 40 °C, fever temperature). The data analysis involved modeling the data using a Python-based routine. The model used consisted of an isotropic solution of polydisperse spherical micelles. The intensity as a function of the scattering vector was modeled as the product of the form factor and the interparticle structure factor, with the latter described within the local monodisperse approximation regime. Additionally, a scattering contribution was observed, which was associated with the presence of crystalline superstructures formed by micelles that organized into a cubic structure. The data analysis provided important information about the system, such as the average radius, the size distribution, and the thickness of the layer surrounding the micellar core.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop dressings with fast antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity that shorten the wound healing period by promoting cell migration and proliferation. Chitosan (CS)-based hydrogels have been widely studied for their antibacterial and wound healing capabilities. Herein, we developed a composite hydrogel based on CS and PVA embedding silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with antibacterial properties and ibuprofen (Ib) as an anti-inflammatory agent. The hydrogel prepared by double physical cross-linking, with oxalic acid and by freeze-thawing, loaded with 0.225 wt.% AgNPs and 0.264 wt.% Ib, displayed good mechanical properties (compressive modulus = 132 kPa), a high swelling degree and sustained drug delivery (in simulated skin conditions). Moreover, the hydrogel showed strong antibacterial activity against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> due to the embedded AgNPs. In vivo, this hydrogel accelerated the wound regeneration process through the enhanced expression of TNF alpha IP8, by activating downstream cascades and supporting the healing process of inflammation; Cox2, which enhances the migration and proliferation of cells involved in re-epithelization and angiogenesis; MHCII, which promotes immune cooperation between local cells, eliminating dead tissue and controlling infection; the intense expression of Col I as a major marker in the tissue granulation process; and αSMA, which marks the presence of myofibroblasts involved in wound closure and indicates ongoing re-epithelization.

Objective: To analyze whether IBU would affect performance and the immune system after training in PP. Methodology: 10 athletes at the national level (NL) and 10 at the regional level (RL) participated in the study, where force and blood indicators were evaluated after training. The study took place over three weeks: (1) familiarization and (2 and 3) comparison between recovery methods, with ibuprofen or placebo (IBU vs. PLA), 800 mg. In the evaluation of the force, the peak torque (PT), fatigue index (FI), and blood immune system biomarkers were analyzed. The training consisted of five sets of five repetitions with 80% of one maximum repetition (5 × 5, 80% 1RM) on the bench press. Results: The PT at the national level using IBU was higher than with PLA (p = 0.007, η2p = 0.347), and the FI in the NL was lower with IBU than with PLA (p = 0.002, η2p = 0.635), and when comparing the use of IBU, the NL showed less fatigue than the regional level (p = 0.004, η2p = 0.414). Leukocytes, with the use of IBU in the NL group, were greater than in the RL (p = 0.001, η2p = 0.329).

Many methods-including pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and micro-assisted extraction (MAE)-have been employed for their extraction from both surface waters and biota. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) proved to be the best extraction method for these polar, non-volatile, and thermally unstable compounds in water. However, ultrasonic extraction works better for their isolation from sediment because it is cheap and consumes less solvent, even though SPE is preferred as a clean-up method for sediment samples. PPCPs are in groups of-acidic (e.g., diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen), neutral (e.g., caffeine, carbamazepine, fluoxetine), and basic pharmaceuticals, as well as antibiotics and estrogens amongst others. PPCPs which are present in trace levels (ng/L) are more often determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolent (HPLC-UV). Of these, LC-MS and LC-MS-MS are mostly employed for the analysis of this class of compounds, though not without a draw-back of matrix effect.

The very large number of CECs reported in the literature makes it difficult to interpret potential risks as well as the removal efficiencies, especially for the more recalcitrant compounds. As such, there is a need for indicator compounds that are representative of CECs detected in systems worldwide. In an effort to develop such a list, five criteria were used to address the potential for applying indicator compounds; these criteria include usage, occurrence, resistance to treatment, persistence, and physicochemical properties that shed light on the potential degradability of a class of compounds. Additional constraints applied included the feasibility of procuring and analyzing compounds. In total, 22 CECs belonging to 13 groups were selected as indicator compounds. These compounds include acetaminophen and ibuprofen (analgesic); erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim (antibiotics); diazepam and fluoxetine (antidepressants); carbamazepine (antiepileptic); atenolol and propranolol (β-blockers); gemfibrozil (blood lipid regulator); tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) (fire retardant); cotinine (nicotine metabolite); atrazine, metolachlor, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (pesticides); 17β-estradiol and cholesterol (steroids); caffeine (psychomotor stimulant); perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (surfactants); and iopromide (X-ray contrast agent). These thirteen groups of compounds represent CECs with the greatest resistance to treatment processes, most persistent in surface waters, and detected with significant frequency throughout the water cycle.

The results showed that most of the target metabolites and their parents were detected in all water samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 ng/L to 72.9 ng/L. In some cases, the concentrations of metabolites in water were significantly higher than their parents, with fold changes reaching up 4.1 in the wet season and 6.6 in the dry season, while in sediment and fish, a lower concentration was observed in most cases. A lowered concentration of detected pharmaceuticals was observed in the dry season when compared to the wet season due to the seasonal variation in pharmaceutical consumption and overflow effluent. The bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in different fish tissues were detected with a descending order of overall concentration as gill > brain > muscle > gonad > intestine > liver > blood. In addition, the concentrations of both metabolites and their parents also decreased along the river in two seasons. However, the concentration rates of metabolites and their parents were significantly altered along the river in both water and sediment. The relatively high concentration proportions of the detected pharmaceuticals in water suggested that pharmaceuticals were more likely to apportion in water than in sediment, especially for the metabolites. Meanwhile, the rates of the metabolite/parent pairs between fish and water/sediment were generally lower, indicating the higher excretion capacity of metabolites from fish than their parents. Most of the detected pharmaceuticals had no impact on aquatic organisms. However, the presence of ibuprofen posed a medium risk to fish.

To meet this need, hyaluronic acid (HA)/ibuprofen (IBU) (HAI) NFMs were prepared by electrospinning, followed by dual ionic crosslinking with FeCl<sub>3</sub> (HAIF NFMs) and covalent crosslinking with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to produce HAIFB NFMs. It is expected that the multi-functional NFMs will act as a physical barrier to prevent fibroblast penetration, HA will reduce fibroblast attachment and impart a lubrication effect for tendon gliding, while IBU will function as an anti-inflammation drug. For this purpose, we successfully fabricated HAIFB NFMs containing 20% (HAI20FB), 30% (HAI30FB), and 40% (HAI40FB) IBU and characterized their physico-chemical properties by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and mechanical testing. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that all NFMs except HAI40FB possessed excellent effects in preventing fibroblast attachment and penetration while preserving high biocompatibility without influencing cell proliferation. Although showing significant improvement in mechanical properties over other NFMs, the HAI40FB NFM exhibited cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts due to the higher percentage and concentration of IBU released form the membrane.

The accelerating occurrence of AD is expected to reach 65.7 million by 2030. The disease results in neural atrophy and disrupted inter-neuronal connections. Amongst multiple AD pathogenesis hypotheses, the amyloid beta (Aβ) cascade is the most relevant and accepted form of the hypothesis, which suggests that Aβ monomers are formed as a result of the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), followed by the conversion of these monomers to toxic oligomers, which in turn develop β-sheets, fibrils and plaques. The review targets the events in the amyloid hypothesis and elaborates suitable therapeutic agents that function by hindering the steps of plaque formation and lowering Aβ levels in the brain. The authors discuss treatment possibilities, including the inhibition of β- and γ-secretase-mediated enzymatic cleavage of APP, the immune response generating active immunotherapy and passive immunotherapeutic approaches targeting monoclonal antibodies towards Aβ aggregates, the removal of amyloid aggregates by the activation of enzymatic pathways or the regulation of Aβ circulation, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-mediated curbed accumulation and the neurotoxic potential of Aβ aggregates, bapineuzumab-mediated vascular permeability alterations, statin-mediated Aβ peptide degradation, the potential role of ibuprofen and the significance of natural drugs and dyes in hindering the amyloid cascade events.

The etiology and pathogenesis underlying the emergence of PD is still obscure. However, expanding corroboration encourages the involvement of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of PD. The destruction of numerous cellular components, namely oxidative stress, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction, autophagy-lysosome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation and programmed cell death, and mitochondrial dysfunction partake in the pathogenesis of PD. Present-day pharmacotherapy can alleviate the manifestations, but no therapy has been demonstrated to cease disease progression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-directed transcription factors pertaining to the class of nuclear hormone receptors (NHR), and are implicated in the modulation of mitochondrial operation, inflammation, wound healing, redox equilibrium, and metabolism of blood sugar and lipids. Numerous PPAR agonists have been recognized to safeguard nerve cells from oxidative destruction, inflammation, and programmed cell death in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, various investigations suggest that regular administration of PPAR-activating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen, indomethacin), and leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast) were related to the de-escalated evolution of neurodegenerative diseases. The present review elucidates the emerging evidence enlightening the neuroprotective outcomes of PPAR agonists in in vivo and in vitro models experiencing PD. Existing articles up to the present were procured through PubMed, MEDLINE, etc., utilizing specific keywords spotlighted in this review. Furthermore, the authors aim to provide insight into the neuroprotective actions of PPAR agonists by outlining the pharmacological mechanism.

Clay adsorbents have been repeatedly proposed as adsorbents for treatment purposes, but natural clays are hydrophilic and can be inefficient for catching hydrophobic pharmaceuticals. In this paper, a comparison of adsorption properties of pristine montmorillonite (MMT) and montmorillonite modified with stearyl trimethyl ammonium (hydrophobic MMT-STA) towards carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and paracetamol pharmaceuticals was performed. The efficiency of adsorption was investigated under varying solution pH, temperature, contact time, initial concentration of pharmaceuticals, and adsorbate/adsorbent mass ratio. MMT-STA was better than pristine MMT at removing all the pharmaceuticals studied. The adsorption capacity of hydrophobic montmorillonite to pharmaceuticals decreased in the following order: carbamazepine (97%) > ibuprofen (95%) > paracetamol (63-67%). Adsorption isotherms were best described by Freundlich model. Within the pharmaceutical concentration range of 10-50 µg/mL, the most optimal mass ratio of adsorbates to adsorbents was 1:300, pH 6, and a temperature of 25 °C. Thus, MMT-STA could be used as an efficient adsorbent for deconta×ating water of carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and paracetamol.",2021,,"Kryuchkova M, Batasheva S, Akhatova F, Babaev V, Buzyurova D, Vikulina A, Volodkin D, Fakhrullin R, Rozhina E.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/18/9670/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

There are currently no drugs that can successfully treat this disease. This study first explored the anti-inflammatory activity of seven components isolated from <i>Antrodia cinnamonmea</i> in BV2 cells and selected EK100 and antrodin C for in vivo research. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were treated with EK100 and antrodin C for one month to evaluate the effect of these reagents on AD-like pathology by nesting behavior, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. Ergosterol and ibuprofen were used as control. EK100 and antrodin C improved the nesting behavior of mice, reduced the number and burden of amyloid plaques, reduced the activation of glial cells, and promoted the perivascular deposition of Aβ in the brain of mice. EK100 and antrodin C are significantly different in activating astrocytes, regulating microglia morphology, and promoting plaque-associated microglia to express oxidative enzymes. In contrast, the effects of ibuprofen and ergosterol are relatively small. In addition, EK100 significantly improved hippocampal neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Our data indicate that EK100 and antrodin C reduce the pathology of AD by reducing amyloid deposits and promoting nesting behavior in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice through microglia and perivascular clearance, indicating that EK100 and antrodin C have the potential to be used in AD treatment.",2021,,"Tsay HJ, Liu HK, Kuo YH, Chiu CS, Liang CC, Chung CW, Chen CC, Chen YP, Shiao YJ.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/19/10413/pdf?version=1632962484,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Early in the pandemic, there was speculation that a number of commonly used medications-including ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-have the potential to upregulate ACE2, thereby possibly facilitating viral entry and increasing the severity of COVID-19. We investigated the influence of the NSAIDS with a range of cyclooxygenase (COX)1 and COX2 selectivity (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, etoricoxib) and paracetamol on the level of ACE2 mRNA/protein expression and activity as well as their influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection levels in a Caco-2 cell model. We also analysed the ACE2 mRNA/protein levels and activity in lung, heart and aorta in ibuprofen treated mice. The drugs had no effect on ACE2 mRNA/protein expression and activity in the Caco-2 cell model. There was no up-regulation of ACE2 mRNA/protein expression and activity in lung, heart and aorta tissue in ibuprofen-treated mice in comparison to untreated mice. Viral load was significantly reduced by both flurbiprofen and ibuprofen at high concentrations.

New indications for drugs used in various conditions are being discovered. Non-opioid analgesics are worth noting as very popular, widely available, relatively cheap medications. They also have the ability to modulate the membrane components of tumor cells. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol on skin and gastrointestinal cancers cell membrane. These drugs may affect the membrane through topical application, at the in vitro and in vivo level after oral or parenteral administration. They can lead to up- or downregulated expression of receptors, transporters and other molecules associated with plasma membrane. Medications may also alter the lipid bilayer composition of membrane, resulting in changes in its integrity and fluidity. Described modulations can cause the visualization of cancer cells, enhanced response of the immune system and the initiation of cell death.

Exposure of pregnant mice to NSAID therapeutic doses during the sex determination period has a negative impact on gonadal development and fertility in adults; however, the effects of their chronic exposure at lower doses are unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic exposure to a mixture containing ibuprofen, 2hydroxy-ibuprofen, diclofenac, and EE2 at two environmentally relevant doses (added to the drinking water from fetal life until puberty) on the reproductive tract in F1 exposed mice and their F2 offspring. In F1 animals, exposure delayed male puberty and accelerated female puberty. In post-pubertal F1 testes and ovaries, differentiation/maturation of the different gonad cell types was altered, and some of these modifications were observed also in the non-exposed F2 generation. Transcriptomic analysis of post-pubertal testes and ovaries of F1 (exposed) and F2 animals revealed significant changes in gene expression profiles and enriched pathways, particularly the inflammasome, metabolism and extracellular matrix pathways, compared with controls (non-exposed). This suggested that exposure to these drug cocktails has an intergenerational impact. The identified Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) networks for NSAIDs and EE2, at doses that are relevant to everyday human exposure, will improve the AOP network of the human reproductive system development concerning endocrine disruptor chemicals.

This study aims to investigate whether oleocanthal-rich olive oils (OO), incorporated into a carbohydrate-rich meal, can affect postprandial dysmetabolism and platelet aggregation. Oleocanthal is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor with putative antiplatelet properties.

A bi-directional relationship between DILI and MASLD is likely to exist: while certain drugs can cause MASLD by acting as pro-steatogenic factors, MASLD may make hepatocytes more vulnerable to drugs. Having a pre-existing MASLD significantly heightens the likelihood of experiencing DILI from certain medications. Thus, the prevalence of steatosis within DILI may be biased by pre-existing MASLD, and it can be concluded that the genuine true incidence of DIFLD in the general population remains unknown. In certain individuals, drug-induced steatosis is often accompanied by concomitant injury mechanisms such as oxidative stress, cell death, and inflammation, which leads to the development of drug-induced steatohepatitis (DISH). DISH is much more severe from the clinical point of view, has worse prognosis and outcome, and resembles MASH (metabolic-associated steatohepatitis), as it is associated with inflammation and sometimes with fibrosis. A literature review of clinical case reports allowed us to examine and evaluate the clinical features of DIFLD and their association with specific drugs, enabling us to propose a classification of DIFLD drugs based on clinical outcomes and pathological severity: Group 1, drugs with low intrinsic toxicity (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, irinotecan, methotrexate, and tamoxifen), but expected to promote/aggravate steatosis in patients with pre-existing MASLD; Group 2, drugs associated with steatosis and only occasionally with steatohepatitis (e.g., amiodarone, valproic acid, and tetracycline); and Group 3, drugs with a great tendency to transit to steatohepatitis and further to fibrosis. Different mechanisms may be in play when identifying drug mode of action: (1) inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation; (2) inhibition of fatty acid transport across mitochondrial membranes; (3) increased de novo lipid synthesis; (4) reduction in lipid export by the inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; (5) induction of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening; (6) dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential; (7) impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain/oxidative phosphorylation; (8) mitochondrial DNA damage, degradation and depletion; and (9) nuclear receptors (NRs)/transcriptomic alterations. Currently, the majority of, if not all, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for steatosis in AOP-Wiki highlight the interaction with NRs or transcription factors as the key molecular initiating event (MIE). This perspective suggests that chemical-induced steatosis typically results from the interplay between a chemical and a NR or transcription factors, implying that this interaction represents the primary and pivotal MIE. However, upon conducting this exhaustive literature review, it became evident that the current AOPs tend to overly emphasize this interaction as the sole MIE. Some studies indeed support the involvement of NRs in steatosis, but others demonstrate that such NR interactions alone do not necessarily lead to steatosis. This view, ignoring other mitochondrial-related injury mechanisms, falls short in encapsulating the intricate biological mechanisms involved in chemically induced liver steatosis, necessitating their consideration as part of the AOP's map road as well.",2024,,"López-Pascual E, Rienda I, Perez-Rojas J, Rapisarda A, Garcia-Llorens G, Jover R, Castell JV.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25105203,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In addition, RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for MTT assay to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of Ugi-FOlT in the range of 100~500 μg/mL, and the results indicated good cytocompatibility for Ugi-FOlT. Ugi-FOlT micellar aggregates with favorable stability also showed a certain sustained and pH-responsive release behavior for the hydrophobic drug ibuprofen (IBU). Meanwhile, it is feasible to control the drug release rate by regulating the DS of Ugi-FOlT.

GSE158892 dataset data were used to conduct a scRNA-seq analysis. In cell experiments, Schwann cells and macrophages were utilized to examine pain pathogenesis using specific inhibitors. Thirty-two SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham, chronic constriction injury (CCI), ibuprofen, and Paeonol. Behavioral tests combined with ELISA, PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analyses were conducted. CellChat analysis demonstrated that, following peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells secreted IL-34, which interacted with CSF1R on macrophages, leading to the infiltration and activation of macrophages. Paeonol reduced IL-34 production by Schwann cells induced with LPS. Conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated Schwann cells treated with Paeonol did not cause macrophage proliferation or migration, activation of the CSF1 pathway, or ROS production. In CCI rats, Paeonol alleviated mechanical and cold hyperalgesia, while reducing the production of serum inflammatory mediators. Additionally, Paeonol decreased the expression levels of IL-34, CSF1R, phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), phosphorylated NF-κB (p-NF-κB), and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the dorsal root ganglia of CCI rats.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in reducing this pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. However, this mechanism may also interfere with orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) by affecting bone remodeling. This narrative review investigates the existing literature published between 2004 and 2024 to assess the impact of various NSAIDs on OTM and identify those that balance pain relief with minimal impact on tooth movement. Evidence shows that NSAIDs such as aspirin, ketorolac, diclofenac, and nimesulide significantly reduce OTM. The results for ibuprofen, meloxicam, and celecoxib were inconsistent with both no influence or a reduction in OTM, depending on dosage, mode, and duration of administration. Conversely, tenoxicam, nabumetone, etoricoxib, and parecoxib appear to have no effect on OTM. Among these, etoricoxib appears particularly promising due to its favorable gastrointestinal profile, high COX-2 selectivity, and negligible influence on OTM in clinical doses.

Many drugs can cause immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, but the most commonly implicated are abciximab, carbamazepine, ceftriaxone, eptifibatide, heparin, ibuprofen, mirtazapine, oxaliplatin, penicillin, quinine, quinidine, rifampicin, suramin, tirofiban, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Several different mechanisms have been identified in typical DITP, which is most commonly characterized by severe thrombocytopenia due to clearance and/or destruction of platelets sensitized by a drug-dependent antibody. Patients with typical DITP usually bleed when symptomatic, and biological confirmation of the diagnosis is often difficult because detection of drug-dependent antibodies (DDabs) in the patient's serum or plasma is frequently not possible. This is in contrast to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a particular DITP caused in most cases by heparin-dependent antibodies specific for platelet factor 4, which can strongly activate platelets in vitro and in vivo, explaining why affected patients usually have thrombotic complications but do not bleed. In addition, laboratory tests are readily available to diagnose HIT, unlike the methods used to detect DDabs associated with other DITP that are mostly reserved for laboratories specialized in platelet immunology.",2020,,"Vayne C, Guéry EA, Rollin J, Baglo T, Petermann R, Gruel Y.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/7/2212/pdf?version=1594634929,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite its transformative potential, the adoption of PGx in Indian clinical practice faces challenges, such as the lack of population-specific data, evidence-based guidelines, and complexities in interpreting genomic reports. Comprehensive datasets tailored to Indian patients are essential to facilitate the integration of PGx into clinical settings.<h4>Methodology</h4>The study collates pharmacogenomic data from multiple sources, including essential drugs listed by the World Health Organization (WHO), drugs used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), minimum sets of alleles recommended by the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and catalogs the allele frequencies from the IndiGenomes database to address gaps in actionable PGx for the Indian population. Curated datasets were used to identify pharmacogenomic variants relevant to clinical practice.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 24 prime genes are essential for the outcomes of 57 drugs. In adults, 18 genes influence the metabolism of 44 drugs whereas, in pediatric populations, genotypes of 18 genes significantly impact the metabolism of 18 drugs. Two over-the-counter drugs with actionable PGx variants were identified: ibuprofen and omeprazole. These findings emphasize the clinical relevance of PGx for commonly used drugs, underscoring the need for population-specific data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As the data of several Indian human genome projects become available, an overarching need exists to establish and regulate the dynamic actionable PGx in Indian clinical practice.

For some, pain relief is insufficient, while others experience side effects. Although pharmacogenetic testing is rarely performed in the context of analgesics, response to opiates, non-opioid analgesics, and antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain can be affected by genetic variants. We describe a female patient who suffered from a complex chronic pain syndrome due to a disc hernia. Due to insufficient response to oxycodone, fentanyl, and morphine in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced side effects reported in the past, we performed panel-based pharmacogenotyping and compiled a medication recommendation. The ineffectiveness of opiates could be explained by a combined effect of the decreased activity in cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an increased activity in CYP3A, and an impaired drug response at the µ-opioid receptor. Decreased activity for CYP2C9 led to a slowed metabolism of ibuprofen and thus increased the risk for gastrointestinal side effects. Based on these findings we recommended hydromorphone and paracetamol, of which the metabolism was not affected by genetic variants. Our case report illustrates that an in-depth medication review including pharmacogenetic analysis can be helpful for patients with complex pain syndrome.

Wastewater treatment methods are not enough to completely remove active pharmaceuticals and other waste; thus, this study aims to assess the use of a multiwall carbon nanotube after derivatization and magnetization as a new and renewable absorbent for removing ibuprofen from an aqueous medium. The adsorbents were prepared by first oxidizing a multiwall carbon nanotube and then deriving the oxidized product with hydroxyl amine (m-MWCNT-HA), hydrazine (m-MWCNT-HYD), and amino acid (m-MWCNT-CYS). Adsorbents were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Batch adsorption studies were conducted to study the effects of pH, temperature, time, and initial concentration of the adsorbate. Adsorption isotherm, kinetics, and thermodynamics studies were also conducted. The results show that the optimal pH for nearly complete removal of Ibu in a short time at room temperature was 4 for three adsorbents.

The resulting hematite was investigated as adsorbent and photocatalyst for removal of ibuprofen as pharmaceutical waste. Hexagonal flake-like hematite was obtained following calcination at 500 °C with the average size was measured at 1-3 µm. Increasing the calcination temperature to 700 °C transformed the uniform hexagonal structure into cubic shape morphology. Hematite also showed high thermal stability with increasing the calcination temperatures; however, the surface area was reduced from 47 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 9 m<sup>2</sup>/g.

The influence of various operational parameters, including contact time, initial molecule concentration, pH, ionic strength, and temperature, was investigated. The synthesized polymer exhibits an amorphous and porous structure with a remarkable swelling capacity of 9.5 mmol/g. It demonstrates remarkable adsorption capacities for progesterone and ibuprofen, reaching 90% and 75%, respectively. Kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption of both molecules follows a pseudo-second-order model. A DSC analysis elucidated the adsorption mechanism, which is governed by the formation of inclusion complexes and electrostatic interactions within the polymer network. The polymer's regeneration after 23 cycles demonstrates its sustainable adsorption efficiency. The combination of chitosan with three cyclodextrins opens up promising new avenues for water treatment and the removal of specific pollutants. This approach significantly improves the material's selectivity towards target pollutants, offering a significant advantage in pollution remediation applications.",2024,,"Oughlis-Hammache F, Skiba M, Moulahcene L, Milon N, Bounoure F, Lahiani-Skiba M.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17143594,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

TRPA1 channel significantly contributes to the activation of sensory neurons that initiate neurogenic inflammation and mediates pain signal transduction to the central nervous system. Peptide Ms 9a-1 from the sea anemone <i>Metridium senile</i> is a positive allosteric modulator of TRPA1 and shows significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in different models of pain. We used a model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of Ms 9a-1 in comparison with APHC3 (a polypeptide modulator of TRPV1 channel) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as meloxicam and ibuprofen. Administration of Ms 9a-1 (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) significantly reversed joint swelling, disability, thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity, and grip strength impairment. The effect of Ms 9a-1 was equal to or better than that of reference drugs. Post-treatment histological analysis revealed that long-term administration of Ms9a-1 could reduce inflammatory changes in joints and prevent the progression of cartilage and bone destruction at the same level as meloxicam. Peptide Ms 9a-1 showed significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in the model of MIA-induced OA, and therefore positive allosteric modulators could be considered for the alleviation of OA symptoms.",2023,,"Maleeva EE, Palikova YA, Palikov VA, Kazakov VA, Simonova MA, Logashina YA, Tarasova NV, Dyachenko IA, Andreev YA.",https://doi.org/10.3390/md21120617,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The polyelectrolyte chains form a network with nanopores on the ceramic surface and promote the rejection of small molecules such as pharmaceuticals, salts and industrial contaminants, which can otherwise not be eliminated using standard ultrafiltration methods. The properties and performance of newly developed hybrid membranes are in the focus of this investigation. The homogeneity of the applied coating layer was investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Properties such as permeability, bubble point, pore size distribution and Zeta potential were determined for both pristine and LbL coated membranes using various laboratory tests. Subsequently, a thorough comparison was drawn. The charging behavior at solid-liquid interface was characterized using streaming potential techniques.

Due to poor bioavailability (~7%) and marked first-pass effect (~75%), including a short half-life (2-3 h), oral administration of VP is limited. It requires frequent administration of the drug to obtain a therapeutic effect. Attempts to overcome these difficulties include the use of new drug delivery systems and/or alternative routes of drug administration. One possibility is the common administration of lipid emulsion and drug using the same catheter. However, this procedure is not recommended due to potential interaction and lack of safety data. For this purpose, we checked the compatibility of VP solutions with eight commercially available parenteral nutrition admixtures, i.e., Lipoflex special, Omegaflex special, Lipoflex peri, Omegaflex peri, Kabiven, SmofKabiven, Kabiven Peripheral, and Olimel Peri N4E. Coadministration is only possible if the stability of the drug and the lipid emulsion is confirmed. The available data are scarce and only concern the incompatibility of VP with ibuprofen. Compatibility tests were carried out in simulated administration through a Y-site connector using clinical flow rates. The stability of the drug and lipid emulsion was assessed by visual inspection and measurement of pH, osmolality, particle size as mean droplet diameter (MDD) and percentage of lipids residing in globules larger than 5 µm (PFAT5), zeta potential, polydispersity index, and lipid-free parenteral nutrition admixture(PNA) turbidity. The results of the compatibility of VP with eight commercial PN admixtures showed that all lipid emulsions show different signs of destabilization. In the studied samples, particles larger than 1000 nm, a significant increase in MDD, zeta potential, and loss of homogeneity visible as an increase in the polydispersity index were observed. Most of the samples had PFAT5 above the USP limit (0.05%).

Thus, ibuprofen removal potentials and associated bacteria in the hyporheic zone sediments of an impacted river were investigated. Microbially mediated ibuprofen degradation was determined in oxic sediment microcosms amended with ibuprofen (5, 40, 200, and 400 µM), or ibuprofen and acetate, relative to an un-amended control. Ibuprofen was removed by the original sediment microbial community as well as in ibuprofen-enrichments obtained by re-feeding of ibuprofen. Here, 1-, 2-, 3-hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen were the primary transformation products. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher 16S rRNA abundance in ibuprofen-amended relative to un-amended incubations. Time-resolved microbial community dynamics evaluated by 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA analyses revealed many new ibuprofen responsive taxa of the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Latescibacteria, and Proteobacteria.

Recently, we demonstrated that the TpBD-(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> covalent organic framework (COF) can adsorb ibuprofen from ultrapure water with high efficiency. Here, we investigate the performance of the COF for the extraction of ibuprofen from natural water samples from a lake, river, and estuary. In general, the complexity of the natural water matrix induced a reduction in the adsorption efficiency of ibuprofen as compared to ultrapure water. The best performance, with over 70% adsorption efficiency, was found in lake water, the sample which featured the lowest pH. According to the theoretical calculations, ibuprofen more favorably interacts with the COF pores in the protonated form, which could partially account for the enhanced adsorption efficiency found in lake water. In addition, we explored the effect of the presence of competing pharmaceuticals, namely, acetaminophen and phenobarbital, on the ibuprofen adsorption as binary mixtures. Acetaminophen and phenobarbital were adsorbed by TpBD-(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> with low efficiency and their presence led to an increase in ibuprofen adsorption in the binary mixtures. Overall, this study demonstrates that TpBD-(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is an efficient adsorbent for the extraction of ibuprofen from natural waters as well.",2020,,"Fernandes SPS, Mellah A, Kovář P, Sárria MP, Pšenička M, Djamila H, Salonen LM, Espiña B.",https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/14/3132/pdf?version=1594304614,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Conventional wastewater treatment technology does not guarantee effluents of high quality, and apparently clean water may be loaded with pollutants. In this study, we assess the performance and efficiency of free and immobilised cells of microalgae <i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp. in removing four pharmaceuticals, chosen for their occurrence or persistence in the environment. These are paracetamol, ibuprofen, olanzapine and simvastatin. The results showed that free microalgae cells remain alive for a longer time than the immobilised ones, suggesting the inhibition of cell proliferation by the polymeric matrix polyvinyl alcohol. Both cells, free and immobilised, respond differently to each pharmaceutical. The removal of paracetamol and ibuprofen by <i>Nannochloropsis</i> sp., after 24 h of culture, was significantly higher in immobilised cells. Free cells removed a significantly higher concentration of olanzapine than immobilised ones, suggesting a higher affinity to this molecule than to paracetamol and ibuprofen.

Molecular cytotoxicity constitutes a limiting characteristic, especially for cationic and higher-generation dendrimers. Antineoplastic research of dendrimers has been widely developed, and several types of poly(amidoamine) and poly(propylene imine) dendrimer complexes with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, imatinib, sunitinib, cisplatin, melphalan and methotrexate have shown an improvement in comparison with the drug molecule alone. The anti-inflammatory therapy focused on dendrimer complexes of ibuprofen, indomethacin, piroxicam, ketoprofen and diflunisal. In the context of the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, dendrimer complexes of fluoroquinolones, macrolides, beta-lactamines and aminoglycosides have shown promising effects. Regarding antiviral therapy, studies have been performed to develop dendrimer conjugates with tenofovir, maraviroc, zidovudine, oseltamivir and acyclovir, among others. Furthermore, cardiovascular therapy has strongly addressed dendrimers. Employed in imaging diagnostics, dendrimers reduce the dosage required to obtain images, thus improving the efficiency of radioisotopes.

The anti-inflammatory effect of a γ-lactone (5-hexyl-3H-furan-2-one) isolated from ostrich oil and its formulated nano-emulsion in formalin-induced paw edema was investigated in this study. Ostrich oil was saponified using a standard procedure; the aqueous residue was fractionated, purified, and characterized as γ-lactone (5-hexyl-3H-furan-2-one) through the interpretation of IR, NMR, and MS analyses. The γ-lactone was formulated as nano-emulsion using methylcellulose (MC) for oral solubilized form. The γ-lactone methylcellulose nanoparticles (γ-lactone-MC-NPs) were characterized for their size, shape, and encapsulation efficiency with a uniform size of 300 nm and 59.9% drug content. The γ-lactone was applied topically, while the formulated nanoparticles (NPs) were administered orally to rats. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (diclofenac gel) was used as a reference drug for topical use and ibuprofen suspension for oral administration. Edema was measured using the plethysmograph method. Both γ-lactone and γ-lactone-MC-NPs showed reduction of formalin-induced paw edema in rats and proved to be better than the reference drugs; diclofenac gel and ibuprofen emulsion. Histological examination of the skin tissue revealed increased skin thickness with subepidermal edema and mixed inflammatory cellular infiltration, which were significantly reduced by the γ-lactone compared to the positive control (<i>p</i>-value = 0.00013).

Albumin-binding moieties have been used strategically to enhance the tumor uptake and retention of existing PSMA-based investigational agents. Previously, we developed a series of PSMA-based, β-particle-emitting, low-molecular-weight compounds. From this series, <sup>177</sup>Lu-L1 was selected as the lead agent because of its reduced off-target radiotoxicity in preclinical studies. The ligand L1 contains a PSMA-targeting Lys-Glu urea moiety with an N-bromobenzyl substituent in the ε-amino group of Lys. Here, we structurally modified <sup>177</sup>Lu-L1 to improve tumor targeting using two known albumin-binding moieties, 4-(<i>p</i>-iodophenyl) butyric acid moiety (IPBA) and ibuprofen (IBU), and evaluated the effects of linker length and composition. Six structurally related PSMA-targeting ligands (Alb-L1-Alb-L6) were synthesized based on the structure of <sup>177</sup>Lu-L1. The ligands were assessed for in vitro binding affinity and were radiolabeled with <sup>177</sup>Lu following standard protocols. All <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled analogs were studied in cell uptake and selected cell efficacy studies. In vivo pharmacokinetics were investigated by conducting tissue biodistribution studies for <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2-<sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 (2 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 192 h) in male NSG mice bearing human PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA- PC3 flu xenografts. Preliminary therapeutic ratios of the agents were estimated from the area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-192h</sub>) of the tumors, blood, and kidney uptake values. Compounds were obtained in >98% radiochemical yields and >99% purity. PSMA inhibition constants (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>s) of the ligands were in the ≤10 nM range. The long-linker-based agents, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L5, displayed significantly higher tumor uptake and retention (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than the short-linker-bearing <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L3 and a long polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker-bearing agent, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6. The area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-192h</sub>) of the PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumor uptake of <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L5 were >4-fold higher than <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L3, and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6, respectively. Also, the PSMA+ PIP tumor uptake (AUC<sub>0-192h</sub>) of <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L3 was ~1.5-fold higher than <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6. However, the lowest blood AUC<sub>0-192h</sub> and kidney AUC<sub>0-192h</sub> were associated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 from the series. Consequently, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 displayed the highest ratios of AUC(tumor)-to-AUC(blood) and AUC(tumor)-to-AUC(kidney) values from the series. Among the other agents, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 demonstrated a nearly similar ratio of AUC(tumor)-to-AUC(blood) as <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6. The tumor-to-blood ratio was the dose-limiting therapeutic ratio for all of the compounds. Conclusions: <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 showed high tumor uptake in PSMA+ tumors and tumor-to-blood ratios. The data suggest that linker length and composition can be modulated to generate an optimized therapeutic agent.",2023,,"Boinapally S, Alati S, Jiang Z, Yan Y, Lisok A, Singh R, Lofland G, Minn I, Hobbs RF, Pomper MG, Banerjee SR.",https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28166158,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study aimed to isolate and identify the chemicals with antipyretic bioactivity in <i>T. hemsleyanum</i> extracts and to provide an explanation for the use of <i>T. hemsleyanum</i> as a Chinese herbal medicine for fever treatment. Our results demonstrate that kaempferol 3-rutinoside (K3OR) could be successfully isolated and purified from the roots of <i>T. hemsleyanum</i>. Furthermore, K3OR exhibited a significant reduction in rectal temperature in a mouse model of fever. Notably, a 4 μM concentration of K3OR showed more effective antipyretic effects than ibuprofen and acetaminophen. To explore the underlying mechanism, we conducted an RNA sequencing analysis, which revealed that PXN may act as a key regulator in the fever process induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the mouse model of fever, K3OR significantly promoted the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α during the early stage in the LPS-treated group. However, during the middle to late stages, K3OR facilitated the elimination of IL-6 and TNF-α in the LPS-treated group. Overall, our study successfully identified the chemicals responsible for the antipyretic bioactivity in <i>T. hemsleyanum</i> extracts, and it answered the question as to why <i>T. hemsleyanum</i> is used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treating fever.

Mechanical milling as well as mechanical milling combined with thermal annealing of the powder mixtures were applied as synthetic methods. Solubility and dissolution kinetics of the complexes were studied in compliance with European Pharmacopoeia (ICH Q4B). β-CD and citric acid (CA) molecules were shown to interact by both ball milling (BM), thermal annealing, as well as BM with subsequent annealing. Complexes were also formed by milling the three compounds (β-CD, CA and IBU) simultaneously, as well as by a consecutive first including IBU into β-CD and then binding the formed β-CD/IBU inclusion complex with CA. As a result, ternary β-CD/IBU/CA complex formed by initial incorporation of ibuprofen into β-CD, followed by successive formation of a two-phase mixture with CA, exhibited notably improved dissolution kinetics compared to the pure ibuprofen and slightly better compared to the binary β-CD/IBU system.

These compounds are indicated with the term emerging contaminants (or Contaminants of Emerging Concern, CECs) since they are potentially dangerous for the environment and human health. To date, among the most widely used methodologies for the removal of CECs from the aquatic environment, adsorption processes play a role of primary importance, as they have proven to be characterized by high removal efficiency, low operating and management costs, and an absence of undesirable by-products. In this paper, the adsorption of ibuprofen (IBU), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used for treating inflammation or pain, was performed for the first time using two different types of geopolymer-based materials, i.e., a metakaolin-based (GMK) and an organic-inorganic hybrid (GMK-S) geopolymer. The proposed adsorbing matrices are characterized by a low environmental footprint and have been easily obtained as powders or as highly porous filters by direct foaming operated directly into the adsorption column.

EVOO is a rich source of bioactive compounds including fatty acids and phenolics; however, the biological activities of only a small subset of compounds associated with <i>Olea europaea</i> have been explored. Here, the OliveNet<sup>TM</sup> library (consisting of over 600 compounds) was utilized to investigate olive-derived compounds as potential modulators of the arachidonic acid pathway. Our first aim was to perform enzymatic assays to evaluate the inhibitory activity of a selection of phenolic compounds and fatty acids against COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) and 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX). Olive compounds were found to inhibit COX isoforms, with minimal activity against 15-LOX. Subsequent molecular docking indicated that the olive compounds possess strong binding affinities for the active site of COX isoforms, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the stability of binding. Moreover, olive compounds were predicted to have favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including a readiness to cross biological membranes as highlighted by steered MD simulations and umbrella sampling. Importantly, olive compounds including OLC were identified as non-inhibitors of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel based on patch clamp assays.

An ambient temperature upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was employed, followed by a two-stage (saturated and unsaturated) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) constructed wetland (CW) system, to treat domestic wastewater from a nearby settlement and investigate the occurrence and fate of 10 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in decentralized, non-conventional treatment systems. The integrated UASB-two-stage CW system achieved high performance regarding abatement of target CECs across all periods. Removal efficiencies ranged from 78% ± 21% (ketoprofen) to practically 100% (2-hydroxybenzothiazole). The pilot system was found to be robust performance-wise and provided enhanced treatment in comparison to a conventional wastewater treatment plant operating in parallel. Most of the target CECs were successfully treated by UASB, saturated and unsaturated CWs, while ibuprofen, bisphenol A and diclofenac were mostly removed in the unsaturated CW.

Due to the vasodilatation caused by nitrogen monoxide, NO-donors have been shown to protect endothelial function, acting as vasodilators, promoting efficient oxygen supply to tissues, to lower blood pressure, and to inhibit platelet aggregation. Incorporation of a NO-liberating moiety in the structure of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in anti-inflammatory agents that are safer for the gastrointestinal system. In this research, ibuprofen and naproxen, two commonly applied non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), non-selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenases, were used to design novel anti-inflammatory agents able to release NO in the organism. Thus, the NSAIDs were amidated with beta-alanine and L-proline, which were able to incorporate the 2-nitro-oxyethyl moiety as the NO donor. The resulting compounds were anti-inflammatory agents, found to be more potent than the mother drugs, demonstrating remarkable inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 and the ability to release NO in vitro. Furthermore, two of the most active anti-inflammatory compounds proved to be effective hypolipidemic agents, decreasing plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol in hyperlipidemic rats significantly. The most effective compound in all the above tests was the ibuprofen derivative 5, which inhibited COX-2 by 95%, decreased inflammation by 73%, and reduced all lipidemic indices by more than 50%. Furthermore, docking experiments of compound 5 on the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 showed that it interacts intensely with the binding site of COX-2, and the binding energy is equivalent to that of the relevant to celecoxib selective COX-2 inhibitor 4-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide (SC-5580). In conclusion, the performed structural modifications resulted not only in the improvement of the anti-inflammatory activity, compared with the parent NSAID, but also acquired strong hypolipidemic activity.

Driven by this need, this study reports, for the first time, the removal of pharmaceuticals from real contaminated water samples using porous graphene (PG) as a filter-based column. This work systematically evaluates the performance of PG as a filter medium for the removal of widely consumed pharmaceutical/emerging contaminants (ECs) such as atenolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. Several factors were investigated in these column studies, including different reactive layer configurations, bed packing heights (5-45 mm), filter sizes (inner diameter 18-40 mm), adsorbent dosages (100-500 mg-PG) and water bodies (distilled water, greywater, and actual effluent wastewater). Sustainable synthesis of PG was carried out followed by its use as a filter medium for the removal of pharmaceuticals at high concentrations (10.5 ± 0.5 mg/L) and trace concentrations (1 mg/L). These findings revealed that the double-layered PG-sand column outperformed a PG single-layered configuration for the removal of most of the ECs. The removal efficiency of ECs from their solutions was improved by increasing PG dosages and filter bed height and size. Although the treatment of mixed pharmaceutical solutions from different water bodies was affected by the negative interference caused by competing water compounds, the treatment of ECs-contaminated greywater was not severely affected.

Acid-chars were prepared from two biomass precursors (sisal and glucose) using various H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> concentrations (13.5 M, 12 M, and 9 M) and further steam-activated at increasing burn-off degrees. Selected materials were tested for the removal of ibuprofen and iopamidol from aqueous solution (kinetic and equilibrium assays) in single-solute conditions. Activated carbons prepared from acid-char carbonized with 13.5 M and 12 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are mainly microporous solids composed of compact rough particles, yielding a maximum surface area and a total pore volume of 1987 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.96 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

The transferred ozone dose (TOD) ranged from 0 to 150 μM, and nanoparticles were added in concentrations between 0 and 1.5 g L<sup>-1</sup>, with all experiments conducted at 20 °C and a total volume of 240 mL. A Ce-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst (1% molar ratio of Ce/Ti) was synthesized via the sol-gel method. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to identify the most significant factors affecting the removal of selected pharmaceuticals, with TOD emerging as the most critical variable. Higher TOD resulted in greater removal efficiencies. Furthermore, it was found that the commercially available metal oxides α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and CeO<sub>2</sub>, as well as the synthesized CeTiO<sub>x</sub>, did not increase the catalytic activity of ozone during the degradation of ibuprofen (IBF) and para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA). Carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF) are compounds susceptible to ozone oxidation, thus their complete degradation at 150 μM transferred ozone dose was attained. The limited catalytic effect was attributed to the rapid consumption of ozone within the first minute of reaction, as well as the saturation of catalyst active sites by water molecules, which inhibited effective ozone adsorption and subsequent hydroxyl radical generation (<sup>●</sup>OH).",2024,,"Tsiarta N, Gernjak W, Cajner H, Matijašić G, Ćurković L.",https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14211747,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Nucleotide mutations of the RNA polymerase 3 subunit b (polr3b) gene are responsible for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 8 (HLD8), which is an autosomal recessive oligodendroglial cell disease. Despite the important association between POLR3B mutation and HLD8, it remains unclear how mutated POLR3B proteins cause oligodendroglial cell abnormalities. Herein, we show that a severe HLD8-associated nonsense mutation (Arg550-to-Ter (R550X)) primarily localizes POLR3B proteins as protein aggregates into lysosomes in the FBD-102b cell line as an oligodendroglial precursor cell model. Conversely, wild type POLR3B proteins were not localized in lysosomes. Additionally, the expression of proteins with the R550X mutation in cells decreased lysosome-related signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Cells harboring the mutant constructs did not exhibit oligodendroglial cell differentiated phenotypes, which have widespread membranes that extend from their cell body. However, cells harboring the wild type constructs exhibited differentiated phenotypes. Ibuprofen, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), improved the defects in their differentiation phenotypes and signaling through mTOR. These results indicate that the HLD8-associated POLR3B proteins with the R550X mutation are localized in lysosomes, decrease mTOR signaling, and inhibit oligodendroglial cell morphological differentiation, and ibuprofen improves these cellular pathological effects. These findings may reveal some of the molecular and cellular pathological mechanisms underlying HLD8 and their amelioration.",2022,,"Sawaguchi S, Suzuki R, Oizumi H, Ohbuchi K, Mizoguchi K, Yamamoto M, Miyamoto Y, Yamauchi J.",https://www.mdpi.com/2035-8377/14/1/18/pdf?version=1648104487,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Currently available AD treatments only exhibit symptomatic relief but do not generally intervene with the amyloid and tau pathologies. The extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) monophenolic secoiridoid <i>S</i>-(-)-oleocanthal (OC) showed anti-inflammatory activity through COX system inhibition with potency comparable to the standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen. OC also showed positive in vitro, in vivo, and clinical therapeutic effects against cardiovascular diseases, many malignancies, and AD. Due to its pungent, astringent, and irritant taste, OC should be formulated in acceptable dosage form before its oral use as a potential nutraceutical. The objective of this study is to develop new OC oral formulations, assess whether they maintained OC activity on the attenuation of β-amyloid pathology in a 5xFAD mouse model upon 4-month oral dosing use. Exploration of potential OC formulations underlying molecular mechanism is also within this study scope. OC powder formulation (OC-PF) and OC-solid dispersion formulation with erythritol (OC-SD) were prepared and characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy (ScEM) analyses. Both formulations showed an improved OC dissolution profile. OC-PF and OC-SD improved memory deficits of 5xFAD mice in behavioral studies. OC-PF and OC-SD exhibited significant attenuation of the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau phosphorylation in the brain of 5xFAD female mice. Both formulations markedly suppressed C3AR1 (complement component 3a receptor 1) activity by targeting the downstream marker STAT3.

Furthermore, this study examined the need for Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) by comparing their effects with a placebo group. This study enrolled 42 individuals requiring the extraction of a single mandibular third molar under local anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned to receive Brome-Inf<sup>®</sup>, purified bromelain, or a placebo orally, initiating treatment on the day of surgery and continuing for the next 7 days. The primary outcome measured was the requirement for NSAIDs in the three groups. Pain, swelling, and trismus were secondary outcome variables, evaluated postoperatively at 1, 3, and 7 days. This study also assessed the comparative efficacy of freeze-dried pineapple extract and single-component bromelain. Ultimately, the placebo group showed a statistically higher need for ibuprofen (from days 1 to 7) at the study's conclusion (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In addition, reductions in pain and swelling were significantly higher in both the bromelain and pineapple groups (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 for almost all patients, at all intervals) than in the placebo group. The active groups also demonstrated a significant difference in QoL compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). A non-significant reduction in trismus occurred in the treatment groups compared to the placebo group. Therefore, the administration of pineapple extract titrated in bromelain showed significant analgesic and anti-edema effects in addition to improving QoL in the postoperative period for patients who had undergone mandibular third molar surgery. Moreover, both bromelain and Brome-Inf<sup>®</sup> supplementation reduced the need for ibuprofen to comparable extents, proving that they are good alternatives to NSAIDs in making the postoperative course more comfortable for these patients.

Their pain intensity was then assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Moreover, salivary α-amylase (AA) activity, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and transforming growth factor beta2 (TGF-β<sub>2</sub>) concentrations were measured. Levels of VAS and AA decreased 7 days after the first and second molar extractions in the two treatment groups.<h4>Results</h4>The kale extract was more effective than ibuprofen. MMP-9 and TGF-β<sub>2</sub> levels were reduced on days 4 and 7 following the two extractions in the kale group, whereas they were reduced on days 4 and 7 following the first extraction in the ibuprofen group. There was a positive correlation between MMP-9 and TGF-β<sub>2</sub>.

Gagam-Sipjeondaebo-Tang (GST), a traditional herbal formula made of twelve medicinal herbs, is known to be effective in PD, and the use of ibuprofen has been associated with a lower risk of PD. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the combined administration of GST and ibuprofen affects the inflammatory response of Parkinson's disease. MPTP-induced parkinsonian mouse models were treated with GST or ibuprofen using oral gavage once a day for 5 days. The effects of GST were examined by measuring the TH level and expression of CD68 in the mice brain in addition to behavioral tests. The anti-inflammatory effect of GST on the LPS-treated RAW264.7 murine macrophages was examined using the NO assay. Inflammatory cytokines were analyzed using quantitative-PCR and flow cytometry. In the results, GST significantly improved the loss of dopaminergic neurons and alleviated PD-induced behavioral deficits. GST also decreased macrophage activation in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model. Interestingly, co-administration of GST and ibuprofen showed a synergistic effect in improving the loss of dopaminergic neurons and decreasing the activation of macrophages. Moreover, the NO level decreased in LPS-stimulated macrophages with this combined treatment. GST reduced iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, and co-administration with ibuprofen showed a synergistic effect. Furthermore, pretreatment of GST reduced the expression levels of MCP-1 and IL-12 p70 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.

In this study, we explore the potential of the molecular consortia of cannabidiol (CBD) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as novel antiviral dual-target agents against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. CBD is a natural compound with a wide range of therapeutic activities, including antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, while NSAIDs are commonly used to mitigate the symptoms of viral infections. Chemical modifications of CBD with NSAIDs were performed to obtain dual-target agents with enhanced activity against SARS-CoV-2. The synthesised compounds were characterised using spectroscopic techniques. The biological activity of three molecular consortia (CBD-ibuprofen, CBD-ketoprofen, and CBD-naproxen) was evaluated in cell lines transduced with vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes bearing the SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins or infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34. The results showed that some CBD-NSAID molecular consortia have superior antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, but not against the influenza A virus. This may suggest a potential therapeutic role for these compounds in the treatment of emerging coronavirus infections. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of these compounds in vivo, and their potential use in clinical settings.

However, few studies have been explored to provide evidence of the possible synergism between a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a cannabinoid agonist, in order to establish which combinations might be effective to manage pain. The aim of this study was to explore the synergism between ibuprofen (IBU) and the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) to improve pain relief by analyzing the degree of participation of the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> cannabinoid receptors in the possible antinociceptive synergism using an experimental model of pain in Wistar rats.

Despite the satisfactory results achieved by oral analgesics, parenteral analgesia remains a key tool in the treatment of painful conditions when the enteral routes of administration are inconvenient. Parenteral ready-to-use fixed-dose combinations of non-opioid analgesics combinations, including NSAIDs and paracetamol or metamizole, could play a central role in the treatment of painful conditions by combining the advantages of multimodal and parenteral analgesia in a single formulation.

These compounds belong to N-hydroxyurea and hydroxamic acid derivatives and analogs of NSAIDs indomethacin, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen (compounds <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>11,</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively) with dual COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitory activity. Two in vitro methods (biopartitioning micellar chromatography (BMC) and PAMPA) were used to evaluate passive gastrointestinal absorption, while high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were used to evaluate binding to human serum albumin (HSA). The introduction of N-hydroxyurea and hydroxamic acid groups into the structure of NSAIDs decreases both expected passive gastrointestinal absorption (BMC <b>k</b> values were from 3.02 to 9.50, while for NSAIDs were from 5.29 to 13.36; PAMPA <b>-logPe</b> values were between 3.81 and 4.76, while for NSAIDs were ≤3.46) and HSA binding (HPAC <b>logk</b> values were from 2.03 to 9.54, while for NSAIDs were ≥11.03; DPV peak potential shifts were between 7 and 34, while for NSAIDs were ≥54). Structural modifications of all tested compounds that increase lipophilicity could be considered to enhance their passive gastrointestinal absorption. Considering lower expected HSA binding and higher lipophilicity of tested compounds compared to corresponding NSAIDs, it can be expected that the volume of distribution of compounds <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>11,</b> and <b>12</b> will be higher. Reduced HSA binding may also decrease interactions with other drugs in comparison to corresponding NSAIDs. All tested compounds showed significant microsomal instability (25.07-58.44% decrease in concentration) in comparison to indomethacin (14.47%) and diclofenac (20.99%).",2024,,"Bošković J, Dobričić V, Savić J, Rupar J, Aleksić M, Marković B, Čudina O.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101329,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To better understand the recognition mechanisms, molecular docking studies were conducted. <b>Methods:</b> Binding affinity was assessed through zonal elution approach Additionally, displacement chromatography with site-specific probes provided insights into the HSA binding sites of five synthetic cannabinoids. <b>Results:</b> That these drugs exhibit extensive binding to HSA, with values ranging from 98.7% to 99.9%. Competition for site I was observed between warfarin and four synthetic cannabinoids (5F-AMB, AB-PINACA, AMB-FUBINACA, and AB-CHMINACA). Furthermore, AB-CHMINACA also competed with L-tryptophan for site II. The binding affinity of all synthetic cannabinoids increased in the presence of (<i>S</i>)-ibuprofen. Molecular docking studies supported the experimental findings, reinforcing the insights gained. <b>Conclusions:</b> The key novelty of this study lies in analyzing, for the first time, the binding affinity of synthetic cannabinoids to HSA through HPAC and molecular docking. These results may improve our understanding of their toxicokinetic behavior and help in predicting possible competitive interactions that could influence HSA binding and, consequently, their activity and toxicity.

To study this high heterogeneity in the inhibitory effects of NSAIDs, we have developed an in silico approach to evaluate NSAID action on targets under different PGHS-1 microenvironmental conditions, such as arachidonic acid, reducing cofactor, and peroxide concentrations. The designed technique permits translating the drug IC<sub>50</sub>, obtained in one experimental setting to another, and predicts in vivo inhibitory effects based on the relevant in vitro data. For the aspirin case, we elucidated the mechanism underlying the enhancement and reduction (aspirin resistance) of its efficacy, depending on PGHS-1 microenvironment in in vitro/in vivo experimental settings. We also present the results of the in silico screening of the combined action of sets of two NSAIDs (aspirin with ibuprofen, aspirin with celecoxib), and study the mechanism of the experimentally observed effect of the suppression of aspirin-mediated PGHS-1 inhibition by selective and nonselective NSAIDs.

NSAIDs encounter several obstacles to passing across biological membranes. To overcome these constraints, we decided to study the effects of a new pH-sensitive formulation of niosomes containing Polysorbate 20 derivatized by Glycine and loaded with ibuprofen (NioIbu) in several animal models of pain in mice. We performed two tests commonly used to study acute antinociceptive activity, namely the writhing test and the capsaicin test. Our results demonstrated that NioIbu, administered 2 h before testing, reduced nociception, whereas the free form of ibuprofen was ineffective. In a model of inflammatory pain, hyperalgesia induced by zymosan, NioIbu induced a long-lasting reduction in hyperalgesia in treated mice. In a model of neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve chronic constriction, NioIbu reduced both neuropathy-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia. The results obtained in our experiments suggest that pH-sensitive niosomes containing Polysorbate 20 derivatized by Glycine is an effective model for NSAIDs delivery, providing durable antinociceptive effects and reducing the incidence of side effects.",2019,,"Marzoli F, Marianecci C, Rinaldi F, Passeri D, Rossi M, Minosi P, Carafa M, Pieretti S.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics11020062,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Solid-state characterization of the dispersions was conducted by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PXRD and DSC results suggested that the amorphous form of IBU was maintained in the solid dispersions. Furthermore, in vitro dissolution and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in rats were also performed. The dissolution performance of the SCF-prepared IBU dispersions was significantly improved compared to that of the physical mixtures of crystalline IBU and a polymer. In addition, the PK results revealed that the SCF-prepared IBU dispersions produced remarkably high blood drug concentrations (both the AUC and C<sub>max</sub>) and a rapid absorption rate (T<sub>max</sub>). Finally, molecular modeling was used to evaluate the binding energy of interactions between IBU and the polymers. The negative binding energy suggests a relatively stable system.

A mesoporous nanostructured ZnO (mesoNsZnO) carrier with 8-nm pores, spherical-nanoparticle morphology, and an SSA of 75 m<sup>2</sup>/g has been synthesized and, for the first time, subjected to SSI with poorly water-soluble drugs. Ibuprofen (IBU), clotrimazole (CTZ), and hydrocortisone (HC) were selected as highly, moderately, and poorly CO<sub>2</sub>-soluble drugs. Powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption analysis, and ethanol extraction coupled with ultraviolet spectroscopy were employed to characterize the samples and quantify drug loading. Successful results were obtained with IBU and CTZ while HC loading was negligible, which could be related to different solubilities in CO<sub>2</sub>, drug size, and polarity. Successful SSI resulted in amorphous multilayer confinement of the drug. The mesoNsZnO-IBU system showed double drug loading than the mesoNsZnO-CTZ one, with a maximum uptake of 0.24 g/g. Variation of contact time during SSI of the mesoNsZnO-IBU system showed that drug loading triplicated between 3 and 8 h with an additional 30% increment between 8 h and 24 h.

Fully relying on these models as a surrogate tool requires continuous optimization and validation. To do so, intraluminal and systemic data are desirable to judge the predicted outcomes. The aim of this study was to predict the systemic concentrations of ibuprofen after oral administration of an 800 mg immediate-release (IR) tablet to healthy subjects in fasted-state conditions. A mechanistic oral absorption model coupled with a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) model was built in Phoenix WinNonlinWinNonlin<sup>®</sup> software and in the GastroPlus™ simulator. It should be noted that all simulations were performed in an ideal framework as we were in possession of a plethora of in vivo data (e.g., motility, pH, luminal and systemic concentrations) in order to evaluate and optimize these models. All this work refers to the fact that important, yet crucial, gastrointestinal (GI) variables should be integrated into biopredictive dissolution testing (low buffer capacity media, considering phosphate versus bicarbonate buffer, hydrodynamics) to account for a valuable input for physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) platform programs. While simulations can be performed and mechanistic insights can be gained from such simulations from current software, we need to move from correlations to predictions (IVIVC → IVIVP) and, moreover, we need to further determine the dynamics of the GI variables controlling the dosage form transit, disintegration, dissolution, absorption and metabolism along the human GI tract. Establishing the link between biopredictive in vitro dissolution testing and mechanistic oral absorption modeling (i.e., physiologically-based biopharmaceutics modeling (PBBM)) creates an opportunity to potentially request biowaivers in the near future for orally administered drug products, regardless of its classification according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS).",2020,,"Bermejo M, Hens B, Dickens J, Mudie D, Paixão P, Tsume Y, Shedden K, Amidon GL.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12010074,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Herewith, the vaginal-PVPA (Phospholipid Vesicle-based Permeation Assay) in vitro permeability model was validated as a tool to evaluate the permeation of the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen from liposomal formulations (i.e., plain and chitosan-coated liposomes). Drug permeation was assessed in the presence and absence of mucus and simulated vaginal fluid (SVF) at pH conditions mimicking both the healthy vaginal premenopausal conditions and vaginal infection/pre-puberty/post-menopause state. The permeation of ibuprofen proved to depend on the type of formulation (i.e., chitosan-coated liposomes exhibited lower drug permeation), the mucoadhesive formulation properties and pH condition.

However, the application of mechanically and thermally intensive processes is not straightforward in the cases of ductile and/or low melting point substances that may additionally be susceptible to eutectic formation. Using ibuprofen (IBU) as a model drug with non-favorable mechanical and melting properties, we attempt to rationalize nanocrystal formulation and manufacturing in an integrated approach by implementing Quality by Design (QbD) methodology, particle informatics techniques and computationally assisted process design. Wet media milling was performed in the presence of different stabilizers and co-milling agents, and the nanosuspensions were solidified by spray-drying. The effects of key process parameters (bead diameter, milling time and rotational speed) and formulation variables (stabilizer type and drug/stabilizer ratio) on the critical quality attributes (CQAs), i.e., Z-average size, polydispersity index (PDI), ζ-potential and redispersibility of spray-dried nanosuspensions were evaluated, while possible correlations between IBU free surface energy and stabilizer effectiveness were studied. The fracture mechanism and surface stabilization of IBU were investigated by computer simulation of the molecular interactions at the crystal lattice level.

Here, a biomimetic artificial membrane permeability assay (Franz-PAMPA Pampa) was validated using a Franz cells apparatus. Both high and low permeability drugs (metoprolol and mannitol, respectively) were used as external standards. Biomimetic properties of Franz-PAMPA were also characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Moreover, the permeation profile for eight Biopharmaceutic Classification System (BCS) model drugs cited in the FDA guidance and another six drugs (acyclovir, cimetidine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam, and trimethoprim) were measured across Franz-PAMPA.

The main objective of this work is to assess if results from permeation, most of them at finite dose, may be equivalent to those from penetration usually at infinite dose. The transdermal behavior of four drugs with different physicochemical properties (diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, lidocaine, and caffeine) was studied using penetration/finite and kinetic permeation/infinite dose systems using vertical Franz diffusion cells to determine the relationships between permeation and penetration profiles. Good correlation of these two in vitro assays is difficult to find; the influence of their dosage and the proportion of different ionized/unionized compounds due to the pH of the skin layers was demonstrated. Finite and infinite dose regimens have different applications in transdermal delivery. Each approach presents its own advantages and challenges. Pharmaceutical industries are not always clear about the method and the dose to use to determine transdermal drug delivery. Being aware that this study presents results for four actives with different physicochemical properties, it can be concluded that the permeation/infinite results could not be always extrapolated to those of penetration/finite.

However, to date, the role of excipients in these formulations on skin delivery of actives has received little attention from scientists in the field. Monitoring skin absorption of both drug and vehicle may provide insights into the mechanism by which excipients promote permeation and may facilitate the design of effective and safer products. Previously, we have investigated the use of quantitative Confocal Raman Spectroscopy (CRS) to investigate the delivery of an active to the skin, and we also reported the first fully quantitative study that compared this method with the well-established in vitro permeation test (IVPT) model. To further explore the potential of quantitative CRS in assessing topical delivery, the present work investigated the effects of commonly used excipients on the percutaneous absorption of a model drug, ibuprofen (IBU). Permeation of IBU and selected solvents following finite dose applications to human skin was determined in vitro and in vivo by Franz diffusion studies and quantitative CRS, respectively. The solvents used were propylene glycol (PG), dipropylene glycol (DPG), tripropylene glycol (TPG), and polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300). Overall, the cumulative amounts of IBU that permeated at 24 h in vitro were similar for PG, DPG, and TPG (<i>p</i> > 0.05). These three vehicles outperformed PEG 300 (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in terms of drug delivery. Concerning the vehicles, the rank order for in vitro skin permeation was DPG ≥ PG > TPG, while PEG 300 did not permeate the skin. A linear relationship between maximum vehicle and IBU flux in vitro was found, with a correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.95. When comparing in vitro with in vivo data, a positive in vitro-in vivo (IVIV) correlation between the cumulative permeation of IBU in vitro and the total amount of IBU that penetrated the stratum corneum (SC) in vivo was observed, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.90. A strong IVIV correlation, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82, was found following the linear regression of the cumulative number of solvents permeated in vitro and the corresponding skin uptake in vivo measured with CRS. This is the first study to correlate in vivo permeation of solvents measured by CRS with data obtained by in vitro diffusion studies. The IVIV correlations suggest that CRS is a powerful tool for profiling drug and vehicle delivery from dermal formulations. Future studies will examine additional excipients with varying physicochemical properties. Ultimately, these findings are expected to lead to new approaches for the design, evaluation, and optimization of formulations that target actives to and through the skin.",2021,,"Patel A, Iliopoulos F, Caspers PJ, Puppels GJ, Lane ME.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/4/542/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Carriers with varying pore sizes (0.027-0.125 mm) were constructed and loaded with Ibuprofen to yield drug-loaded carriers with a total amount of 0.83-2.67 mg API (0.32-1.41% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>). Dissolution studies of the carriers show a significantly decreasing dissolution rate with decreasing pore sizes with a mean dissolution time (MDT) of 8.7 min for the largest pore size and 128.2 min for the smallest pore size. The API dissolution mechanism from the carriers was determined to be Fickian diffusion from the non-soluble, non-swelling carriers. Using 3D printing in combination with the CPD process, we were able to develop dosage forms with individually tailored controlled drug release. The dissolution rate of our dosage forms can be easily adjusted to the individual needs by modifying the pore sizes of the 3D printed carriers.",2021,,"Schmid J, Wahl MA, Daniels R.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13040543,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To enhance the solubility of ibuprofen (IBU), a poorly water-soluble drug, we attempted to adsorb IBU onto spherical porous calcium silicate (Florite<sup>®</sup> PS300, PS300) in two ways: the evaporation (EV) and sealed heating (SH) methods. The crystallinity of the samples was evaluated using powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular interaction between IBU and PS300 was evaluated with FTIR. In addition, the dissolution behavior of IBU in the samples was assessed by the dissolution test. Based on the results of the PXRD and DSC measurements, both methods allowed adsorption of IBU onto PS300, and IBU was amorphized. Based on the FTIR observations, in the SH or EV mixtures containing 10% and 30% IBU, respectively, it seemed that the IBU molecules intermolecularly interacted with calcium molecules as the main component of PS300. Improvement in the solubility of IBU was observed with both methods; however, the dissolution rate of IBU from samples prepared via SH was higher than that from EV, or of IBU crystals. Collectively, our findings indicate that the petal-like structure of PS300, which has a spherical shape and good flowability, is an effective tool for adsorbing IBU onto PS300 via SH.",2021,,"Kawano Y, Chen S, Hanawa T.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/6/767/pdf?version=1621732440,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, the sustained drug release achieved in prior studies largely relies on the presence of hydrophilic excipients in the printing formulation, which unfortunately impedes the printability and formability of the corresponding printing formulations. The current study developed and prepared mini-sized oral pellets using the SLA technique and successfully accomplished a hydrophilic excipient-independent drug release behavior. With ibuprofen as the model drug, the customized photopolymerizable printing formulation included polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) as a monomer and diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO) as a photoinitiator. The produced mini-sized pellets were thoroughly investigated for various factors, including their printability, physical properties, microscopic features, drug content, and drug-release profiles. The drug release profiles from the printed pellets that were larger size (3 mm and 6 mm) followed the Ritger-Peppas model, demonstrating that the release was influenced by both the diffusion of the dissolved drug and by the erosion of the hydrophilic excipients (PEG400). The profiles from the smaller printed pellets (1 mm and 2 mm) followed first release kinetics, not only illustrating that the release was impacted only by drug diffusion, but also indicating that there is a size boundary between the dependent and independent hydrophilic excipients. These results could create practical benefits to the pharmaceutical industry in terms of the design and development personalized dosages using the SLA printing technique with controllable drug release by manipulating size alone.",2021,,"Xu L, Yang Q, Qiang W, Li H, Zhong W, Pan S, Yang G.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/10/1717/pdf?version=1634791023,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, most of these drugs display low water solubility, which makes their incorporation into hydrophilic biopolymeric drug-delivery systems difficult. To overcome this drawback, aqueous solutions of bio-based deep eutectic solvents (DES) were investigated to enhance the solubility of ibuprofen, a widely used NSAID, leading to an increase in its solubility of up to 7917-fold when compared to its water solubility. These DES solutions were shown to be non-toxic to macrophages with cell viabilities of 97.4% (at ibuprofen concentrations of 0.25 mM), while preserving the anti-inflammatory action of the drug. Their incorporation into alginate-based hydrogels resulted in materials with a regular structure and higher flexibility. These hydrogels present a sustained release of the drug, which is able, when containing the DES aqueous solution comprising ibuprofen, to deliver 93.5% of the drug after 8 h in PBS. Furthermore, these hydrogels were able to improve the drug permeation across human skin by 8.5-fold in comparison with the hydrogel counterpart containing only ibuprofen.

Typically, these parameters are evaluated using a variety of techniques. Nonetheless, there has been no previous research on versatile tool development for evaluating several tablet characteristics with a single tool. The aim of this study was to develop the versatile tool for measuring various physical properties of eutectic effervescent tablets and also investigate the relationship between these parameters with parameters from drug dissolution. Ibuprofen (IBU)-poloxamer 407 (P407) eutectic effervescent tablets were fabricated with a direct compression method. Their wetting properties, gel formation and erosion behaviors were investigated using a stereomicroscope with imaging analysis in terms of the liquid penetration distance, gel thickness and erosion boundary diameter, respectively. In addition, the dissolution rate (k) and disintegration time of eutectic effervescent tablets in 0.1 N HCl buffer pH 1.2 were also determined. Incorporation of P407 into the IBU tablet improved the tablet wetting properties with increasing liquid penetration distance under stereoscope. CO<sub>2</sub> liberation from effervescent agents promoted tablet surface roughness from matrix erosion. The relationship between observed physical properties and disintegration and dissolution parameters suggested that the combination of erosion by effervescent agents and gel formation by P407 had a potential influence on dissolution enhancement of the formulation.

This includes balancing the benefits and risks not only of single drugs but often requires complex between-drug comparisons. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been available for several decades and their use is described in an abundance of guidelines. Most of these guidelines recommend that 'the selection of a particular NSAID should be based on the benefit-risk balance for each patient'. However, head-to-head studies are often lacking or of poor quality, reflecting the lower standards for clinical research and regulatory approval at the time. The inconsistency of approved indications between countries due to national applications adds to the complexity. Finally, a fading research interest once drugs become generic points to a general deficit in the post-marketing evaluation of medicines. Far from claiming completeness, this narrative review aimed to illustrate the challenges that physicians encounter when trying to balance benefits and risks in a situation of incomplete and inconsistent data on longstanding treatment concepts.

In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of different formulations composed of ibuprofen (IBP), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DXP) in combination with ciprofloxacin (CIP), gentamicin (GEN), cefepime (FEP), imipenem (IPM), and meropenem (MEM) on clinical isolates of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) as well as the transcription levels of biofilm-associated genes in the presence of sub-MICs of IBP, ASA, and DXP. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs), and minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) of CIP, GEN, FEP, IPM, and MEM with/without sub-MICs of IBP (200 µg/mL), ASA (200 µg/mL), and DXP (500 µg/mL) for the clinical isolates were determined by the microbroth dilution method. Quantitative real-time-PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of biofilm-related genes, including <i>icaA</i> in <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>algD</i> in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> at sub-MICs of IBP, ASA, and DXP. All <i>S. aureus</i> isolates were methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA), and all <i>P. aeruginosa</i> were resistant to carbapenems. IBP decreased the levels of MIC, MBIC, and MBEC for all antibiotic agents in both clinical isolates, except for FEP among <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates. In MRSA isolates, ASA decreased the MICs of GEN, FEP, and IPM and the MBICs of IPM and MEM. In <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, ASA decreased the MICs of FEP, IPM, and MEM, the MBICs of FEP and MEM, and the MBEC of FEP. DXP increased the MICs of CIP, GEN, and FEP, and the MBICs of CIP, GEN, and FEP among both clinical isolates. The MBECs of CIP and FEP for MRSA isolates and the MBECs of CIP, GEN, and MEM among <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates increased in the presence of DXP. IBP and ASA at 200 µg/mL significantly decreased the transcription level of <i>algD</i> in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and IBP significantly decreased the transcription level of <i>icaA</i> in <i>S. aureus</i>. DXP at 500 µg/mL significantly increased the expression levels of <i>algD</i> and <i>icaA</i> genes in <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates, respectively.

In a previous work, we have shown that Weblike film forming systems (also called Pouches Drug Delivery Systems, PDDS) enable enhanced skin delivery of the incorporated molecules. These delivery systems are composed of one or more phospholipids, a short-chain alcohol, a polymer and optionally water. In this work, we continue the investigation and characterization of Weblike carriers focusing on some factors affecting the delivery properties such as components concentration and mode of application on the skin. Upon non-occluded application on the skin, the systems dry rapidly, forming a web-like structured film. Lidocaine, Ibuprofen, FITC and Cannabidiol are molecules with various physico-chemical properties that were incorporated in the carrier. The systems were tested in a number of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results of the in vitro permeation of Ibuprofen through porcine skin indicated two-fold delivery through the skin of Ibuprofen when applied from our Weblike system in comparison with a nanovesicular carrier, the ethosome. We also have investigated weblike systems containing hemp seed oil (HSO). This addition enhanced the film's ability to deliver lipophilic molecules to the deeper skin layers, leading to an improved pharmacodynamic effect. In analgesic tests carried out in a pain mice model following one hour application of CBD in Weblike system with and without HSO, the number of writhing episodes was decreased from 29 in the untreated animals to 9.5 and 18.5 writhes, respectively.

Drug formulation developers were initially intrigued by its surfactant qualities, and gradually it made its way into the toolkit of pharmaceutical drug delivery. Since then, four drugs with TPGS in their formulation have been approved for sale in the United States and Europe including ibuprofen, tipranavir, amprenavir, and tocophersolan. Improvement and implementation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for disease are goals of nanomedicine and the succeeding field of nanotheranostics. Specifically, imaging and treating tumors with nanohybrid theranostics shows promising potential. Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin are examples of poorly bioavailable therapeutic agents; hence, much effort is applied for developing TPGS-based nanomedicine, nanotheranostics, and targeted drug delivery systems to increase circulation time and promote the reticular endothelial escape of these drug delivery systems. TPGS has been used in a number of ways for improving drug solubility, bioavailability improvement, and prevention of drug efflux from the targeted cells, which makes it an excellent candidate for therapeutic delivery. Through the downregulation of P-gp expression and modulation of efflux pump activity, TPGS can also mitigate multidrug resistance (MDR). Novel materials such as TPGS-based copolymers are being studied for their potential use in various diseases. In recent clinical trials, TPGS has been utilized in a huge number of Phase I, II, and III studies. Additionally, numerous TPGS-based nanomedicine and nanotheranostic applications are reported in the literature which are in their preclinical stage. However, various randomized or human clinical trials have been underway for TPGS-based drug delivery systems for multiple diseases such as pneumonia, malaria, ocular disease, keratoconus, etc. In this review, we have emphasized in detail the review of the nanotheranostics and targeted drug delivery approaches premised on TPGS.

Designing topical formulations with maximum drug efficiency requires the optimization of the permeation and the stability of the drug. The present study focuses on the physical stability of amorphous drugs within the formulation. Ibuprofen is commonly used in topical formulations and then was selected as a model drug. Additionally, its low Tg allows easy, unexpected recrystallization at room temperature with negative consequence on skin penetration. In this study, the physical stability of amorphous ibuprofen was investigated in two types of formulations: (i) in terpenes-based deep eutectic solvents (DES) and (ii) in arginine-based co-amorphous blends. The phase diagram of ibuprofen:L-menthol was mainly analyzed by low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, leading to the evidence of ibuprofen recrystallization in a wide range of ibuprofen concentration. By contrast, it was shown that amorphous ibuprofen is stabilized when dissolved in thymol:menthol DES. Forming co-amorphous arginine-ibuprofen blends by melting is another route for stabilizing amorphous ibuprofen, while recrystallization was detected in the same co-amorphous mixtures obtained by cryo-milling. The mechanism of stabilization is discussed from determining T<sub>g</sub> and analyzing H-bonding interactions by Raman investigations in the C=O and O-H stretching regions. It was found that recrystallization of ibuprofen was inhibited by the inability to form dimers inherent to the preferential formation of heteromolecular H-bonding, regardless of the glass transition temperatures of the various mixtures.

This study evaluated solvent-free hot-melt extrusion (HME) for forming cyclodextrin inclusion complexes to improve the solubility and dissolution of ibuprofen (IBU). Molecular docking confirmed IBU's hosting in Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβ-CD), while phase solubility revealed its complex stoichiometry and stability. In addition, an 11 mm twin-screw co-rotating extruder with PVP VA-64 as an auxiliary substance aided the complex formation and extrusion. Using QbD and the Box-Behnken design, we studied variables (barrel temperature, screw speed, and polymer concentration) and their impact on solubility and dissolution. The high polymer concentration and high screw speeds positively affected the dependent variables. However, higher temperatures had a negative effect. The lowest barrel temperature set near the Tg of the polymer, when combined with high polymer concentrations, resulted in high torques in HME and halted the extrusion process. Therefore, the temperature and polymer concentration should be selected to provide sufficient melt viscosities to aid the complex formation and extrusion process. Studies such as DSC and XRD revealed the amorphous conversion of IBU, while the inclusion complex formation was demonstrated by ATR and NMR studies.

This work has the main aim of reinforcing the barrier effect of oral mucosa with a series of formulations to reduce permeation. Transmembrane water loss of different formulations was evaluated, and three of them were selected to be tested on the sublingual mucosa permeation of drugs. Caffeine, ibuprofen, dexamethasone, and ivermectin were applied on porcine skin, mucosa, and modified mucosa in order to compare the effectiveness of the formulations.

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability evaluation tools are needed to explore drugs' ability to access the CNS. An outstanding aspect of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models is the integration of knowledge on drug-specific and system-specific characteristics, allowing the identification of the relevant factors involved in target site distribution. We aimed to qualify a PBPK platform model to be used as a tool to predict CNS concentrations when significant transporter activity is absent and human data are sparse or unavailable. Data from the literature on the plasma and CNS of rats and humans regarding acetaminophen, oxycodone, lacosamide, ibuprofen, and levetiracetam were collected. Human BBB permeability values were extrapolated from rats using inter-species differences in BBB surface area. The percentage of predicted AUC and Cmax within the 1.25-fold criterion was 85% and 100% for rats and humans, respectively, with an overall GMFE of <1.25 in all cases.

However, oral administration of NSAIDs is frequently associated with adverse effects due to their inhibitory effect on the constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase enzyme 1 (COX-1) in, for instance, the gastrointestinal tract. A systemic delivery, such as a buccal delivery, of NSAIDs would be beneficial and additionally has the advantage of a non-invasive administration route, especially favourable for children or the elderly. To investigate the transport of NSAIDs across the buccal mucosa and determine their potential for buccal therapeutic usage, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and piroxicam were tested using an established oral mucosa Transwell<sup>®</sup> model based on human cell line TR146. Carboxyfluorescein and diazepam were applied as internal paracellular and transcellular marker molecule, respectively. Calculated permeability coefficients revealed a transport ranking of ibuprofen > piroxicam > diclofenac > celecoxib. Transporter protein inhibitor verapamil increased the permeability for ibuprofen, piroxicam and celecoxib, whereas probenecid increased the permeability for all tested NSAIDs. Furthermore, influence of local inflammation of the buccal mucosa on the transport of NSAIDs was mimicked by treating cells with a cytokine mixture of TNF-α, IL-1ß and IFN-γ followed by transport studies with ibuprofen (+ probenecid). Cellular response to pro-inflammatory stimuli was confirmed by upregulation of cytokine targets at the mRNA level, increased secreted cytokine levels and a significant decrease in the paracellular barrier. Permeability of ibuprofen was increased across cell layers treated with cytokines, while addition of probenecid increased permeability of ibuprofen in controls, but not across cell layers treated with cytokines. In summary, the suitability of the in vitro oral mucosa model to measure NSAID transport rankings was demonstrated, and the involvement of transporter proteins was confirmed; an inflammation model was established, and increased NSAID transport upon inflammation was measured.",2024,,"Lin GC, Friedl HP, Grabner S, Gerhartl A, Neuhaus W.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040543,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To tackle this issue, we built a model with four different types of primary liver cells: hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. We cultured them in different combinations of composition and volumes of cell medium, hepatocyte proportions of total cells and additions of extracellular matrixes. We added rifampicin (RIF), ibuprofen (IBU) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to this model and observed the microanatomy and physiology changes for a week with preclinical and clinical instruments. Among the different model configurations, we selected the feature combination of the in vitro model that had similar biomarker values to those measured in clinical diagnostics. When we exposed the selected model configuration to RIF, IBU and 5-FU, we observed similar glucose, triglyceride and albumin dynamics as in vivo (from clinical data). Therefore, we have built an in vitro liver model that resembles the liver microenvironment, and we have analysed it with clinical instrumentation to facilitate data translation.

We aimed to use the freeze-drying method to create a novel approach for preparing CD-MOFs. MOFs consisting of γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) and potassium cations (K<sup>+</sup>) were employed to encapsulate the poorly water-soluble model drug Ibuprofen (IBU) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF).<h4>Methods</h4>Using the LeanQbD<sup>®</sup> software (v2022), we designed the experiments based on the Quality by Design (QbD) concept. According to QbD, we identified the three most critical factors, which were the molar ratio of the IBU to the γCD, incubation time, and the percentage of the organic solvent. light-, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and laser diffraction were utilized to observe the morphology and particle size of the samples. In addition, the products were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).<h4>Results</h4>Based on characterizations, we concluded that a γCD-MOF/IBU complex was also formed using the freeze-drying method. Using formulations with optimal aerodynamic properties, we achieved 38.10 ± 5.06 and 47.18 ± 4.18 Fine Particle Fraction% (FPF%) based on the Andersen Cascade Impactor measurement.

In the present work, we investigate if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug substances (NSAIDs) interact with substrate transport via human (h)PAT1. <b>Methods</b>: The transport of substrates via hPAT1 was investigated in Caco-2 cells using radiolabeled substrate uptake and in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes injected with <i>hPAT1 cRNA</i>, measuring induced currents using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The molecular interaction between NSAIDs and hPAT1 was investigated using an AlphaFold2 model and molecular docking. <b>Results:</b> NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, and flurbiprofen inhibited proline uptake via hPAT1, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 954 (logIC<sub>50</sub> 2.98 ± 0.1) µM, 272 (logIC<sub>50</sub> 2.43 ± 0.1) µM, and 280 (logIC<sub>50</sub> 2.45 ± 0.1) µM, respectively. Ibuprofen acted as a non-competitive inhibitor of hPAT1-mediated proline transport. In hPAT1-expressing oocytes, ibuprofen and diclofenac did not induce inward currents, and inhibited inward currents caused by proline. Molecular modeling pointed to a binding mode involving an allosteric site. <b>Conclusions:</b> NSAIDs interact with hPAT1 as non-translocated non-competitive inhibitors, and molecular modeling points to a binding mode involving an allosteric site distinct from the substrate binding site.

However, the relationships between the coated-copolymer encapsulation and drug delivery performance in the hybrid nanocomposites was rarely reported. Therefore, the main objectives of the present work are to explore the cell uptake, cellular internalization, cytotoxicity, and hemolysis performance of the fluorescent hybrid materials with different polymer-encapsulated amounts. <b>Methods:</b> Using (2-(2-aminoethyl)-6-(dimethylamino)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione)-doped poly[(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-(acrylic acid)] (PAN) as a shell and bimodal mesoporous silicas (BMMs) as a core, the dual pH- and temperature-responsive mesoporous PAN@M-BMMs with the fluorescent performances were synthesized via a radical polymerization approach. The effects of the PAN-coated thicknesses on their physicochemical properties and structural features were demonstrated via XRD and SAXS patterns, SEM and TEM images, FT-IR spectra, and TG analysis. Their mass fractal (<i>D<sub>m</sub></i>) evolutions were elucidated on the basis of the SAXS patterns and fluorescence spectra. <b>Results:</b> The <i>D<sub>m</sub></i> values increased from 2.74 to 2.87 with an increase of the PAN-coated amount from 17 to 26.5% along with the particle size from 76.1 to 85.6 nm and blue-shifting of their fluorescent emission wavelength from 470 to 444 nm. Meanwhile, the PAN@M-BMMs exhibited a high ibuprofen (IBU) loading capacity (13.8%) and strong dual pH-/temperature-responsive drug-releasing performances (83.1%) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C, as comparison with that (17.9%) at pH 2.0 and 37 °C. The simulated results confirmed that the adsorption energy decreased from -67.18 kJ/mol for pure BMMs to -116.76 kJ/mol for PAN@M-BMMs, indicating the PAN-grafting on the surfaces of the BMMs core was beneficial to improve its IBU-adsorption capacity. Its uptake in the HeLa cell line was performed via microplate readers, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and ICP measurement, showing a low cytotoxicity at a concentration up to 100 µg/mL. Specially, P<sub>0.2</sub>AN@M-BMMs had a superior cellular uptake and fluorescence properties via the time-dependent uptake experiments, and exhibited the highest silicon content via the cellular internalization analysis, as compared to other carriers.

Recent regulatory authority guidelines emphasise a systematic, risk-based approach to evaluating these interactions, underscoring the need for mechanistic insight. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), modulate cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, reducing the metabolism of CYP substrates. Cytokine antagonists (such as IL-6 receptor antagonists) can counteract this effect, restoring CYP activity and increasing drug clearance. However, quantitative prediction of cytokine-mediated drug interactions remains challenging, as existing models often lack the mechanistic detail needed to capture the dynamic relationship between cytokine signalling, receptor engagement, and downstream modulation of drug metabolism. <b>Methods:</b> A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework incorporating cytokine-receptor binding, subsequent downregulation of CYP expression, and blockade of the cytokine signalling by a therapeutic protein antagonist was developed to simulate and investigate cytokine antagonist-drug interactions. Tocilizumab, a humanised IL-6 receptor antagonist used to treat several inflammatory conditions associated with elevated IL-6 levels, was selected as a model drug to demonstrate the utility of the framework. <b>Results:</b> The developed PBPK model accurately predicted the pharmacokinetics profiles of tocilizumab and captured clinically observed dynamic changes in simvastatin exposure before and after tocilizumab treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Simulated IL-6 dynamics aligned with observed clinical profiles, showing transient elevation following receptor blockade and associated restoration of CYP3A4 activity. Prospective simulations with commonly co-administered CYP substrates (celecoxib, chloroquine, cyclosporine, ibuprofen, prednisone, simvastatin, and theophylline) in RA patients revealed dose regimen- and drug-dependent differences in interaction magnitude. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrated the utility of PBPK models in providing a mechanistic understanding of cytokine antagonist-drug interactions, supporting enhanced therapeutic decision-making and optimising patient care in inflammatory conditions.",2025,,"Pan X, Liu C, Stader F, Derbalah A, Jamei M, Gardner I.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics17070896,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

For example, hydrophilic and hydrophobic PSi microparticles have been utilized to improve the dissolution rate of poorly soluble drugs and to sustain peptide delivery. Previously, the well-plate method has been demonstrated to be a suitable in vitro dissolution method for hydrophilic PSi particles but it was not applicable to poorly wetting hydrophobic thermally hydrocarbonized PSi (THCPSi) particles. In this work, three different in vitro dissolution techniques, namely centrifuge, USP Apparatus 1 (basket) and well-plate methods were compared by using hydrophilic thermally carbonized PSi (TCPSi) microparticles loaded with poorly soluble ibuprofen or freely soluble antipyrine. All the methods showed a fast and complete or nearly complete release of both model compounds from the TCPSi microparticles indicating that all methods described in vitro dissolution equally. Based on these results, the centrifuge method was chosen to study the release of a peptide (ghrelin antagonist) from the THCPSi microparticles since it requires small sample amounts and achieves good particle suspendability. Sustained peptide release from the THCPSi microparticles was observed, which is in agreement with an earlier in vivo study.

This narrative review aims to provide an up-to-date evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and clinical use of intravenous (IV) NSAIDs for perioperative pain management in adults and children. The NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) approved in Europe for the short-term symptomatic treatment of acute, moderate perioperative pain via IV infusion in adults and/or children have been influenced by US and global guidelines and practice: the drugs primarily reviewed here are ibuprofen, ketorolac, ketoprofen, naproxen, paracetamol, and acetylsalicylic acid. Furthermore, intravenous ibuprofen is authorized for the short-term symptomatic treatment of fever. In contrast to intravenous ketoprofen, intravenous ibuprofen is authorized for administration to children over 6 years of age or weighing more than 20 kg. Overall, IV ibuprofen had a more favorable profile with regard to peri- and postoperative opioid sparing and pain relief. Oral ibuprofen and IV ibuprofen have similar levels of efficacy, although IV ibuprofen has a shorter onset of action and is required in patients who are unable to take oral medications. The frequency of significant adverse events appears to be similar for ibuprofen and paracetamol. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses report that intravenous NSAIDs reduce postoperative opioid consumption by approximately 20-60%, improving pain management with fewer opioid-related side effects.

Their development led to many applications for drug delivery, where drugs can be released in a pH-dependent manner. Crosslinking hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG), a biocompatible building block bearing high end-group functionality, using oxalic acid (OA), a diacid that can be synthesized from CO<sub>2</sub> and form highly activated ester bonds, can generate this type of smart hydrogel. Aiming to understand the process of developing this novel material and its drug release for oral administration, its formation was studied by varying reactant stoichiometry, concentration and cure procedure and temperature; it was characterized regarding gel percent (%gel), swelling degree (%S), FTIR and thermal behavior; impregnated using ibuprofen, as a model drug, and a release study was carried out at pH 2 and 7. Hydrogel formation was evidenced by its insolubility, FTIR spectra and an increase in T<sub>d</sub> and T<sub>g</sub>; a pre-cure step was shown to be crucial for its formation and an increase in the concentration of the reactants led to higher %gel and lower %S. The impregnation resulted in a matrix-encapsulated system; and the ibuprofen release was negligible at pH 2 but completed at pH 7 due to the hydrolysis of the matrix.

The fabrication process involved the use of 3D printing and coaxial electrospinning technologies. Specifically, we utilized a lab-developed solution-extrusion 3D printer to fabricate polycaprolactone (PCL) meshes. Then, bi-layered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanofibrous membranes, which embedded ibuprofen and epidermal growth factor (EGF), were prepared utilizing electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning techniques, respectively. To ensure the quality of the produced mesh and spun nanofibers, we carried out a characterization process. Furthermore, we estimated the in vitro and in vivo release characteristics of ibuprofen and EGF, respectively, using high-performance liquid chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In addition, we assessed the effectiveness of hybrid nanofibrous mats for preserving the alveolar ridge by adopting an animal model and conducting a histology examination. The study findings demonstrate that the nanofibrous mats provided a continuous discharge of ibuprofen and EGF for more than four weeks. Moreover, the animal test carried out in vivo showed that animals implanted with this combination of mesh and drug-eluting mats displayed considerably greater mobility than those without mats.

We reported that the synthesis of polyethyleneimine-based sponges was achieved through cryo-polymerization using 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) as the crosslinking agent. Subsequent functionalization with resorcinol diglycidyl ether (RDGE) and trimethylamine introduced quaternary ammonium cations, imparting strong basicity and hydrophilicity, as well as phenyl groups, conferring hydrophobic characteristics, respectively. The aforementioned sponge material, S<sub>HPE-QPI</sub>, primarily facilitates the efficient adsorption of IBU in aqueous solutions through the anion exchange properties of quaternary ammonium groups and the π-π interactions associated with oxygen-activated benzene rings. Various characterizations, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and specific surface area determination method (BET), confirmed the successful synthesis of the bifunctionalized S<sub>HPEI-QP</sub> adsorbent. This adsorbent features a porous structure (specific surface area of 77.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and pore size distribution of 25-100 nm) and an isoelectric point (pH<sub>pzc</sub>) of 9.38. The adsorption kinetics of the adsorbent for IBU were extremely rapid and conformed to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherm aligned with the Langmuir isotherm model. Noteworthily, S<sub>HPEI-QP</sub> demonstrated an exceptionally high adsorption capacity for IBU, achieving a maximum uptake of 905.73 mg g<sup>-1</sup> at pH 7.0, which surpassed that of most of the previous reported adsorbents. Moreover, the sponge material can be chemically regenerated. After eight cycles of use, the adsorption efficiency decreased by only 4%.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the solid state of cocrystalline phase of ibuprofen-nicotinamide, determine the solubility, and evaluate its in vivo analgesic activity. The cocrystal of ibuprofen-nicotinamide was prepared by a slow evaporation method. The solid-state characterization was conducted by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis, differential thermal analysis (DTA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To investigate the in vivo analgesic activity, 28 male Swiss-Webster mice were injected with acetic acid 0.5% following oral administration of intact ibuprofen, physical mixture, and its cocrystalline phase with nicotinamide (equivalent to 26 mg/kg ibuprofen).

In this context, the article reviews the occurrence, transport, fate, and electrochemical removal of some selected NSAIDs (diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NPX)) using carbon-based anodes in the aquatic environment. However, no specific protocol has been developed to date, and various approaches have been adopted for the sampling and elimination processes of NSAIDs from wastewater samples. The mean concentration of selected NSAIDs from different countries varies considerably, ranging between 3992−27,061 µg/L (influent wastewater) and 1208−7943 µg/L (effluent wastewater). An assessment of NSAIDs removal efficiency across different treatment stages in various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been performed. Overall, NSAIDs removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants has been reported to be around 4−89%, 8−100%, 16−100%, and 17−98% for DIC, KTP, NPX, and IBU, respectively. A microbiological reactor (MBR) has been proclaimed to be the most reliable treatment technique for NSAIDs removal (complete removal). Chlorination (81−95%) followed by conventional mechanical biological treatment (CMBT) (94−98%) treatment has been demonstrated to be the most efficient in removing NSAIDs. Further, the present review explains that the electrochemical oxidation process is an alternative process for the treatment of NSAIDs using a carbon-based anode. Different carbon-based carbon anodes have been searched for electrochemical removal of selected NSAIDs.

This study investigates the differential effects of seasonally-varied dissolved organic matter (DOM) from Songhua River and Liao River on the photodegradation of pharmaceutical pollutants, using levofloxacin (LFX), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and ibuprofen (IBP) as target compounds. The results demonstrated that summer and autumn DOM inhibited the photodegradation of LFX and SMZ through light screening and dynamic quenching effects, with inhibition rates of 35.1% and 55.5%, respectively, whereas winter DOM enhanced degradation through photo-oxidation mechanisms. DOM from Songhua River and Liao River significantly promoted the photodegradation of IBP. Quenching experiments showed differences in the contributions of photochemically reactive intermediates (PPRIs) to the photodegradation of different target pollutants, with hydroxyl radicals (•OH) dominating LFX photodegradation (48.79% contribution), excited triplet states of DOM (<sup>3</sup>DOM*) dominating SMZ photodegradation (85.20% contribution), and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) dominating IBP photodegradation (79.89% contribution). The photodegradation pathways were elucidated by measuring the photodegradation by-products of the target pollutants: LFX mainly underwent piperazine ring cleavage and oxidative decarboxylation, SMZ underwent isoxazole ring opening and deamination during photodegradation, and IBP underwent photodecarboxylation and oxidation reactions. Under the influence of the DOM from the Songhua River and Liao River, the generation of multiple photodegradation by-products led to an increasing trend in the acute toxicity of target pollutants to luminescent bacteria. This investigation elucidates the dual regulatory mechanisms of natural aquatic DOM on both photo-induced degradation pathways and toxicity evolution dynamics of pharmaceutical contaminants, which is of great significance for understanding the photochemical transformation behavior and risk assessment of pharmaceutical pollutants in aquatic environments.",2025,,"Chen Y, Cui J, Cheng F, Qu J, Zhang YN.",https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics13060450,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

PBUTs are associated with comorbidities and mortality in dialysis patients. Albumin is the primary carrier for PBUTs and only a small free fraction of PBUTs are dialyzable. In the past, we proposed a novel method where a binding competitor is infused upstream of a dialyzer into an extracorporeal circuit. The competitor competes with PBUTs for their binding sites on albumin and increases the free PBUT fraction. Essentially, binding competitor-augmented hemodialysis is a reactive membrane separation technique and is a paradigm shift from conventional dialysis therapies. The proposed method has been tested in silico, ex vivo, and in vivo, and has proven to be very effective in all scenarios. In an ex vivo study and a proof-of-concept clinical study with 18 patients, ibuprofen was used as a binding competitor; however, chronic ibuprofen infusion may affect residual kidney function. Binding competition with free fatty acids significantly improved PBUT removal in pre-clinical rat models. Based on in silico analysis, tryptophan can also be used as a binding competitor; importantly, fatty acids or tryptophan may have salutary effects in HD patients.

Protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) are related to cardiovascular and overall mortality, and they are difficult to remove with current hemodialysis treatments. The PBUT displacers, such as furosemide, tryptophan, or ibuprofen, may be promising new strategies for improving their clearance. This study aims to compare ibuprofen versus other analgesic drugs in PBUT removal. A prospective study was carried out in 23 patients. Patients underwent four dialysis sessions with routine dialysis parameters, except for analgesic drugs administered (lysine acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, dexketoprofen, and ibuprofen). The reduction ratios (RRs) of a wide range of molecular weight molecules were assessed, including total p-cresyl sulfate and total indoxyl-sulfate. There were no complications related to the administered drug, and pain was controlled independently of the drug. There were no differences in the RR of small-size and medium-sized molecules between all four study treatments. However, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate RRs when ibuprofen was administered were significantly higher than lysine acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and dexketoprofen treatments.

Hence, preparing novel formulations with augmented absorption is a challenge in pharmaceutical industries. In this paper, we have examined the effect of basic amino acids including arginine (ARG), lysine (LYS), and glucosamine (GlucN) on the solubility of ibuprofen (IBU) and piroxicam (PXM) as drugs with limited solubility. We have also studied the effect of the dissolution media with the pH values 1.2 to 7.4.<h4>Methods</h4>The saturation shake-flask method was used for solubility studies in the presence of amino acids. Briefly, buffer solutions containing different concentrations of amino acids were prepared. Then, an excess amount of each drug with these buffers was shaken to reach equilibrium. After 48 hours, the upper phase was separated, and solubility was calculated by reading their UV-Vis absorbance.<h4>Results</h4>The results illustrated that amino acids increased solubility of both drugs with different ratios, which were pH and concentration-dependent. Solubility improved as the amount of amino acids went up, and this upward pattern was more robust with ARG than LYS. The presence of GlucN in citrate buffer significantly enhanced IBU solubility.

Bupleurum or TSS is frequently utilized in clinical practice alongside other medications (such as entecavir, lamivudine, compound paracetamol and amantadine hydrochloride capsules), leading to an increased risk of drug-drug interactions. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family serves a critical role in the metabolism of numerous essential drugs (such as tamoxifen, ibuprofen and phenytoin), where the majority of drug interactions involve CYP-mediated metabolism. It is therefore essential to understand the effects of key components of Bupleurum on CYPs when administering combination therapies containing TSS or Bupleurum. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of TSS on the mRNA and protein expression of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 in HepaRG cells. The effects of TSS on the survival of HepaRG cells was investigated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot (WB) analysis were used to assess the effects of different concentrations of TSS (0, 5, 10 and 15 µg/ml) on CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 mRNA and protein expression in HepaRG cells. Based on the CCK-8 assay results, it was observed that the cell viability remained above 80% when treated with 1, 5, 10 and 15 µg/ml TSS. Although there was a statistically significant reduced cell viability at TSS concentrations of 10 and 15 µg/ml compared with the control group, the findings indicated that TSS did not exhibit notable cytotoxic effects at these concentrations. Furthermore, RT-qPCR results revealed that compared with those in the control group, TSS at concentrations of 10 and 15 µg/ml reduced CYP3A4 mRNA expression but increased CYP1A2 mRNA expression in HepaRG cells at concentrations of 15 µg/ml. WB analysis found that TSS at concentrations of 10 and 15 µg/ml downregulated CYP3A4 protein expression in HepaRG cells while increasing CYP1A2 protein expression at concentrations of 15 µg/ml. Results in the present study suggest that TSS can inhibit CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression, but exerts opposite effects on their CYP1A2 counterparts.

Our studies demonstrate that PGE(2) protects DC in vitro against apoptosis induced by withdrawal of growth factors or ceramide. DC matured in conditions that inhibit endogenous PGE(2) release are highly susceptible to apoptosis and exogenous PGE(2) re-establishes the more resistant phenotype. The antiapoptotic effect is mediated through EP-2/EP-4 receptors and involves the PI3K --> Akt pathway. PGE(2) leads to increased phosphorylation of Akt, protection against mitochondrial membrane compromise, and decreased caspase 3 activity. Macroarray data indicate that PGE(2) leads to the down-regulation of a number of proapoptotic molecules, i.e., BAD, several caspases, and granzyme B. In vivo, higher numbers of immature and Ag-loaded CFSE-labeled DC are present in the draining lymph nodes of mice inoculated with PGE(2) receptor agonists, compared with animals treated with ibuprofen or controls injected with PBS. This suggests that PGE(2) acts as an endogenous antiapoptotic factor for DC and raises the possibility of using PGE(2) agonists to increase the survival of Ag-loaded DC following in vivo administration.",2004,,"Vassiliou E, Sharma V, Jing H, Sheibanie F, Ganea D.",http://www.jimmunol.org/content/173/11/6955.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We aimed to investigate the neuroinflammation mechanism in developing rat brains associated with sevoflurane exposure time, by identifying the specific damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) pathway and evaluating the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in alleviating neuroinflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>A three-step experiment was conducted to investigate neuroinflammation induced by sevoflurane. First, the exposure time required for sevoflurane to cause neuroinflammation was determined. Next, the specific pathways of DAMPs involved in neuroinflammation by sevoflurane were identified. Finally, the effects of NSAIDs on sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation were investigated. The expression of various molecules in the rat brain were assessed using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 112 rats (aged 7 days) were used, of which six rats expired during the experiment (mortality rate, 5.3%). Expression of CD68, HMGB-1, galectin-3, TLR4, TLR9, and phosphorylated NF-κB was significantly increased upon 6 h of sevoflurane exposure. Conversely, transcriptional levels of TNF-α and IL-6 significantly increased and IFN-γ significantly decreased after 6 h of sevoflurane exposure. Co-administration of NSAIDs with sevoflurane anesthesia significantly attenuated TNF-α and IL-6 levels and restored IFN-γ levels.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In conclusion, 6 h of sevoflurane exposure induces neuroinflammation through the DAMPs pathway, HMGB-1, and galectin-3. Co-administration of ibuprofen reduced sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation.",2024,,"Joe YE, Jun JH, Oh JE, Lee JR.",https://doi.org/10.4097/kja.23796,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Opioids are indeed still at the mainstream of postoperative pain control, but solely using only opioids for postoperative pain management may be connected with risks of complications and adverse effects. As a consequence, the concept of multimodal analgesia has been proposed and is recommended whenever possible. Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drug for its good tolerance and high safety profiles. The introduction of intravenous form of acetaminophen has led to a wider flexibility of its use during peri- and postoperative periods, allowing the early initiation of multimodal analgesia. Many studies have revealed the efficacy, safety and opioid sparing effects of intravenous acetaminophen. Intravenous ibuprofen has also shown to be well tolerated and demonstrated to have significant opioid sparing effects during the postoperative period. However, the number of randomized controlled trials confirming the efficacy and safety is small and should be used in caution in certain group of patients. Intravenous acetaminophen and ibuprofen are important options for multimodal postoperative analgesia, improving pain and patient satisfaction.",2015,,"Koh W, Nguyen KP, Jahr JS.",https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2015.68.1.3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Characterization based on surface morphology, particle size, absolute drug content, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out on the SDs. The in vitro release of IB from the SDs was performed in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7.4) without enzymes, whereas the anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using egg albumin-induced rat paw edema model.<h4>Results</h4>Greenish brown, discrete, and irregularly shaped SDs of mean particle size range 113.5 ± 2.5-252.5 ± 1.9 μm, which were stable over 3 months, were obtained. The drug content of the SDs ranged from 73.4 ± 2.9 % to 83.5 ± 2.7%. Although the drug content increased with increased concentration of PEG 8000 in the SDs, the mean particle size decreased with increased concentration of PEG 8000 in the SDs. The FT-IR results indicate no strong chemical interaction of IB and PEG 8000 in the SDs. There was marked increase in the dissolution rate of IB from the SDs (P < 0.05) as compared to pure IB and physical mixture. The dissolution was better in SIF than in SGF. The increased dissolution rate of IB may be due to the formation of microcrystals, increased wettability and dispersibility in PEG 8000.

Diclofenac among the nonselective NSAIDs has the highest CV risk such as congestive heart failure, which resulted commonly from the impaired cardiac pumping due to a disrupted excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. We investigated the effects of diclofenac on the L-type calcium channels which are essential to the E-C coupling at the level of single ventricular myocytes isolated from neonatal rat heart, using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Only diclofenac of three NSAIDs, including naproxen and ibuprofen, significantly reduced inward whole cell currents. At concentrations higher than 3 microM, diclofenac inhibited reversibly the Na(+) current and did irreversibly the L-type Ca(2+) channels-mediated inward current (IC(50)=12.89+/-0.43 microM) in a dose-dependent manner. However, nifedipine, a well-known L-type channel blocker, effectively inhibited the L-type Ca(2+) currents but not the Na(+) current.

Efforts should be made to increase the success of anesthesia, thus diminishing negative dental experiences. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of preemptive analgesia on the success of pulpal anesthesia following inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) in children with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and on reducing postendodontic pain.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The research design was an <i>in vivo</i>, three-group, parallel, quadruple-blind study. A total of 75 patients were randomly allocated to one of the three groups-group I: ibuprofen, group II: combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol, and group III: multivitamin (placebo). Premedication was given 45 minutes before treatment, and patients received IANB in a standardized manner. Pain during pulpectomy was recorded using the face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scale and postoperatively using Wong-Baker's pain rating scale (WBPRS) at 4, 12, and 24 hours. Success was measured if the pain felt was of no or mild intensity.<h4>Results</h4>Success of IANB was 64% for ibuprofen, 72% for the combination group, and 40% for the placebo group, with no statistically significant difference between all groups (<i>p</i> = 0.06) on the FLACC scale. At 4 hours postoperatively, a significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.02) was found among groups with more children experiencing no or mild pain in groups I and II and the highest number of rescue medications taken by the placebo group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen and a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen as preemptive analgesics had no significant effect on the success rate of IANB, although it was effective in reducing pain at 4 hours postoperatively.<h4>How to cite this article</h4>Gori NA, Patel MC, Bhatt RK, <i>et al.</i> Clinical Assessment of Preemptive Analgesia on Success of Pulpal Anesthesia and Postendodontic Pain in Children with Irreversible Pulpitis: A Randomized Comparative Study.

The most common syndrome is acute mountain sickness (AMS) which usually begins within a few hours of ascent and typically consists of headache variably accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, disturbed sleep, fatigue, and dizziness. With millions of travelers journeying to high altitudes every year and sleeping above 2,500 m, acute mountain sickness is a wide-spread clinical condition. Risk factors include home elevation, maximum altitude, sleeping altitude, rate of ascent, latitude, age, gender, physical condition, intensity of exercise, pre-acclimatization, genetic make-up, and pre-existing diseases. At higher altitudes, sleep disturbances may become more profound, mental performance is impaired, and weight loss may occur. If ascent is rapid, acetazolamide can reduce the risk of developing AMS, although a number of high-altitude travelers taking acetazolamide will still develop symptoms. Ibuprofen can be effective for headache. Symptoms can be rapidly relieved by descent, and descent is mandatory, if at all possible, for the management of the potentially fatal syndromes of high-altitude pulmonary and cerebral edema.

There are insufficient data concerning the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the esophageal tissue. We aimed to examine the effects of well-known nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs using electrophysiologic criteria on the rabbit esophageal epithelium.<h4>Methods</h4>Esophageal epithelium mounted on Ussing chambers enabled in vitro investigation of the electrophysiological properties. Doses of 1 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the luminal side. Esophagi were cannulated from both sides for the administration of high-dose ibuprofen in vivo, and the potential difference was monitored.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen and aspirin inhibited tissue transport functions in a dose-dependent manner. pH 4 acid and 0.1 mg/mL ibuprofen alone were not harmful; however, the combination of these agents had an additive and significance effect: 78% decrease in the potential difference and 85% decrease in the short-circuited current (Isc). The change in the potential difference in the in vivo experiments (5 mg/mL ibuprofen) was similar (52 ± 7% decrease) with in vitro experiments in the first 30 minutes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were harmful to the rabbit esophageal epithelium in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Even though aspirin and ibuprofen affected the transport mechanisms of the esophageal epithelium, the dose-dependent decrease of tissue potential difference and Isc with ibuprofen was more pronounced than those with aspirin.

Vaginal infections are commonly treated with causal antimicrobial treatments. In addition to specific antimicrobial treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy, both systemic or topical (vaginal douche), could be useful in the integrated treatment approach of these conditions reducing symptoms and speeding up the recovery in vulvovaginitis. Ibuprofen is a well-known effective and well-tolerated anti-COX (anti-COX1 and COX2) compound. In addition, several in vitro studies suggest that Ibuprofen shares antimicrobial and antifungal activities. Ibuprofen isobutanolammonium (Ib-isb) (Ginenorm) is a soluble salt from formulation suitable for external and intravaginal use. This salt completely dissociates in aqueous solution. Ib-isob is available in sachet and vaginal douche pharmaceutical formulations. Clinical efficacy of Ib-isob has been documented in 10 clinical studies (6 controlled and 4 open trials) which have enrolled in total 399 women with vulvovaginitis. The six controlled clinical trials were performed both versus placebo (2 studies) or versus active comparators such as benzydamine. In these studied, Ib-Isb has been used in general for 7 consecutive days with a twice application daily regimen at the dose of 1 g per application. Topical application of Ib-isob induced a marked and rapid reduction in signs (erythema, oedema) and symptoms (itching and burning sensation) of vulvovaginitis. In head-to-head studies carried out in comparison with other topical products, Ib-isob induced a more rapid reduction in both subjective and objective symptoms. In particular a remarkable significant improvement of all the symptoms has been observed in the group of patients treated with Ib-isob in comparison with women receiving benzydamine. The clinical data available for Ib-isob confirm that this salt, specifically developed for gynecological use, is effective and well tolerated in vulvovaginal inflammation conditions. Efficacy of Ib-isob was greater in comparison with commonly used products.

While topical formulations have been explored in pain research, there is no published literature evaluating the efficacy in radicular pain. We present the first three cases of radicular pain successfully treated with a topical formulation of diclofenac, ibuprofen, baclofen, cyclobenzaprine, bupivacaine, gabapentin, and pentoxifylline (T7).<h4>Case presentation</h4>Case series evaluating T7 for treatment of radicular pain in a single, outpatient pain center. Pain was rated on the numeric rating scale (NRS) on initial evaluation and follow up after a trial of T7. One to two grams of T7 was applied to the affected area 3 - 4 times daily in addition to the patient's baseline pharmacologic management. Three patients with median age of 50 (range, 39 to 65) and diagnosis of cervical and/or lumbosacral radicular pain participated. Two of the three had chronic radicular pain despite use of analgesic agents, spinal injections and failed spinal surgery syndrome. Each reported subjective improvement in radicular pain, function and sleep. There was an average decrease in NRS score consistent with 30% - 40% global improvement in symptoms, clinically significant based on the minimal clinically important difference for radicular pain. T7 was well tolerated without adverse reactions. Surgery was prevented or delayed in all cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first report of the successful treatment of radicular pain with a topical agent.

The occurrence of PDA is inversely related to gestational age and weight, with an even greater incidence in preterm infants. The maintenance of ductal patency is essential for the normal development of the fetus. In the neonate, however, persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (DA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Normally, at birth, the DA constricts, resulting in intraluminal ischemic hypoxia, which eventually leads to closure and remodeling of the ductus. PDA in term infants is usually associated with a functional defect, whereas in preterm infants it is associated with immaturity. Normal physiologic mechanisms contributing to closure - oxygen tension and decreased prostaglandins-are altered in prematurity. Clinical signs of ductal patency include murmur, tachycardia, bounding peripheral pulses, and congestive heart failure and associated symptoms. Symptoms are not always present; therefore, diagnostic imaging is critical if a PDA is suspected on clinical grounds. Three management strategies are currently available for PDA: fluid restriction and diuretics (as clinically appropriate), medical intervention, and surgical ligation. Pharmacologic closure can be achieved via administration of intravenous indomethacin or ibuprofen lysine.

Recently, albumin-binding PSMA radioligands with enhanced blood circulation were developed to increase the tumor accumulation of activity. The present study aimed at the design, synthesis and preclinical evaluation of a novel class of PSMA-targeting radioligands equipped with ibuprofen as a weak albumin-binding entity in order to improve the pharmacokinetic properties. <b>Methods</b>: Four novel glutamate-urea-based PSMA ligands were synthesized with ibuprofen, conjugated via variable amino acid-based linker entities. The albumin-binding properties of the <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled PSMA ligands were tested <i>in vitro</i> using mouse and human plasma. Affinity of the radioligands to PSMA and cellular uptake and internalization was investigated using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP and PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumor cells. The tissue distribution profile of the radioligands was assessed in biodistribution and imaging studies using PC-3 PIP/flu tumor-bearing nude mice. <b>Results</b>: The PSMA ligands were obtained in moderate yields at high purity (>99%). <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeling of the ligands was achieved at up to 100 MBq/nmol with >96% radiochemical purity. <i>In vitro</i> assays confirmed high binding of all radioligands to mouse and human plasma proteins and specific uptake and internalization into PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor cells. Biodistribution studies and SPECT/CT scans revealed high accumulation in PC-3 PIP tumors but negligible uptake in PC-3 flu tumor xenografts as well as rapid clearance of activity from background organs and tissues. <sup>177</sup>Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA, in which ibuprofen was conjugated via a positively-charged diaminobutyric acid (DAB) entity, showed distinguished tumor uptake and the most favorable tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-kidney ratios. <b>Conclusion</b>: The high accumulation of activity in the tumor and fast clearance from background organs was a common favorable characteristic of PSMA radioligands modified with ibuprofen as albumin-binding entity. <sup>177</sup>Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA emerged as the most promising candidate; hence, more detailed preclinical investigations with this radioligand are warranted in view of a clinical translation.",2020,,"Deberle LM, Benešová M, Umbricht CA, Borgna F, Büchler M, Zhernosekov K, Schibli R, Müller C.",https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.40482,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although there are numerous probes available for detecting HOCl in the OA region, probes with dual functions of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities are still significantly lacking. While this type of probe can reduce the time gap between diagnosis and treatment, which is clinically needed. <b>Methods:</b> We developed a fluorescent probe (DHU-CBA1) toward HOCl with theranostics functions through the release of methylene blue (MB) and ibuprofen (IBP) in this work. DHU-CBA1 can detect HOCl with high specificity and sensitivity, releasing MB and IBP with an impressive efficiency of ≥ 95% <i>in vitro</i>. <b>Results:</b> DHU-CBA1 exhibits good biosafety, enabling <i>in vivo</i> imaging of endogenous HOCl, along with reducing arthritis scores, improving synovitis and cartilage damage, and maintaining catabolic balance while alleviating senescence in cartilage. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study proposes a novel approach to enhance osteoarthritis therapy by releasing IBP via a smart HOCl-enabled fluorescent probe.",2024,,"Lu Z, Wei P, Peng H, Jiang L, Wu P, Yi T.",https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.96958,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In the United States, approximately 9,500 cases of CCB intoxication due to deliberate or inadvertent overdose were reported to poison centers in 2002. We present a case of a patient who presented with CCB overdose complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and recalcitrant shock all of which resolved with methylene blue therapy. We present a case of a 56-year-old African American woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) after intentional ingestion of large amounts of multiple pills likely consisting of cyclobenzaprine, amlodipine, losartan, and ibuprofen following an argument with her boyfriend. Treatment included insulin drip, 10% dextrose, and norepinephrine drip which was titrated up. First insulin drip and 10% dextrose were titrated up; however, vasopressor-resistant hypotension persisted, and the decision was made to administer methylene blue. Over 9,500 cases of CCB toxicity were reported to poison centers in the US in 2002. Although no definitive treatment is outlined, first-line therapy consists of IV calcium, high-dose insulin, and vasopressor support with either norepinephrine or epinephrine. Traditionally, methylene blue is used for methemoglobinemia and in cardiothoracic ICUs for post coronary artery bypass vasoplegia. It acts by selectively inhibiting nitric oxide-activated cyclic guanylate cyclase leading to decreased vasodilation of arteriolar smooth muscles improving vascular tone and systemic vascular resistance. In severe amlodipine overdose, experimental models demonstrate methylene blue improves HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP), improving survival rate. With few adverse side effects (green-tinged discoloration of urine, saliva, tears, and bodily fluids), methylene blue should be explored and implemented in the treatment of CCB overdose with refractory hypotension and ARDS.",2021,,"Pellegrini JR, Munshi R, Tiwana MS, Abraham T, Tahir H, Sayedy N, Iqbal J.",https://www.cureus.com/articles/73063-feeling-the-blues-a-case-of-calcium-channel-blocker-overdose-managed-with-methylene-blue.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

PADs may cause congestive heart failure, respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, and renal impairment. Consequently, in some infants, it becomes necessary to attempt closure of the PAD. Surgical closure can be difficult in small infants and is not without its risks; thus, medical closure offers advantages. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors have been used for medical closure of the PAD with both ibuprofen and indomethacin having been used clinically.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify all studies comparing ibuprofen and indomethacin. Studies comparing ibuprofen and indomethacin for closure of the PAD in premature infants were included in the meta-analysis. A subanalysis was performed to compare the route of administration. Efficacy endpoints studied were PAD closure and surgical ligation while adverse effects studied were death in the first month of life, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the first month of life, Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, and change in the serum creatinine after treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen and indomethacin were equally effective in closing the PAD in premature infants and demonstrated no difference in the incidence of adverse events. In respect to the route of administration, oral ibuprofen was as effective as intravenous indomethacin. When comparing both drugs via the intravenous route, the only difference noted between the ibuprofen and indomethacin was that ibuprofen was associated with a lesser increase in serum creatinine after treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen and indomethacin are equally effective in PAD closure without any difference in the incidence of adverse events. Importantly, oral ibuprofen was as effective as intravenous indomethacin.",2015,,"Loomba R, Nijhawan K.",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.274,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,36741676,36741676.0,10.7759/cureus.33320,Fixed Dose Versus Loose Dose: Analgesic Combinations.,"Combinations of drugs may be fixed (two or more entities in a single product) or loose (two or more agents taken together but as individual agents) to help address multimechanistic pain. The use of opioids plus nonopioids can result in lower opioid consumption without sacrificing analgesic benefits. Drug combinations may offer additive or synergistic benefits. A variety of fixed-dose combination products are available on the market such as diclofenac plus thiocolchicoside, acetaminophen and caffeine, acetaminophen and opioid, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, tramadol and acetaminophen, and others. Fixed-dose combination products offer predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, known adverse events, and can reduce the pill burden. However, they are limited to certain drug combinations and doses; loose dosing allows prescribers the versatility to meet individual patient requirements as well as the ability to titrate as needed. Not all drug combinations offer synergistic benefits, which depend on the drugs and their doses. Certain drugs offer dual mechanisms of action in a single molecule, such as tapentadol, and these may further be used in combination with other analgesics. New technology allows for co-crystal productions of analgesic agents which may further improve drug characteristics, such as bioavailability.

The inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) is the most frequently used mandibular injection technique for achieving local anesthesia for endodontic treatment. However, the IANB does not always result in successful pulpal anesthesia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of preoperative administration of both ibuprofen and ketorolac on the efficacy of the IANB in patients with irreversible pulpitis. Methods A total of 60 patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpits of a mandibular posterior tooth randomly received identical capsules of either 400 mg ibuprofen or 20 mg ketorolac or a placebo 1 hour before the administration of a conventional IANB. Access was initiated after profound lip numbness was achieved. Success was defined as no, mild, moderate, or severe pain (verbal rating scale recordings) on accessing the dentin, pulp, and debridement. Results Ketorolac was associated with superior efficacy in pain reduction when compared with ibuprofen and placebo in all parameters, namely the dentin, pulp, and canal debridement.

This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments. The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice. Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated. Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19. These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment. Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated. Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified. Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described. Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed.
