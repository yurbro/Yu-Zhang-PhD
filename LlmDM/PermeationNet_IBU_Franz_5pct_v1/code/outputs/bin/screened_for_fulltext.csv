The use of novel carriers such as microemulsions, vesicles, or nanocarriers might entail various limitations concerning production cost, formulation stability, or active substance capacity. In this paper, we present a novel fumed silica-based organogel as a low-cost, simple preparation drug or cosmetic carrier with interesting rheological properties and high solubilization capacity. The objective of the study was to characterize the utility aspects of the new dermatological base with special emphasis on stability, rheology, and release studies. Various formulations of a silica organogel base with poorly soluble active pharmacological substances such as propolis or ibuprofen were prepared and tested. The studies of thermal stress, enforced syneresis, and long-term stability were performed along with analyses of rheological profiles of alkali-dependent sol-gel transformation and organogel release. The new drug vehicle shows high thermodynamic stability, thixotropic rheology and first-order release profile. Such properties are promising for commercial utility as a dermatologically applied base for poorly soluble substances.",2025,,"Suwiński G, Nowak I.",https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/2/266/pdf?version=1736421780,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",,,IVRT,,yes,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen release kinetics', 'Formulation specifics of the organogel', 'Comparison of permeation rates', 'Data on solubilization capacity']",,0.9,now,yes,yes,"The abstract indicates the use of ibuprofen in a formulation study, focusing on release properties.

The membranes were characterized for various physical and chemical properties using techniques such as FTIR, SEM, AFM, TEM, EDS, and contact angle measurements. The membranes were then evaluated for their efficiency in rejecting EOCs and resistance to protein fouling. TEM micrographs showed uniform distribution of Ag/Pd nanoparticles within the PES matrix, while SEM images showed uniform, fingerlike structures that were not affected by the presence of embedded nanoparticles. The presence of Ag/Pd nanoparticles resulted in rougher membranes. There was an increase in membrane hydrophilicity with increasing nanoparticles loading, which resulted in improved pure water permeability (37−135 Lm2h−1bar−1). The membranes exhibited poor salt rejection (<15%), making them less susceptible to flux decline due to concentration polarization. With a mean pore radius of 2.39−4.70 nm, the membranes effectively removed carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, and naproxen (up to 40%), with size exclusion being the major removal mechanism. Modifying the membranes with Ag/Pd nanoparticles improved their antifouling properties, making them a promising innovation for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater.",2022,,"Patala R, Mahlangu OT, Nyoni H, Mamba BB, Kuvarega AT.",https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes12080762,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",,,uncertain,,yes,synthetic_membrane,"['Measurable endpoints for ibuprofen removal', 'Details on formulation of PES membranes', 'Specific efficiency metrics for ibuprofen', 'Methods of evaluating antifouling properties']",,0.8,now,no,yes,"The study evaluates membranes for ibuprofen removal and mentions formulation details, making it relevant for the dataset."

Polymeric microarray patches (MAPs) are minimally invasive devices that enable systemic delivery of a wide range of drugs by overcoming the outer skin barrier. Conventionally, MAPs fabricated by micromoulding have a low needle density. In this study, the performance of hydrogel-forming MAPs cast using novel industrially manufactured micromoulds with a high needle density (600 needles/0.75 cm<sup>2</sup>) was compared to that of MAPs obtained using conventional moulds with a lower density (196 needles/0.89 cm<sup>2</sup>). Surrounding holders for micromoulds were designed for time-efficient fabrication of MAPs. The influence of needle densities on mechanical strength, insertion efficiency and in vitro permeation of ibuprofen sodium (IBU) was analysed. Insertion of both MAPs into an artificial skin model and neonatal porcine skin was comparable. No significant difference was observed in permeation studies of IBU (<i>p</i> > 0.05), with a delivery of 8.7 ± 1.7 mg for low-density and 9.5 ± 0.1 mg for high-density MAPs within 24 h.

The EOs were prepared using the steam distillation method and their chemical compositions were identified by GC-MS. The corresponding cytotoxicities were evaluated in epidermal keartinocyte HaCaT cell lines by an MTT assay. Furthermore, the percutaneous permeation studies were carried out to compare the permeation enhancement effect of EOs. Then the therapeutic efficacy of ibuprofen with EOs was evaluated using dysmenorrheal model mice. The data supports a decreasing trend of skin cell viability in which Clove oil >Angelica oil > Chuanxiong oil > Cyperus oil > Cinnamon oil >> Azone. Chuanxiong oil and Angelica oil had been proved to possess a significant permeation enhancement for TDD of ibuprofen. More importantly, the pain inhibitory intensity of ibuprofen hydrogel was demonstrated to be greater with Chuanxiong oil when compared to ibuprofen without EOs (p < 0.05). The contents of calcium ion and nitric oxide (NO) were also significantly changed after the addition of Chuanxiong oil (p < 0.05).

Essential Oil-Biological Activity and Enhancement of the Skin Penetration of Drugs-In Vitro Study.,"<i>Epilobium angustifolium</i> L. is a popular medicinal plant found in many regions of the world. This plant contains small amounts of essential oil whose composition and properties have not been extensively investigated. There are few reports in the literature on the antioxidant and antifungal properties of this essential oil and the possibility of applying it as a potential promoter of the skin penetration of drugs. The essential oil was obtained by distillation using a Clavenger type apparatus. The chemical composition was analyzed by the GC-MS method. The major active compounds of <i>E. angustifolium</i> L. essential oil (EOEa) were terpenes, including α-caryophyllene oxide, eucalyptol, β-linalool, camphor, (S)-carvone, and β-caryophyllene. The analyzed essential oil was also characterized by antioxidant activity amounting to 78% RSA (Radical Scavenging Activity). Antifungal activity against the strains <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>A. ochraceus</i>, <i>A. parasiticum</i>, and <i>Penicillium cyclopium</i> was also determined. The largest inhibition zone was observed for strains from the <i>Aspergillus</i> group. The EOEa enhanced the percutaneous penetration of ibuprofen and lidocaine. After a 24 h test, the content of terpene in the skin and the acceptor fluid was examined. It has been shown that the main compounds contained in the essential oil do not penetrate through the skin, but accumulate in it. Additionally, FTIR-ATR analysis showed a disturbance of the <i>stratum corneum</i> (SC) lipids caused by the essential oil application. Due to its rich composition and high biological activity, EOEa may be a potential candidate to be applied, for example, in the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries.

New derivatives of (<i>RS</i>)-2-[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl]propionic acid were synthesized using hydrochlorides of alkyl esters (ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, <i>sec</i>-butyl, <i>tert</i>-butyl, and pentyl) of L-glutamine. These were further transformed into alkyl esters of L-amino acid ibuprofenates through neutralization and protonation reactions.

The research confirmed the ionic structure of the obtained hydrochlorides of alkyl esters of L-amino acids and ibuprofenates of alkyl esters of L-glutamic acid. It revealed significant correlations between ester chain length and thermal stability, crystallinity, phase transition temperatures, lipophilicity, water solubility, skin permeability, and skin accumulation of these compounds. Compared to the parent ibuprofen, the synthesized derivatives exhibited higher water solubility, lower lipophilicity, and enhanced skin permeability.

OMCs' efficiency could be further increased by embedding them into a hydrogel phase for an <i>in loco</i> prolonged drug release. In this work, OMCs were embedded into injectable thermosensitive hydrogels. In detail, rod-like (diameter ca. 250 nm, length ca. 700 nm) and spherical (diameter approximately 120 nm) OMCs were synthesized by nanocasting selected templates and loaded with ibuprofen through a melt infiltration method to achieve complete filling of their pores (100% loading yield). In parallel, an amphiphilic Poloxamer® 407-based poly(ether urethane) was synthesized (Mn¯ 72 kDa) and solubilized at 15 and 20% <i>w/v</i> concentration in saline solution to design thermosensitive hydrogels. OMC incorporation into the hydrogels (10 mg/mL concentration) did not negatively affect their gelation potential. Hybrid systems successfully released ibuprofen at a slower rate compared to control gels (gels embedding ibuprofen as such), but with no significant differences between rod-like and spherical OMC-loaded gels.

Two nanostructured ZnO (NsZnO) with different morphologies were prepared through wet organic-solvent-free processes and characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and nitrogen adsorption analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the two samples against different microbial strains was investigated together with the in vitro Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. The results indicated that the two ZnO nanostructures exhibited the following activity: <i>S. aureus</i> > <i>C. albicans > K. pneumoniae</i>. A correlation between the antimicrobial activity, the physico⁻chemical properties (specific surface area and crystal size) and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion release was found. Ibuprofen was, for the first time, loaded on the NsZnO carriers with a supercritical CO₂-mediated drug impregnation process and in vitro dissolution studies of the loaded drug were performed. A successful loading up to 14% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> of ibuprofen in its amorphous form was obtained.

Injectable hybrid formulations were then developed by dispersing ibuprofen-loaded Cu-MBGs within thermosensitive hydrogels based on a custom-made amphiphilic polyurethane. This procedure showed almost no effects on the gelation potential (gelation at 37 °C within 3-5 min). Cu<sup>2+</sup> and ibuprofen were co-released over time in a sustained manner with a significantly lower burst release compared to MBG particles alone (burst release reduction approx. 85% and 65% for ibuprofen and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, respectively).

However, several factors such as skin, physicochemical properties of the drug, and vehicle characteristics influence the permeation. Within a formulation, critical factors such as concentration of drug, physical state of drug in the formulation, and organoleptic properties affect the flux across the skin. The aim of the study was to develop and investigate topical semisolid preparations (creams and gels) with ibuprofen as the model drug and investigate the effect of various formulation parameters on the in-vitro performance across the Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane using flow-through cells. In addition, the physical stability of the developed formulations was investigated by studying viscosity, pH, and appearance. All the formulations developed in the study had appealing appearance with smooth texture and no signs of separation. Viscosity and pH of the formulations were acceptable. Cumulative amount of drug permeated at the end of 24 h was highest for clear gel (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> ibuprofen; F6: 739.6 ± 36.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>) followed by cream with high concentration of ibuprofen in suspended form (5% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>; F3: 320.8 ± 17.53 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), emulgel (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> ibuprofen; F5: 178.5 ± 34.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and cream with solubilized ibuprofen (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>; F2A: 163.2 ± 9.36 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>). Results from this study showed that permeation of ibuprofen was significantly influenced by formulation parameters such as concentration of ibuprofen (3% vs. 5% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), physical state of ibuprofen (solubilized vs. suspended), formulation type (cream vs. gel), mucoadhesive agents, and viscosity (high vs. low).

The size reduction makes the eutectic formation a viable option to improve the dissolution rate of the poorly soluble APIs. In the present study, ibuprofen, naproxen, and sorafenib were investigated in terms of their phase behaviors with fatty alcohols, such as tetradecanol, octadecanol, and docosanol. Among the studied APIs, only ibuprofen was able to form eutectics with the fatty alcohols, and this was in agreement with the feasibility prediction based on the van 't Hoff equation and solubility parameters. In vitro release behavior was significantly improved for the ibuprofen/octadecanol eutectic mixture, although the practical insolubility of octadecanol in water was the opposite of the outstanding hydrophilicity of usual eutectic formers.

To select safe excipients for nanoemulsion formulation and to discard any haemolytic potential, an in vitro miniaturized test was performed on human whole blood. From haemolysis results obtained on eighteen of the most commonly used excipients, a medium chain triglyceride, a surfactant, and a solubilizer were selected for formulation assays. Based on a design of experiments and a ternary diagram, the feasibility of nanoemulsions was determined. The composition was defined to produce monodisperse nanodroplets with a diameter of either 50 or 120 nm, and their physicochemical properties were optimized to be suitable for intravenous administration. These nanoemulsions, stable over 21 days in storage conditions, were shown to be able to encapsulate with high encapsulation efficiency and high drug loading, up to 16% (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), two water practically insoluble drug models: ibuprofen and fenofibrate.

The objective of this study was to produce taste-masked ibuprofen granules using a novel process, twin-screw melt granulation (TSMG). TSMG is an emerging, high-productivity, continuous process. Granules of ibuprofen embedded in a lipid matrix were produced across a range of process conditions, resulting in a range of output granule particle sizes. The ibuprofen appeared to be miscible with the lipid binder though it recrystallized after processing. The ibuprofen melt granules were tested in simulated saliva using a novel, small-volume dissolution technique with continuous acquisition of the ibuprofen concentration. The ibuprofen release from the granules was slower than the neat API and physical blend, beyond the expected residence time of the granules in the mouth.

These drugs must overcome the skin barrier to cause a therapeutic effect. Human skin has been widely used as a model to study in vitro drug diffusion and permeation, however, it suffers from many limitations. Therefore, to perform in vitro permeation test (IVPT), we used a Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane with diffusion characteristics well-correlated to human skin. This study's objective was to optimize the IVPT conditions using Plackett-Burman experimental design for bio-predictive evaluation of the in vitro permeation rates of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, etofenamate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen) across Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane from commercial topical formulations. The Plackett-Burman factorial design was used to screen the effect of seven factors in eight runs with one additional center point. This tool allowed us to set the sensitive and discriminative IVPT final conditions that can appropriately characterize the NSAIDs formulations.

Ibuprofen, tofacitinib citrate, rhodamine B, and lidocaine were loaded into proposomes. These drug formulations were analyzed for particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, and in vitro skin permeation. The confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on skin treated with calcein and rhodamine B laden proposomes. The transdermal delivery relative to physicochemical properties of drugs such as logP, melting point, molecular weight, solubility, etc., were analyzed. We tested the safety of the proposomes using reconstructed human skin tissue equivalents, which were fabricated in-house. We also used human cadaver skin samples as a control. The proposomes had an average diameter of 128 to 148 nm. The drug's entrapment efficiencies were in the range of 42.9-52.7%, translating into the significant enhancement of drug permeation through the skin. The enhancement ratio was 1.4 to 4.0, and linearly correlated to logP, molecular weight, and melting point. Confocal imaging also showed higher skin permeation of calcein and rhodamine B in proposome than in solution. The proposome was found safe for skin application.

In fact, their extremely high exposed surface area and pore volume allow to load and the release of several drugs, while their framework can be enriched with specific therapeutic ions allowing to boost the tissue regeneration. However, due to the open and easily accessible mesopore structure of MBG, the release of the incorporated therapeutic molecules shows an initial burst effect leading to unsuitable release kinetics. Hence, a still open challenge in the design of drug delivery systems based on MBGs is the control of their release behavior. In this work, Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of polyelectrolyte multi-layers was exploited as a powerful and versatile technique for coating the surface of Cu-substituted MBG nanoparticles with innovative multifunctional drug delivery systems for co-releasing of therapeutic copper ions (exerting pro-angiogenic and anti-bacterial effects) and an anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen). Two different routes were investigated: in the first strategy, chitosan and alginate were assembled by forming the multi-layered surface, and, successively, ibuprofen was loaded by incipient wetness impregnation, while in the second approach, alginate was replaced by ibuprofen, introduced as polyelectrolyte layer. Zeta-potential, TGA and FT-IR spectroscopy were measured after the addition of each polyelectrolyte layer, confirming the occurrence of the stepwise deposition. In addition, the in vitro bioactivity and the ability to modulate the release of the cargo were evaluated. The polyelectrolyte coated-MBGs were proved to retain the peculiar ability to induce hydroxyapatite formation after 7 days of soaking in Simulated Body Fluid.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been utilised to enhance the nanogels' loading ability towards poorly soluble drugs and promote/sustain drug release. However, formation of CD-based nanogels requires the use of specially modified CDs, or of crosslinking agents. The aim of this work was to develop a CD-based nanogel to improve the cutaneous delivery of ibuprofen by using the soluble β-cyclodextrin/epichlorohydrin polymer (EPIβCD) without adding any potentially toxic crosslinker. The use of EPIβCD enabled increasing ibuprofen loading due to its complexing/solubilizing power towards the poorly soluble drug and prolonging drug release over time due to the nanogel formation. DLS analysis proved that EPIβCD allowed the formation of nanostructures ranging from 60 up to 400 nm, depending on the gelling agent type and the gel preparation method. EPIβCD replacement with monomeric HPβCD did not lead in any case to nanogel formation. Permeation experiments using skin-simulating artificial membranes proved that the EPIβCD-based nanogel enhanced ibuprofen solubility and release, increasing its permeation rate up to 3.5 times, compared to a reference formulation without CD and to some commercial gel formulations, and also assured a sustained release. Moreover, EPIβCD replacement with HPβCD led to a marked increase in drug solubility and initial release rate, but did not provide a prolonged release due to the lack of a nano-matrix structure controlling drug diffusion.",2022,,"Cirri M, Nerli G, Mennini N, Maestrelli F, Mura P.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/12/2567/pdf?version=1669189115,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",,,IVRT,,yes,skin,"['Details on formulations used', 'Permeation data statistics', 'Comparative results with reference formulations']",,0.9,now,yes,yes,"The study focuses on a novel ibuprofen delivery system using a cyclodextrin-based nanogel, indicating relevant permeability and formulation information.

Therefore, the present work concerns the synthesis and characterization of hierarchical zeolites with secondary mesoporosity, based on commercial zeolites such as MFI (ZSM-5), BEA (β) and FAU (Y), and modified with polysaccharides such as inulin, hyaluronic acid, and heparin. All materials were characterized by various analytical techniques and applied as a platform for delivery of selected drug molecules. On the basis of X-ray diffraction (presence of reflections in the 2θ angle range of 1.5-2.5°) and low-temperature nitrogen sorption isotherms (mixture of isotherms of I and IV type) additional secondary porosity was found in the mesopore range. Additional tests were also conducted to determine the possibility of loading selected molecules with biological activity into the aforementioned materials and then releasing them in the therapeutic process. Molecules with different therapeutic options were selected for testing, namely ibuprofen, curcumin, and ferulic acid with anti-inflammatory, potentially anticancer, antioxidant, and skin discoloration activities, respectively.

The different small molecular diamines, ethylenediamine, butanediamine, and p-phenylenediamine, were introduced as cross-linking agents to investigate the effect of diamine on the properties of GO membranes. The hydrophobic substances ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and triclosan were selected as target pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The adsorption and molecular sieving activities of PPCPs by cross-linked GO membranes at a pH of 3 were investigated. The permeate water was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm, molecular weight distribution, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. The results showed that the removal of hydrophobic PPCPs by GO membranes was mainly due to their adsorption and molecular sieving activities. Adsorption was mainly determined by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the membranes and PPCPs.

A cost-effective metal alloy used in biomedical implants was chosen as the substrate, and ibuprofen (Ibu), a well-known anti-inflammatory drug, was selected for drug release tests for its widespread availability and accessibility. Multilayer coatings consisting of cellulose acetate (CA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and chitosan (CHI), with or without ibuprofen (Ibu) content, were applied onto medical-grade stainless steel (SS-316 type) through electrospinning, electrospray, or blow spinning. The adhesion of the CA, PCL, and layered CA/PCL membranes, with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 100 μm, to SS substrates varied between 0.15 N and 0.22 N without CHI, which increased to 0.21 and 0.74 N, respectively, when a CHI interlayer was introduced by electrospraying between the SS and the coatings. Although drug release in a simulated body fluid (SBF) medium is predominantly governed by diffusion-driven mechanisms in all single- and multilayer coatings, a delayed release was noted in CA coatings containing Ibu when overlaid with a PCL coating produced by blow spinning. This suggests avenues for further investigations into combinations of multilayer coatings, both with and without drug-imbued layers.",2024,,"Cidade do Carmo C, Brito M, Oliveira JP, Marques A, Ferreira I, Baptista AC.",https://doi.org/10.3390/polym16142006,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",,,uncertain,,yes,skin,"['Details on diffusion cell methods', 'Specifics on ibuprofen release rates', 'Formulation details of coatings used', 'Barrier properties of the coatings']",,0.8,now,no,yes,"The study involves ibuprofen release, indicating a relevant experiment for permeation analysis, and discusses different coating formulations that may impact drug release dynamics."

The purpose of this work was to develop a novel hydrogel film suitable for passive transdermal drug delivery via skin application. Hydrogels were loaded with model drugs (lidocaine hydrochloride (LID), diclofenac sodium (DIC) and ibuprofen (IBU)) via post-loading and in situ loading methods. The effect of loading method and drug physicochemical properties on the material and drug release properties of medicated film samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), swelling studies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), tensile testing, rheometry, and drug release studies. In situ loaded films showed better drug entrapment within the hydrogel network and also better polymer crystallinity. High drug release was observed from all studied formulations. In situ loaded LID had a plasticizing effect on PEO hydrogel, and films showed excellent mechanical properties and prolonged drug release. The drug release mechanism for the majority of medicated PEO hydrogel formulations was determined as both drug diffusion and polymer chain relaxation, which is highly desirable for controlled release formulations.",2017,,"Wong RSH, Dodou K.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/9/7/286/pdf?version=1500542996,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",,,IVRT,,yes,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen release kinetics', 'Comparison with other drug formulations', 'Characterization methods used for drug analysis', 'Specific results for ibuprofen in hydrogels']",,0.9,now,no,yes,"The study focuses on the transdermal delivery of ibuprofen using PEO hydrogels, indicating relevance to permeation studies.

Ibuprofen was linked to 2-hydroxy-propyl methacrylate by an activated ester methodology in a one-pot procedure with a high yield. The resulting material was copolymerized with either 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate or methyl methacrylate (in 1:3 mole ratios) by the free radical polymerization method, utilizing azoisobutyronitrile at 65-70 °C. The characterization of the resulting products by FTIR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, DSC, and elemental analysis confirmed their synthesis successfully. Ibuprofen release from the obtained polymers was preliminarily evaluated at different buffered solutions (pH 1, 7.4, and 10) into dialysis bags to show the capacity of prodrugs to release the drug under hydrolytic conditions. Detection of hydrolysis by UV spectroscopy at selected intervals showed that the drug can be released by selective hydrolysis of the ester bond at the side of the drug moiety. The release profiles indicated that the hydrolytic behavior of polymers is strongly based on the polymer hydrophilicity and the pH value of the hydrolysis solution. The results suggest that these polymers could be useful in controlled release systems.",2013,,"Babazadeh M, Sheidaei M, Abbaspour S, Edjlali L.",https://doi.org/10.3797/scipharm.1204-14,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",,,IVRT,,yes,uncertain,"['specific formulation details of the polymeric prodrugs', 'data on in vitro release rates and methods', 'stability of the drug within the polymer', 'comparison to conventional ibuprofen release methods']",,0.9,now,no,yes,"The study focuses on the in vitro evaluation of ibuprofen release from new polymeric prodrugs, making it relevant to the dataset on ibuprofen permeation.

For topical product assessment, the synthetic membrane should provide no diffusional resistance to drug diffusion, however, different synthetic membranes do show rate-limiting effects. The aims of this study were to validate and minimise errors that occur in Franz cell experiments, to examine the effect of different types of synthetic membrane on drug diffusion and to test the suitability of Franz cell experiments for drug release from a freeze-dried sodium alginate wafer and a sodium alginate gel. Franz cell experimental variables were validated using physical and visual tests, a plasticiser assay and incorporation of tonicity agents. The drug flux from a commercial gel was compared before and after validation. Thirteen types of synthetic membranes were screened using ibuprofen saturated solution. The impact of drug log P on flux was evaluated using ibuprofen (hydrophobic drug), riboflavin (hydrophilic drug) and four parabens of increasing hydrophobicity.

MBG structure and morphology, as well as mesopores size and shape, were investigated by x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. In vitro bioactivity was investigated by soaking MBG membranes in simulated body fluid (SBF) for different time frames. Ibuprofen was encapsulated into MBG pores and drug release kinetics in SBF were assessed. Biological tests by using SAOS-2 cells were performed to assess the material cytocompatibility.<h4>Results</h4>The material revealed significant ability to induce hydroxyapatite formation on its surface (bioactivity). Drug release kinetics in SBF are very similar to those obtained for mesoporous silica having mesopore size comparable to that of the prepared MBG (∼5 nm). No evidence of cell viability depression was detected during in vitro culture, which demonstrates the good biological compatibility of the material.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The easiness of tailoring and shaping, the highly bioactive and biocompatible behavior, and the drug uptake/release ability of the prepared materials may suggest their use as ""smart"" multifunctional grafts for bone reconstructive surgery.",2012,,"Baino F, Fiorilli S, Mortera R, Onida B, Saino E, Visai L, Verné E, Vitale-Brovarone C.",https://doi.org/10.5301/JABFM.2012.9270,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",,,IVRT,,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed drug release kinetics', 'Formulation specifics of ibuprofen in MBG', 'Impact of pore size on drug release', 'Comparative analysis with other drug delivery systems', 'In vitro test conditions for drug release']",,0.9,now,yes,yes,"The study involves encapsulation and release kinetics of ibuprofen from mesoporous bioactive glass, which aligns with the interest in diffusion studies.
