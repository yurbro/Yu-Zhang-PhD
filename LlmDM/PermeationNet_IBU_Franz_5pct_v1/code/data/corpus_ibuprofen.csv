ETH,470960,,,Subcellular actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs : lysosome and prostaglandin studies,"The stabilization of lysosomal membranes and the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis are two of the many proposed mechanisms whereby anti-inflammatory drugs may exert their therapeutic action. In this context, the subcellular actions of certain non-steroidal agents have been investigated using in vitro techniques. Under specific conditions, rat liver lysosomal membranes were stabilized by aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin, flurbiprofen and chloroquine as assessed by the release of free acid phosphatase or beta-glucuronidase. The lysosomal enzymes were not inhibited by the above agents at therapeutic doses. Attempts were made to extend these studies to the inflammatory important lysosomes of polymorphonucelar leucocytes but difficulties were encountered. Although both ibuprofen and flurbiprofen decreased the inflammatory response in adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat, no correlation was observed between paw size and total paw lysosomal levels. Prostaglandin biosynthesis was investigated in preparations of rabbit renal medullae and bovine seminal vesicles using a radiochemical technique. The synthesis of radioactive PGE2 and PGF2alpha from labelled precursor, arachidonic acid, was inhibited by non-steroidal ...

Incubation of ibuprofen with rat skin homogenates in the presence of coenzyme A, ATP, and magnesium provided no evidence for the formation of ibuprofenyl coenzyme A (the initial intermediate in the metabolic inversion of [R]- to [S]-ibuprofen). Similar incubation studies gave no indication of a change in the enantiomeric ratios of ibuprofen over the time course of the experiments. Percutaneous penetration studies of ibuprofen gel through porcine skin indicated that the ibuprofen enantiomer levels in the reservoir solutions were consistent with racemic ibuprofen having traversed the skin with no metabolic inversion. These results suggest that, in the models studied, skin metabolism does not result in the chiral inversion of (R)- to (S)-ibuprofen and that the topical administration of ibuprofen will result in the delivery of 50% ""isomeric ballast.""",1997,,"Millership JS, Collier PS.",https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-636X(1997)9:3<313::AID-CHIR19>3.0.CO;2-Q,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,20393931,20393931,10.1002/14651858.cd001177.pub2,Topical agents or dressings for pain in venous leg ulcers.,"<h4>Background</h4>Venous leg ulcers affect up to 1 per cent of people at some time in their lives. The main treatments are compression bandages and dressings. As these ulcers are often painful some clinicians choose particular dressings and topical treatments (analgesia/ local anaesthetic) to reduce the pain both during and between dressing changes.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effectiveness of dressings, local anaesthetics or topical analgesia for pain relief in venous leg ulceration.<h4>Search strategy</h4>For this update the search strings were revised and the following databases were searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 16/12/09) The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2009; Ovid MEDLINE - 1950 to November Week 3 2009; Ovid EMBASE - 1980 to 2009 Week 50; EBSCO CINAHL - 1982 to December 16 2009. No date or language restrictions were applied.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials which evaluated local interventions used to relieve venous leg ulcer pain were considered. Pain was defined as either persistent pain or pain at dressing changes or debridement. Ulcer healing and reported adverse events were also considered as further outcomes.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Eligibility for inclusion was confirmed by two review authors who independently assessed the potential trials.<h4>Main results</h4>Two trials evaluating interventions for persistent venous leg ulcer pain were identified for this review update. Both studies evaluated ibuprofen slow release foam dressings; one comparing it with local best practice and the other with an identical foam comparator. The primary end point for both studies was ""pain relief achieved"". When compared with a foam dressing alone, there was no evidence of a statistically significant effect of the ibuprofen foam dressing in terms of achieving some pain relief the first evening after treatment: 74% in the ibuprofen group (46/62) had pain relief compared with 58% (35/60) in the foam group (no significant difference: RR 1.27, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.65). In the second study 100% (32/32) of people with venous ulcers achieved some pain relief with the ibuprofen dressing on the first evening of treatment compared with 93% (26/28) in the local best practice group (no significant difference: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21). Pooling these studies in a meta-analysis (using a random effects model as significant heterogeneity present (p=0.1), I(2) = 64%) there is no evidence that ibuprofen dressings increase the pain relief experienced by the first evening of use (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44). We were not able to extract sufficient data to combine other pain outcomes from these trials. There was no difference in healing rates but slightly more adverse events with ibuprofen dressings than with a similar foam dressing without ibuprofen.Six trials evaluated interventions for the pain associated with debridement and were considered sufficiently similar to pool. There was a statistically significant reduction in debridement pain scores with 5% Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream; the difference in means (measured on a 100 mm scale) was 20.6 mm (95% CI 12.19 to 29.11). Of these six trials, only one small trial measured healing as an outcome and found no difference in the numbers of ulcers healed at the end of the study.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is no evidence that ibuprofen dressings offer pain relief, as measured at the first evening of use, to people with painful venous leg ulcers compared with foam dressings or best practice.EMLA appears to provide effective pain relief for venous leg ulcer debridement but the effect (if any) of EMLA on ulcer healing remains unknown.",2010,,"Briggs M, Nelson EA.",https://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/499/1/Topical%20agents%20or%20dressings%20for%20pain%20in%20venous%20leg%20ulcers.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,23152206,23152206,10.1002/14651858.cd001177.pub3,Topical agents or dressings for pain in venous leg ulcers.,"<h4>Background</h4>Venous leg ulcers affect up to 1% of people at some time in their lives and are often painful. The main treatments are compression bandages and dressings. Topical treatments to reduce pain during and between dressing changes are sometimes used.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the effects of topical agents or dressings for pain in venous leg ulcers.<h4>Search methods</h4>For this third update the following databases were searched: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 9 May 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (2009 to April Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations May 08, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2009 to 2012 Week 18); and EBSCO CINAHL (2009 to May 2 2012). No date or language restrictions were applied.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of topical agents or dressing for the treatment of pain in venous ulcers were included.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently performed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment.<h4>Main results</h4>Six trials (343 participants) evaluated Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream for the pain associated with ulcer debridement. The between-group difference in pain measured on a 100 mm scale was statistically significant in favour of EMLA (MD -20.65, 95% CI -12.19 to -29.11). No significant between-group differences in burning or itching were observed.Two trials (470 participants with venous leg ulcers) evaluated ibuprofen slow-release foam dressings for persistent venous leg ulcer pain. Compared with local best practice, significantly more participants in the ibuprofen dressing group achieved the outcome of >50% of the total maximum pain relief score between day 1 and day 5 than participants in the local best practice group (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.15). The number needed to treat was 6 (95% CI 4 to 12). In the second trial, compared with an identical non-ibuprofen foam dressing, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing slight to complete pain relief on the first evening of treatment.Limited data were available to assess healing rates or adverse events.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. EMLA (5%) appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers. Further research should consider standardised pain assessment methods and assess both the effect on ulcer healing and the impact of long term use of these treatments.",2012,,"Briggs M, Nelson EA, Martyn-St James M.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001177.pub3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,19588326,19588326,10.1002/14651858.cd001548.pub2,Single dose oral ibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults.,"<h4>Background</h4>This review updates a 1999 Cochrane review showing that ibuprofen at various doses was effective in postoperative pain in single dose studies designed to demonstrate analgesic efficacy. New studies have since been published. Ibuprofen is one of the most widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) analgesics both by prescription and as an over-the-counter medicine. Ibuprofen is used for acute and chronic painful conditions.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess analgesic efficacy of ibuprofen in single oral doses for moderate and severe postoperative pain in adults.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to May 2009.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ibuprofen (any formulation) in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected.<h4>Main results</h4>Seventy-two studies compared ibuprofen and placebo (9186 participants). Studies were predominantly of high reporting quality, and the bulk of the information concerned ibuprofen 200 mg and 400 mg. For at least 50% pain relief compared with placebo the NNT for ibuprofen 200 mg (2690 participants) was 2.7 (2.5 to 3.0) and for ibuprofen 400 mg (6475 participants) it was 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6). The proportion with at least 50% pain relief was 46% with 200 mg and 54% with 400 mg. Remedication within 6 hours was less frequent with higher doses, with 48% remedicating with 200 mg and 42% with 400 mg. The median time to remedication was 4.7 hours with 200 mg and 5.4 hours with 400 mg. Sensitivity analysis indicated that pain model and ibuprofen formulation may both affect the result, with dental impaction models and soluble ibuprofen salts producing better efficacy estimates. Adverse events were uncommon, and not different from placebo.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>The very substantial amount of high quality evidence demonstrates that ibuprofen is an effective analgesic in treating postoperative pain. NNTs for 200 mg and 400 mg ibuprofen did not change significantly from the previous review even when a substantial amount of new information was added. New information is provided on remedication.",2009,,"Derry C, Derry S, Moore RA, McQuay HJ.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001548.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,29182798,29182798,10.1002/14651858.cd003976.pub2,Pharmacological interventions for pain relief during orthodontic treatment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pain is a common side effect of orthodontic treatment. It increases in proportion to the amount of force applied to the teeth, and the type of orthodontic appliance used can affect the intensity of the pain. Pain during orthodontic treatment has been shown to be the most common reason for people wanting to discontinue treatment, and has been ranked as the worst aspect of treatment. Although pharmacological methods of pain relief have been investigated, there remains some uncertainty among orthodontists about which painkillers are most suitable and whether pre-emptive analgesia is beneficial. We conducted this Cochrane Review to assess and summarize the international evidence relating to the effectiveness of analgesics for preventing this unwanted side effect associated with orthodontic treatment.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objectives of this review are to determine:- the effectiveness of drug interventions for pain relief during orthodontic treatment; and- whether there is a difference in the analgesic effect provided by different types, forms and doses of analgesia taken during orthodontic treatment.<h4>Search methods</h4>Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 19 June 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 June 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to 19 June 2017) and CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 19 June 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched on the 19 June 2017 for ongoing studies. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relating to pain control during orthodontic treatment. Pain could be measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating scale (NRS) or categorical scale.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently screened the search results, agreed the studies to be included and extracted information from the included studies regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, harms and results. We planned to resolve any discrepancies or disagreements through discussion. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the studies.<h4>Main results</h4>We identified 32 relevant RCTs, which included 3110 participants aged 9 to 34 years, 2348 of whom we were able to include in our analyses. Seventeen of the studies had more than two arms. We were able to use data from 12 trials in meta-analyses that compared analgesics versus control (no treatment or a placebo); nine that compared non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) versus paracetamol; and two that compared pre-emptive versus post-treatment ibuprofen for pain control following orthodontic treatment. One study provided data for the comparison of NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic.We found moderate-quality evidence that analgesics effectively reduced pain following orthodontic treatment when compared to no treatment or a placebo at 2 hours (mean difference (MD) -11.66 mm on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.15 to -7.17; 10 studies, 685 participants), 6 hours (MD -24.27 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -31.44 to -17.11; 9 studies, 535 participants) and 24 hours (MD -21.19 mm on a VAS, 95% CI -28.31 to -14.06; 12 studies, 1012 participants).We did not find any evidence of a difference in efficacy between NSAID and paracetamol at 2, 6 or 24 hours (at 24 hours: MD -0.51, 95% CI -8.93 to 7.92; 9 studies, 734 participants; low-quality evidence).Very low-quality evidence suggested pre-emptive ibuprofen gave better pain relief at 2 hours than ibuprofen taken post treatment (MD -11.30, 95% CI -16.27 to -6.33; one study, 41 participants), however, the difference was no longer significant at 6 or 24 hours.A single study of 48 participants compared topical NSAIDs versus local anaesthetic and showed no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the interventions (very low-quality evidence).Use of rescue analgesia was poorly reported. The very low-quality evidence did not show evidence of a difference between participants taking ibuprofen and participants taking paracetamol (relative risk (RR) 1.5, 95% CI 0.6 to 3.6). Nor did we find evidence of a difference between groups in likelihood of requiring rescue analgesia when ibuprofen was taken pre-emptively compared to after treatment (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.9).Adverse effects were identified in one study, with one participant developing a rash that required treatment with antihistamines. This was provisionally diagnosed as a hypersensitivity to paracetamol.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Analgesics are more effective at reducing pain following orthodontic treatment than placebo or no treatment. Low-quality evidence did not show a difference in effectiveness between systemic NSAIDs compared with paracetamol, or topical NSAIDs compared with local anaesthetic. More high-quality research is needed to investigate these comparisons, and to evaluate pre-emptive versus post-treatment administration of analgesics.",2017,,"Monk AB, Harrison JE, Harrison JE, Worthington HV, Teague A.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003976.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,15654705,15654705,10.1002/14651858.cd005115,Rofecoxib for osteoarthritis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Editor's note: The anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market at the end of September 2004 after it was shown that long-term use (greater than 18 months) could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Further information is available at www.vioxx.com. Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease of the joints, characterised by joint pain, stiffness and loss of physical function. Its onset is age-related and occurs usually between the ages of 50 and 60. It is the commonest cause of disability in those aged over 65, with OA of the knee and/or hip affecting over 20 per cent of the elderly population.<h4>Objectives</h4>To establish the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in the management of OA by systematic review of available evidence.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We searched the following databases up to August 2004: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Research Register, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database. The bibliographies of retrieved papers and content experts were consulted for additional references.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. No unpublished RCTs were included in this edition of the review.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. A validated checklist was used to score the quality of the RCTs. Comparable trials were pooled using fixed effects model.<h4>Main results</h4>Twenty-six RCTs were included. The comparators were placebo, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, nimesulide, nabumetone, paracetamol, celecoxib and Arthrotec. The evidence reviewed indicated that rofecoxib was more effective than placebo (patient global response RR 1.75 95% CI: 1.35, 2.26) but was associated with more adverse events (RR 1.32 95% CI 1.11, 1.56). There were no consistent differences in efficacy between rofecoxib and any of the active comparators at equivalent doses. Endoscopic studies indicated that compared to ibuprofen 800 mg three times a day, rofecoxib caused fewer erosions and gastric ulcers at doses of 25mg and 50mg; the difference in duodenal ulcers was evident only at a dose of 25mg. Rofecoxib 50mg also caused more endoscopically observed ulcers greater than rofecoxib 25mg (RR 2.48 CI: 1.21, 5.11). Very few of the trials reported overall rates of GI adverse events although rofecoxib was found to cause fewer GI events than naproxen. Only one of the nine trials comparing rofecoxib to celecoxib reported on the overall rates of GI events and this was a comparison of the higher recommended dose of rofecoxib with the lower recommended dose of celecoxib. Similarly, the three trials in older hypertensive patients that examined the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib used non-comparable doses; the results of these studies indicated that rofecoxib caused more patients to have oedema and a clinically significant increase in systolic blood pressure. This difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib was not evident in studies conducted in more general populations.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in October 2004 therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use. There remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with Cox II selective agents and further work is ongoing.",2005,,"Garner SE, Fidan DD, Frankish R, Maxwell L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8864971,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, have been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual bleeding and pain in women without IUDs.<h4>Objectives</h4>This review summarizes all randomized controlled trials studying use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of bleeding or pain associated with IUD use. Trials of prophylactic use of these drugs around the time of IUD insertion were also included.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We performed searches of PubMed, CENTRAL, POPLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL for relevant trials. We also wrote to the authors of all trials identified to seek other published or unpublished trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included all randomized controlled trials in any language that tested one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment or prevention of bleeding or pain associated with IUD insertion or use.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two authors independently abstracted data from relevant trials, and we entered data into RevMan for analysis.<h4>Main results</h4>We found 15 trials from 10 countries; the total number of participants was 2702. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, suprofen, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, flufenamic acid, alclofenac, and diclofenac) were effective in reducing menstrual blood loss associated with IUD use. This held true for women with and without complaints of heavy bleeding. Similarly, these drugs were effective in reducing pain associated with IUD use. In contrast, prophylactic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had mixed results; studies with ibuprofen found no effect on pain after insertion on IUD discontinuation. No important differences emerged in the one trial comparing the effect of different NSAIDs on bleeding.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce bleeding and pain associated with IUD use. NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if NSAIDs are ineffective, tranexamic acid may be considered as second-line therapy.

MED,36017945,36017945,10.1002/14651858.cd006034.pub3,Interventions to prevent or treat heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with intrauterine-device use.,"<h4>Background</h4>Heavy menstrual bleeding and pain are common reasons women discontinue intrauterine device (IUD) use. Copper IUD (Cu IUD) users tend to experience increased menstrual bleeding, whereas levonorgestrel IUD (LNG IUD) users tend to have irregular menstruation. Medical therapies used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with Cu and LNG IUD use include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-fibrinolytics and paracetamol. We analysed treatment and prevention interventions separately because the expected outcomes for treatment and prevention interventions differ. We did not combine different drug classes in the analysis as they have different mechanisms of action. This is an update of a review originally on NSAIDs. The review scope has been widened to include all interventions for treatment or prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with IUD use.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have assessed strategies for treatment and prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with IUD use, for example, pharmacotherapy and alternative therapies.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to January 2021.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs in any language that tested strategies for treatment or prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding or pain associated with IUD (Cu IUD, LNG IUD or other IUD) use. The comparison could be no intervention, placebo or another active intervention.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, and extracted data. Primary outcomes were volume of menstrual blood loss, duration of menstruation and painful menstruation. We used a random-effects model in all meta-analyses. Review authors assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.<h4>Main results</h4>This review includes 21 trials involving 3689 participants from middle- and high-income countries. Women were 18 to 45 years old and either already using an IUD or had just had one placed for contraception. The included trials examined NSAIDs and other interventions. Eleven were treatment trials, of these seven were on users of the Cu IUD, one on LNG IUD and three on an unknown type. Ten were prevention trials, six focused on Cu IUD users, and four on LNG IUD users. Sixteen trials had high risk of detection bias due to subjective assessment of pain and bleeding. Treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding Cu IUD Vitamin B1 resulted in fewer pads used per day (mean difference (MD) -7.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.50 to -5.50) and fewer bleeding days (MD -2.00, 95% CI -2.38 to -1.62; 1 trial; 110 women; low-certainty evidence) compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of naproxen on the volume of menstruation compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.78; 1 trial, 40 women; very low-certainty evidence). Treatment with mefenamic acid resulted in less volume of blood loss compared to tranexamic acid (MD -64.26, 95% CI -105.65 to -22.87; 1 trial, 94 women; low-certainty evidence). However, there was no difference in duration of bleeding with treatment of mefenamic acid or tranexamic acid (MD 0.08 days, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.42, 2 trials, 152 women; low-certainty evidence). LNG IUD The use of ulipristal acetate in LNG IUD may not reduce the number of bleeding days in 90 days in comparison to placebo (MD -9.30 days, 95% CI -26.76 to 8.16; 1 trial, 24 women; low-certainty evidence). Unknown IUD type Mefenamic acid may not reduce volume of bleeding compared to Vitex agnus measured by pictorial blood assessment chart (MD -2.40, 95% CI -13.77 to 8.97; 1 trial; 84 women; low-certainty evidence). Treatment of pain Cu IUD Treatment with tranexamic acid and sodium diclofenac may result in little or no difference in the occurrence of pain (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 17.25; 1 trial, 38 women; very low-certainty evidence). Unknown IUD type Naproxen may reduce pain (MD 4.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 7.29; 1 trial, 33 women; low-certainty evidence). Prevention of heavy menstrual bleeding Cu IUD We found very low-certainty evidence that tolfenamic acid may prevent heavy bleeding compared to placebo (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85; 1 trial, 310 women). There was no difference between ibuprofen and placebo in blood volume reduction (MD -14.11, 95% CI -36.04 to 7.82) and duration of bleeding (MD -0.2 days, 95% CI -1.40 to 1.0; 1 trial, 28 women, low-certainty evidence). Aspirin may not prevent heavy bleeding in comparison to paracetamol (MD -0.30, 95% CI -26.16 to 25.56; 1 trial, 20 women; very low-certainty evidence). LNG IUD Ulipristal acetate may increase the percentage of bleeding days compared to placebo (MD 9.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 17.52; 1 trial, 118 women; low-certainty evidence). There were insufficient data for analysis in a single trial comparing mifepristone and vitamin B. There were insufficient data for analysis in the single trial comparing tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid and in another trial comparing naproxen with estradiol. Prevention of pain Cu IUD There was low-certainty evidence that tolfenamic acid may not be effective to prevent painful menstruation compared to placebo (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.14; 1 trial, 310 women). Ibuprofen may not reduce menstrual cramps compared to placebo (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 8.95; 1 trial, 20 women, low-certainty evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Findings from this review should be interpreted with caution due to low- and very low-certainty evidence.

Dexketoprofen is the (S)-enantiomer, which is believed to confer analgesia. Theoretically dexketoprofen is expected to provide equivalent analgesia to ketoprofen at half the dose, with a consequent reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess efficacy, duration of action, and associated adverse events of single dose oral ketoprofen and dexketoprofen in acute postoperative pain in adults.<h4>Search strategy</h4>We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to August 2009.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ketoprofen and dexketoprofen in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was collected.<h4>Main results</h4>Fourteen studies compared ketoprofen (968 participants) at mainly 25 mg and 50 mg with placebo (520 participants). Seven studies compared dexketoprofen (681 participants) at mainly 10 mg to 25 mg with placebo (289 participants). Studies were of adequate reporting quality, and participants had pain following dental, orthopaedic, obstetric, gynaecological and general surgery. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity between studies in dental and other types of surgery, particularly bunionectomy, which limited analysis.Ketoprofen at doses between 12.5 mg and 100 mg produced NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours of 2.4 to 3.3. For dental studies only there was a trend to more efficacy at higher doses, with NNT decreasing from 2.4 at 12.5 mg to 1.6 at 100 mg. Dexketoprofen at doses of 10/12.5 mg and 20/25 mg produced NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours of 3.2 and 3.6, with no obvious dose response. Significantly fewer participants used rescue medication with ketoprofen and dexketoprofen than placebo. The median time to remedication was about 5 hours with ketoprofen and 4 hours with dexketoprofen. The expected equivalent efficacy with a half dose of dexketoprofen compared to ketoprofen was not demonstrated.Adverse events were uncommon with both drugs, and not significantly different from placebo.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Ketoprofen at doses of 25 mg to 100 mg is an effective analgesic in moderate to severe acute postoperative pain with an NNT for at least 50% pain relief of 3.3 with a 50 mg dose. This is similar to that of commonly used NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (NNT 2.5 for 400 mg dose) and diclofenac (NNT 2.7 at 50 mg dose). Duration of action is about 5 hours. Dexketoprofen is also effective with NNTs of 3.2 to 3.6 in the dose range 10 mg to 25 mg. Both drugs were well tolerated in single doses.",2009,,"Barden J, Derry S, McQuay HJ, Moore RA.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4171124?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ketoprofen is a non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat acute and chronic painful conditions. Dexketoprofen is the (S)-enantiomer, which is believed to confer analgesia. Theoretically dexketoprofen is expected to provide equivalent analgesia to ketoprofen at half the dose, with a consequent reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events. This review is one of a series on oral analgesics for acute postoperative pain. Individual reviews have been brought together in two overviews to provide information about the relative efficacy and harm of the different interventions.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the efficacy and safety of single dose oral ketoprofen and oral dexketoprofen compared with placebo for acute postoperative pain, using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in the same way, and criteria of efficacy recommended by an in-depth study at the individual patient level.<h4>Search methods</h4>For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from 2009 to 28 March 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and two online clinical trial registries.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ketoprofen or dexketoprofen in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently considered studies for inclusion in the review, examined issues of study quality and potential bias, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ketoprofen and dexketoprofen, compared with placebo, where there were sufficient data. We collected information on the number of participants with at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over six hours, the median time to use of rescue medication, and the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication. We also collected information on adverse events and withdrawals. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE, and created 'Summary of findings' tables.<h4>Main results</h4>This updated review included 24 studies; six additional studies added 1001 participants involved in comparisons of ketoprofen or dexketoprofen and placebo, with a 12% increase in participants taking ketoprofen and a 65% increase for dexketoprofen. Most participants (70%) were women. Dental studies typically involved young participants (mean age 20 to 30 years); other types of surgery involved older participants (mean age 37 to 68 years). Overall, we judged the studies at high risk of bias only for small size, which can lead to an overestimation of benefit.Ketoprofen doses ranged between 6.5 mg and 150 mg. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with the usual ketoprofen oral dose of 50 mg was 57%, compared to 23% with placebo, giving an NNT of 2.9 (95% CI 2.4 to 3.7) (RR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1; 594 participants; 8 studies; high quality evidence). Efficacy was significantly better in dental studies (NNT 1.8) than other surgery (NNT 4.2). The proportion of participants using rescue medication within six hours was lower with ketoprofen (32%) than with placebo (75%), giving a number needed to treat to prevent use of rescue medication (NNTp) of 2.3 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.1); 263 participants; 4 studies; high quality evidence). Median time to remedication estimates were poorly reported. Reports of any adverse event were similar with ketoprofen (18%) and placebo (11%) (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.8; 342 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events (very low quality evidence).Dexketoprofen doses ranged between 5 mg and 100 mg. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with the usual dexketoprofen oral dose of 20 mg or 25 mg was 52%, compared to 27% with placebo, giving an NNT of 4.1 (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2) (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2; 1177 participants; 8 studies; high quality evidence). Efficacy was significantly better in dental studies (NNT 2.7) than other surgery (NNT 5.7). The proportion of participants using rescue medication within six hours was lower with dexketoprofen (47%) than placebo (69%), giving an NNTp of 4.7 (95% CI 3.3 to 8.0); 445 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). Median time to remedication estimates were poorly reported. Reports of any adverse event were similar with dexketoprofen (14%) and placebo (10%) (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.2; 536 participants, 6 studies; high quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events (very low quality evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Ketoprofen at doses of 25 mg to 100 mg is an effective analgesic in moderate to severe acute postoperative pain with an NNT for at least 50% pain relief of 2.9 with a 50 mg dose. This is similar to that of commonly used NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (NNT 2.5 for 400 mg dose) and diclofenac (NNT 2.7 for 50 mg dose). Dexketoprofen is also effective with an NNT of 4.1 in the dose range 10 mg to 25 mg. Differential efficacy between dental surgery and other types of surgery seen for both drugs is unusual. Both drugs were well tolerated in single doses.",2017,,"Gaskell H, Derry S, Wiffen PJ, Moore RA.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007355.pub3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,23543560,23543560,10.1002/14651858.cd008088.pub3,Anti-TNF-α treatment for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Endometriosis is a chronic, recurring condition that can develop during the reproductive years. It is characterised by the development of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is the most common cause of pelvic pain in women. This endometrial tissue development is dependent on oestrogen produced primarily by the ovaries and, therefore, traditional management has focused on suppression of ovarian function. Mounting evidence shows that altered immune function plays a crucial role in the genesis and development of endometriosis. In this review we considered modulation of the inflammation as an alternative approach.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the effectiveness and safety of anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) treatment in the management of endometriosis in premenopausal women.<h4>Search methods</h4>For the first publication of this review, we searched for trials in the following databases (from their inception to August 2009): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. In addition, we searched all reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field in an attempt to locate trials. We reran this search to 3 September 2012 for this update.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-TNF-α drugs with placebo, no treatment, medical treatment, or surgery for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis were included.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using data extraction forms. The domains assessed for risk of bias were sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. We used risk ratios (RR) for reporting dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI), whilst we expressed continuous data as mean differences (MD). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic.<h4>Main results</h4>Only one trial involving 21 participants was included. The results showed no evidence of an effect of infliximab, one of the known anti-TNF-α drugs, on pelvic pain reduction using the Biberoglu-Behrman (BB) score (0 to 3 scale) for participants (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.15), the BB score for clinicians (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.11), or a visual analogue pain score (VAS, 100 mm scale) (MD -5.60, 95% CI -16.10 to 4.90), or on the use of pain killers (ibuprofen, g/day) (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.10). There was no evidence of an increase in adverse events in the infliximab group compared with placebo (RR 3.73, 95% CI 0.22 to 63.66). We found no evidence of clinical benefits of infliximab for endometriotic lesions, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, or pelvic tenderness. To date, there is no trial that has reported a cost-effectiveness analysis of anti-TNF-α drugs, or the odds of recurrence.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>This review was updated in 2012. The results of the original review published in 2010 remain unchanged. There is still not enough evidence to support the use of anti-TNF-α drugs in the management of women with endometriosis for the relief of pelvic pain.",2013,,"Lu D, Song H, Shi G.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008088.pub3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,24174375,24174375,10.1002/14651858.cd009572.pub2,Combined and alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen therapy for febrile children.,"<h4>Background</h4>Health professionals frequently recommend fever treatment regimens for children that either combine paracetamol and ibuprofen or alternate them. However, there is uncertainty about whether these regimens are better than the use of single agents, and about the adverse effect profile of combination regimens.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effects and side effects of combining paracetamol and ibuprofen, or alternating them on consecutive treatments, compared with monotherapy for treating fever in children.<h4>Search methods</h4>In September 2013, we searched Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2009-2011).<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized controlled trials comparing alternating or combined paracetamol and ibuprofen regimens with monotherapy in children with fever.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>One review author and two assistants independently screened the searches and applied inclusion criteria. Two authors assessed risk of bias and graded the evidence independently. We conducted separate analyses for different comparison groups (combined therapy versus monotherapy, alternating therapy versus monotherapy, combined therapy versus alternating therapy).<h4>Main results</h4>Six studies, enrolling 915 participants, are included.Compared to giving a single antipyretic alone, giving combined paracetamol and ibuprofen to febrile children can result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after treatment (MD -0.27 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08, two trials, 163 participants, moderate quality evidence). If no further antipyretics are given, combined treatment probably also results in a lower mean temperature at four hours (MD -0.70 °Celsius, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.35, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence), and in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for at least four hours after treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.42, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence). Only one trial assessed a measure of child discomfort (fever associated symptoms at 24 hours and 48 hours), but did not find a significant difference in this measure between the treatment regimens (one trial, 156 participants, evidence quality not graded).In practice, caregivers are often advised to initially give a single agent (paracetamol or ibuprofen), and then give a further dose of the alternative if the child's fever fails to resolve or recurs. Giving alternating treatment in this way may result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after the second dose (MD -0.60 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.26, two trials, 78 participants, low quality evidence), and may also result in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for up to three hours after it is given (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55, two trials, 109 participants, low quality evidence). One trial assessed child discomfort (mean pain scores at 24, 48 and 72 hours), finding that these mean scores were lower, with alternating therapy, despite fewer doses of antipyretic being given overall (one trial, 480 participants, low quality evidence)Only one small trial compared alternating therapy with combined therapy. No statistically significant differences were seen in mean temperature, or the number of febrile children at one, four or six hours (one trial, 40 participants, very low quality evidence).There were no serious adverse events in the trials that were directly attributed to the medications used.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is some evidence that both alternating and combined antipyretic therapy may be more effective at reducing temperatures than monotherapy alone. However, the evidence for improvements in measures of child discomfort remains inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence to know which of combined or alternating therapy might be more beneficial.Future research needs to measure child discomfort using standardized tools, and assess the safety of combined and alternating antipyretic therapy.",2013,,"Wong T, Stang AS, Ganshorn H, Hartling L, Maconochie IK, Thomsen AM, Johnson DW.",https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009572.pub2/pdf/full,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,28653390,28653390,10.1002/14651858.cd009761.pub2,Interventions for preventing high altitude illness: Part 1. Commonly-used classes of drugs.,"<h4>Background</h4>High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (8202 feet). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly-used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus-based and free-text terms to search.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized-controlled and cross-over trials conducted in any setting where commonly-used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty-four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly-used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants)The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I<sup>2</sup> = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants)Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants)For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Our assessment of the most commonly-used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.",2017,,"Nieto Estrada VH, Molano Franco D, Medina RD, Gonzalez Garay AG, Martí-Carvajal AJ, Arevalo-Rodriguez I.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6481751?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A PDA can be treated surgically; or medically with one of two prostaglandin inhibitors, indomethacin or ibuprofen. Case reports suggest that paracetamol may be an alternative for the closure of a PDA. An association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to paracetamol and later development of autism or autism spectrum disorder has been reported.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the effectiveness and safety of intravenous or oral paracetamol compared with placebo or no intervention, intravenous indomethacin, intravenous or oral ibuprofen, or with other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors for treatment of an echocardiographically diagnosed PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 6 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 6 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 6 November 2017). We searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs in which paracetamol was compared to no intervention, placebo or other agents used for closure of PDA irrespective of dose, duration and mode of administration in preterm (≤ 34 weeks' postmenstrual age) infants. We both reviewed the search results and made a final selection of potentially eligible articles by discussion. We included studies of both prophylactic and therapeutic use of paracetamol.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for the following outcomes when data were available: failure of ductal closure after the first course of treatment; neurodevelopmental impairment; all-cause mortality during initial hospital stay (death); gastrointestinal bleed or stools positive for occult blood; and serum levels of creatinine after treatment (µmol/L).<h4>Main results</h4>We included eight studies that reported on 916 infants. One of these studies compared paracetamol to both ibuprofen and indomethacin. Five studies compared treatment of PDA with paracetamol versus ibuprofen and enrolled 559 infants. There was no significant difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for failure of ductal closure after the first course of drug administration (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.21; typical risk difference (RD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09); I² = 0% for RR and RD; moderate quality of evidence. Four studies (n = 537) reported on gastrointestinal bleed which was lower in the paracetamol group versus the ibuprofen group (typical RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.69; typical RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.02); I² = 0% for RR and RD; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 17 (95% CI 11 to 50); moderate quality of evidence. The serum levels of creatinine were lower in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group in four studies (moderate quality of evidence), as were serum bilirubin levels following treatment in two studies (n = 290). Platelet counts and daily urine output were higher in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group. One study reported on long-term follow-up to 18 to 24 months of age following treatment with paracetamol versus ibuprofen. There were no significant differences in the neurological outcomes at 18 to 24 months (n = 61); (low quality of evidence).Two studies compared prophylactic administration of paracetamol for a PDA with placebo or no intervention in 80 infants. Paracetamol resulted in a lower rate of failure of ductal closure after 4 to 5 days of treatment compared to placebo or no intervention which was of borderline significance for typical RR 0.49 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.00; P = 0.05); but significant for typical RD -0.21 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.02); I² = 0 % for RR and RD; NNTB 5 (95% CI 2 to 50); (low quality of evidence).Two studies (n = 277) compared paracetamol with indomethacin. There was no significant difference in the failure to close a PDA (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.65; I² = 11%; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.08; I² = 17%) (low quality of evidence). Serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in the paracetamol group compared with the indomethacin group and platelet counts and daily urine output were significantly higher in the paracetamol group.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Moderate-quality evidence according to GRADE suggests that paracetamol is as effective as ibuprofen; low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol to be more effective than placebo or no intervention; and low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA. There was no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome in children exposed to paracetamol compared to ibuprofen; however the quality of evidence is low and comes from only one study. In view of concerns raised regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal and postnatal exposure to paracetamol, long-term follow-up to at least 18 to 24 months' postnatal age must be incorporated in any studies of paracetamol in the newborn population. At least 19 ongoing trials have been registered. Such trials are required before any recommendations for the possible routine use of paracetamol in the newborn population can be made.",2018,,"Ohlsson A, Shah PS.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6494526?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

There was no significant difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for failure of ductal closure after the first course of drug administration (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.21; typical risk difference (RD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09); I² = 0% for RR and RD; moderate quality of evidence. Four studies (n = 537) reported on gastrointestinal bleed which was lower in the paracetamol group versus the ibuprofen group (typical RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.69; typical RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.02); I² = 0% for RR and RD; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 17 (95% CI 11 to 50); moderate quality of evidence. The serum levels of creatinine were lower in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group in four studies (moderate quality of evidence), as were serum bilirubin levels following treatment in two studies (n = 290). Platelet counts and daily urine output were higher in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group. One study reported on long-term follow-up to 18 to 24 months of age following treatment with paracetamol versus ibuprofen. There were no significant differences in the neurological outcomes at 18 to 24 months (n = 61); (low quality of evidence). Two studies compared prophylactic administration of paracetamol for a PDA with placebo or no intervention in 80 infants. Paracetamol resulted in a lower rate of failure of ductal closure after 4 to 5 days of treatment compared to placebo or no intervention which was of borderline significance for typical RR 0.49 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.00; P = 0.05); but significant for typical RD -0.21 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.02); I² = 0 % for RR and RD; NNTB 5 (95% CI 2 to 50); (low quality of evidence). Two studies (n = 277) compared paracetamol with indomethacin. There was no significant difference in the failure to close a PDA (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.65; I² = 11%; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.08; I² = 17%) (low quality of evidence). Serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in the paracetamol group compared with the indomethacin group and platelet counts and daily urine output were significantly higher in the paracetamol group.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Moderate-quality evidence according to GRADE suggests that paracetamol is as effective as ibuprofen; low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol to be more effective than placebo or no intervention; and low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA. There was no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome in children exposed to paracetamol compared to ibuprofen; however the quality of evidence is low and comes from only one study. In view of concerns raised regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal and postnatal exposure to paracetamol, long-term follow-up to at least 18 to 24 months' postnatal age must be incorporated in any studies of paracetamol in the newborn population. At least 19 ongoing trials have been registered. Such trials are required before any recommendations for the possible routine use of paracetamol in the newborn population can be made.",2020,,"Ohlsson A, Shah PS.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010061.pub4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have suggested that paracetamol may be an effective and safe agent for the closure of a PDA.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the efficacy and safety of paracetamol as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy via any route of administration, compared with placebo, no intervention, or another prostaglandin inhibitor, for prophylaxis or treatment of an echocardiographically-diagnosed PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trials registers on 13 October 2021, and one other database on 1 March 2022. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs in which paracetamol (single-agent or combination therapy) was compared to no intervention, placebo, or other agents used for closure of PDA, irrespective of dose, duration, and mode of administration in preterm infants. Two independent authors reviewed the search results and made a final selection of potentially eligible articles through discussion.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: failure of ductal closure after the first course of treatment; all-cause mortality during initial hospital stay; and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).<h4>Main results</h4>For this update, we included 27 studies enrolling 2278 infants. We considered the overall risk of bias in the 27 studies to vary from low to unclear. We identified 24 ongoing studies. Paracetamol versus ibuprofen There was probably little to no difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for failure of ductal closure after the first course (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.18; 18 studies, 1535 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was likely little to no difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.48; 8 studies, 734 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and for NEC (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.94; 10 studies, 1015 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Paracetamol versus indomethacin There was little to no difference between paracetamol and indomethacin for failure of ductal closure after the first course (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.33; 4 studies, 380 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between paracetamol and indomethacin for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.92; 2 studies, 114 infants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of NEC may be lower in the paracetamol group (3.7%) versus the indomethacin group(9.2%) (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96; 4 studies, 384 infants; low-certainty evidence). Prophylactic paracetamol versus placebo/no intervention Prophylactic paracetamol (17%) compared to placebo/no intervention (61%) may reduce failure of ductal closure after one course (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42; 3 studies, 240 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between prophylactic paracetamol and placebo/no intervention for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.44; 3 studies, 240 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on NEC. Early paracetamol treatment versus placebo/no intervention Early paracetamol treatment (28%) compared to placebo/no intervention (79%) may reduce failure of ductal closure after one course when used before 14 days' postnatal age (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53; 2 studies, 127 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on all-cause mortality during hospital stay or NEC. Late paracetamol treatment versus placebo/no intervention There was little to no difference between late paracetamol and placebo for failure of ductal closure after one course of treatment when used at or after 14 days' postnatal age (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence) or NEC (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.76; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for all-cause mortality during hospital stay. Paracetamol combined with ibuprofen versus ibuprofen combined with placebo or no intervention There was little to no difference between paracetamol plus ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen plus placebo or no intervention for failure of ductal closure after the first course (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 2 studies, 111 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between paracetamol plus ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen plus placebo or no intervention for NEC (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.45; 1 study, 24 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for all-cause mortality during hospital stay. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and ibuprofen; low-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and indomethacin; low-certainty evidence suggests that prophylactic paracetamol may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; low-certainty evidence suggests that early paracetamol treatment may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; low-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference between late paracetamol treatment and placebo, and probably little or no difference in effectiveness between the combination of paracetamol plus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen alone for the closure of PDA after the first course of treatment. The majority of neonates included in these studies were of moderate preterm gestation. Thus, establishing the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for PDA treatment in extremely low birth weight (ELBW: birth weight < 1000 grams) and extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs < 28 weeks' gestation) requires further studies.",2022,,"Jasani B, Mitra S, Shah PS.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010061.pub5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,23728701,23728701,10.1002/14651858.cd010538,Topical herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Before extraction and synthetic chemistry were invented, musculoskeletal complaints were treated with preparations from medicinal plants. They were either administered orally or topically. In contrast to the oral medicinal plant products, topicals act in part as counterirritants or are toxic when given orally.<h4>Objectives</h4>To update the previous Cochrane review of herbal therapy for osteoarthritis from 2000 by evaluating the evidence on effectiveness for topical medicinal plant products.<h4>Search methods</h4>Databases for mainstream and complementary medicine were searched using terms to include all forms of arthritis combined with medicinal plant products. We searched electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform) to February 2013, unrestricted by language. We also searched the reference lists from retrieved trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials of herbal interventions used topically, compared with inert (placebo) or active controls, in people with osteoarthritis were included.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data.<h4>Main results</h4>Seven studies (six different medicinal plant interventions; 785 participants) were included. Single studies (five studies) and non-comparable studies (two studies) precluded pooling of results.Moderate evidence from a single study of 174 people with hand osteoarthritis indicated that treatment with Arnica extract gel probably results in similar benefits as treatment with ibuprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) with a similar number of adverse events. Mean pain in the ibuprofen group was 44.2 points on a 100 point scale; treatment with Arnica gel reduced the pain by 4 points after three weeks: mean difference (MD) -3.8 points (95% confidence intervals (CI) -10.1 to 2.5), absolute reduction 4% (10% reduction to 3% increase). Hand function was 7.5 points on a 30 point scale in the ibuprofen-treated group; treatment with Arnica gel reduced function by 0.4 points (MD -0.4, 95% CI -1.75 to 0.95), absolute improvement 1% (6% improvement to 3% decline)). Total adverse events were higher in the Arnica gel group (13% compared to 8% in the ibuprofen group): relative risk (RR) 1.65 (95% CI 0.72 to 3.76).Moderate quality evidence from a single trial of 99 people with knee osteoarthritis indicated that compared with placebo, Capsicum extract gel probably does not improve pain or knee function, and is commonly associated with treatment-related adverse events including skin irritation and a burning sensation. At four weeks follow-up, mean pain in the placebo group was 46 points on a 100 point scale; treatment with Capsicum extract reduced pain by 1 point (MD -1, 95% CI -6.8 to 4.8), absolute reduction of 1% (7% reduction to 5% increase). Mean knee function in the placebo group was 34.8 points on a 96 point scale at four weeks; treatment with Capsicum extract improved function by a mean of 2.6 points (MD -2.6, 95% CI -9.5 to 4.2), an absolute improvement of 3% (10% improvement to 4% decline). Adverse event rates were greater in the Capsicum extract group (80% compared with 20% in the placebo group, rate ratio 4.12, 95% CI 3.30 to 5.17). The number needed to treat to result in adverse events was 2 (95% CI 1 to 2).Moderate evidence from a single trial of 220 people with knee osteoarthritis suggested that comfrey extract gel probably improves pain without increasing adverse events. At three weeks, the mean pain in the placebo group was 83.5 points on a 100 point scale. Treatment with comfrey reduced pain by a mean of 41.5 points (MD -41.5, 95% CI -48 to -34), an absolute reduction of 42% (34% to 48% reduction). Function was not reported. Adverse events were similar: 6% (7/110) reported adverse events in the comfrey group compared with 14% (15/110) in the placebo group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.10).Although evidence from a single trial indicated that adhesive patches containing Chinese herbal mixtures FNZG and SJG may improve pain and function, the clinical applicability of these findings are uncertain because participants were only treated and followed up for seven days. We are also uncertain if other topical herbal products (Marhame-Mafasel compress, stinging nettle leaf) improve osteoarthritis symptoms due to the very low quality evidence from single trials.No serious side effects were reported.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Although the mechanism of action of the topical medicinal plant products provides a rationale basis for their use in the treatment of osteoarthritis, the quality and quantity of current research studies of effectiveness are insufficient. Arnica gel probably improves symptoms as effectively as a gel containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, but with no better (and possibly worse) adverse event profile. Comfrey extract gel probably improves pain, and Capsicum extract gel probably will not improve pain or function at the doses examined in this review. Further high quality, fully powered studies are required to confirm the trends of effectiveness identifed in studies so far.",2013,,"Cameron M, Chrubasik S.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010538,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,30521680,30521680,10.1002/14651858.cd011215.pub2,Acupuncture and related interventions for the treatment of symptoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compressive neuropathic disorder at the level of the wrist. Acupuncture and other methods that stimulate acupuncture points, such as electroacupuncture, auricular acupuncture, laser acupuncture, moxibustion, and acupressure, are used in treating CTS. Acupuncture has been recommended as a potentially useful treatment for CTS, but its effectiveness remains uncertain. We used Cochrane methodology to assess the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised trials of acupuncture for symptoms in people with CTS.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture and acupuncture-related interventions compared to sham or active treatments for the management of pain and other symptoms of CTS in adults.<h4>Search methods</h4>On 13 November 2017, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, DARE, HTA, and NHS EED. In addition, we searched six Korean medical databases, and three Chinese medical databases from inception to 30 April 2018. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials examining the effects of acupuncture and related interventions on the symptoms of CTS in adults. Eligible studies specified diagnostic criteria for CTS. We included outcomes measured at least three weeks after randomisation. The included studies compared acupuncture and related interventions to placebo/sham treatments, or to active interventions, such as steroid nerve blocks, oral steroid, splints, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), surgery and physical therapy.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>The review authors followed standard Cochrane methods.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 12 studies with 869 participants. Ten studies reported the primary outcome of overall clinical improvement at short-term follow-up (3 months or less) after randomisation. Most studies could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity, and all had an unclear or high overall risk of bias.Seven studies provided information on adverse events. Non-serious adverse events included skin bruising with electroacupuncture and local pain after needle insertion. No serious adverse events were reported.One study (N = 41) comparing acupuncture to sham/placebo reported change on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) at three months after treatment (mean difference (MD) -0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.79 to 0.33) and the BCTQ Functional Status Scale (FSS) (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.63), with no clear difference between interventions; the evidence was of low certainty. The only dropout was due to painful acupuncture. Another study of acupuncture versus placebo/sham acupuncture (N = 111) provided no usable data.Two studies assessed laser acupuncture versus sham laser acupuncture. One study (N = 60), which was at low risk of bias, provided low-certainty evidence of a better Global Symptom Scale (GSS) score with active treatment at four weeks after treatment (MD 7.46, 95% CI 4.71 to 10.22; range of possible GSS scores is 0 to 50) and a higher response rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.22). No serious adverse events were reported in either group. The other study (N = 25) did not assess overall symptom improvement.One trial (N = 77) of conventional acupuncture versus oral corticosteroids provided very low-certainty evidence of greater improvement in GSS score (scale 0 to 50) at 13 months after treatment with acupuncture (MD 8.25, 95% CI 4.12 to 12.38) and a higher responder rate (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.45). Change in GSS at two weeks or four weeks after treatment showed no clear difference between groups. Adverse events occurred in 18% of the oral corticosteroid group and 5% of the acupuncture group (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.32). One study comparing electroacupuncture and oral corticosteroids reported a clinically insignificant difference in change in BCTQ score at four weeks after treatment (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.10; N = 52).Combined data from two studies comparing the responder rate with acupuncture versus vitamin B<sub>12,</sub> produced a RR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.36; N = 100, very low-certainty evidence). No serious adverse events occurred in either group.One study of conventional acupuncture versus ibuprofen in which all participants wore night splints found very low-certainty evidence of a lower symptom score on the SSS of the BCTQ with acupuncture (MD -5.80, 95% CI -7.95 to -3.65; N = 50) at one month after treatment. Five people had adverse events with ibuprofen and none with acupuncture.One study of electroacupuncture versus night splints found no clear difference between the groups on the SSS of the BCTQ (MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.43; N = 60; very low-certainty evidence). Six people had adverse events with electroacupuncture and none with splints. One study of electroacupuncture plus night splints versus night splints alone presented no difference between the groups on the SSS of the BCTQ at 17 weeks (MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.04; N = 181, low-certainty evidence). No serious adverse events occurred in either group.One study comparing acupuncture plus NSAIDs and vitamins versus NSAIDs and vitamins alone showed no clear difference on the BCTQ SSS at four weeks (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.46; very low-certainty evidence). There was no reporting on adverse events.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Acupuncture and laser acupuncture may have little or no effect in the short term on symptoms of CTS in comparison with placebo or sham acupuncture. It is uncertain whether acupuncture and related interventions are more or less effective in relieving symptoms of CTS than corticosteroid nerve blocks, oral corticosteroids, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, ibuprofen, splints, or when added to NSAIDs plus vitamins, as the certainty of any conclusions from the evidence is low or very low and most evidence is short term. The included studies covered diverse interventions, had diverse designs, limited ethnic diversity, and clinical heterogeneity. High-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to rigorously assess the effects of acupuncture and related interventions upon symptoms of CTS. Based on moderate to very-low certainty evidence, acupuncture was associated with no serious adverse events, or reported discomfort, pain, local paraesthesia and temporary skin bruises, but not all studies provided adverse event data.",2018,,"Choi GH, Wieland LS, Lee H, Sim H, Lee MS, Shin BC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6361189,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pain from middle ear infection and pressure behind the eardrum is the key symptom of AOM. Ear pain is central to children's and parents' experience of the illness. Because antibiotics provide only marginal benefits, analgesic treatment including paracetamol (acetaminophen) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is regarded as the cornerstone of AOM management in children.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of paracetamol (acetaminophen) or NSAIDs, alone or combined, compared with placebo or no treatment in relieving pain in children with AOM. Our secondary objective was to assess the effectiveness of NSAIDs compared with paracetamol in children with AOM.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 7, July 2016; MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to August 2016), Embase (from 1947 to August 2016), CINAHL (from 1981 to August 2016), LILACS (from 1982 to August 2016) and Web of Science (from 1955 to August 2016) for published trials. We screened reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional trials. We searched WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR) for completed and ongoing trials (search date 19 August 2016).<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, for pain relief in children with AOM. We also included trials of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, for children with fever or upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) if we were able to extract subgroup data on pain relief in children with AOM either directly or after obtaining additional data from study authors.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the included trials and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence for each outcome of interest.<h4>Main results</h4>We included three RCTs (327 children) which were assessed at low to moderate risk of bias.One RCT included 219 children with AOM, and used a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind design to compare paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus placebo. All children also received antibiotics and those with fever > 39 °C could have received paracetamol (30 mg to 60 mg) additionally to the studied treatments.Another RCT involved 156 febrile children (26 of whom had AOM). The study design was a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind design and compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol.The third RCT included 889 children with respiratory tract infections (82 of whom had AOM). This study applied a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial, open-label design and compared paracetamol versus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen plus paracetamol. Study participants were randomised to one of the three treatment groups as well as two dosing groups (regular versus as required) and two steam inhalation groups (steam versus no steam).Authors of two RCTs provided crude subgroup data on children with AOM. We used data from the remaining trial to inform comparison of paracetamol versus placebo (148 children) and ibuprofen versus placebo (146 children) assessments. Data from all included RCTs informed comparison of ibuprofen versus paracetamol (183 children); data from the two RCTs informed comparison of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone (71 children).We found evidence, albeit of low quality, that both paracetamol and ibuprofen as monotherapies were more effective than placebo in relieving pain at 48 hours (paracetamol versus placebo: proportion of children with pain 10% versus 25%, RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 7; ibuprofen versus placebo: proportion of children with pain 7% versus 25%, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Very low quality evidence suggested that adverse events did not significantly differ between children treated with either paracetamol, ibuprofen or placebo.We found insufficient evidence of a difference between ibuprofen and paracetamol in relieving ear pain at 24 hours (2 RCTs, 39 children; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.18; very low quality evidence), 48 to 72 hours (3 RCTs, 183 children; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.54; low quality evidence) and four to seven days (2 RCTs, 38 children; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.23; very low quality evidence).Data on the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone came from two RCTs that provided crude subgroup data for 71 children with AOM. The small sample provided imprecise effect estimates and we were consequently unable to draw any firm conclusions (very low quality evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Despite explicit guideline recommendations on its use, current evidence on the effectiveness of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, in relieving pain in children with AOM is limited. Low quality evidence indicates that both paracetamol and ibuprofen as monotherapies are more effective than placebo in relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM. There is insufficient evidence of a difference between ibuprofen and paracetamol in relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM, whereas data on the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone were insufficient to draw any firm conclusions. Further research is needed to provide insights into the role of ibuprofen as adjunct to paracetamol, and other analgesics such as anaesthetic eardrops, for children with AOM.",2016,,"Sjoukes A, Venekamp RP, van de Pol AC, Hay AD, Little P, Schilder AG, Damoiseaux RA.",https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/343919,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Our secondary objective was to assess the effectiveness of NSAIDs as compared with paracetamol in children with AOM.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 5, April 2023; MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to May 2023), Embase (from 1947 to May 2023), CINAHL (from 1981 to May 2023), LILACS (from 1982 to May 2023), and Web of Science Core Collection (from 1955 to May 2023).

Paracetamol may be more effective than placebo in relieving pain at 48 hours (proportion of children with pain 10% versus 25%, risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of paracetamol on fever at 48 hours (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.12; very low-certainty evidence) and adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.93; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available for our other outcomes of interest. NSAIDs versus placebo Data from one trial (146 children) informed this comparison. Ibuprofen may be more effective than placebo in relieving pain at 48 hours (proportion of children with pain 7% versus 25%, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.70; NNTB 6; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen on fever at 48 hours (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.57; very low-certainty evidence) and adverse events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.44 to 7.10; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available for our other outcomes of interest. NSAIDs versus paracetamol Data from four trials (411 children) informed this comparison. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen versus paracetamol in relieving ear pain at 24 hours (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.18; 2 RCTs, 39 children; very low-certainty evidence); 48 to 72 hours (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.54; 3 RCTs, 183 children; low-certainty evidence); and four to seven days (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.23; 2 RCTs, 38 children; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen versus paracetamol on mean pain score at 24 hours (0.29 lower, 95% CI 0.79 lower to 0.20 higher; 3 RCTs, 111 children; very low-certainty evidence); 48 to 72 hours (0.25 lower, 95% CI 0.66 lower to 0.16 higher; 3 RCTs, 108 children; very low-certainty evidence); and four to seven days (0.30 higher, 95% CI 1.78 lower to 2.38 higher; 2 RCTs, 31 children; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen versus paracetamol in resolving fever at 24 hours (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.00; 2 RCTs, 39 children; very low-certainty evidence); 48 to 72 hours (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.44; 3 RCTs, 182 children; low-certainty evidence); and four to seven days (RR 2.75, 95% CI 0.12 to 60.70; 2 RCTs, 39 children; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen versus paracetamol on adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 6.90; 3 RCTs, 281 children; very low-certainty evidence); reconsultations (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.40; 1 RCT, 53 children; very low-certainty evidence); and delayed antibiotic prescriptions (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.35; 1 RCT, 53 children; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available on time to resolution of pain. NSAIDs plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone Data on the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone came from two trials that provided crude subgroup data for 71 children with AOM. The small sample provided imprecise effect estimates, therefore we were unable to draw any firm conclusions (very low-certainty evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Despite explicit guideline recommendations on the use of analgesics in children with AOM, the current evidence on the effectiveness of paracetamol or NSAIDs, alone or combined, in children with AOM is limited. Paracetamol and ibuprofen as monotherapies may be more effective than placebo in relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM. The evidence is very uncertain for the effect of ibuprofen versus paracetamol on relieving short-term ear pain in children with AOM, as well as for the effectiveness of ibuprofen plus paracetamol versus paracetamol alone, thereby preventing any firm conclusions. Further research is needed to provide insights into the role of ibuprofen as adjunct to paracetamol, and other analgesics such as anaesthetic eardrops, for children with AOM.",2023,,"de Sévaux JLH, Damoiseaux RA, van de Pol AC, Lutje V, Hay AD, Little P, Schilder AG, Venekamp RP.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011534.pub3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,26863524,26863524,10.1002/14651858.cd012087,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Chronic back pain is an important health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to treat people with low back pain, especially people with acute back pain. Short term NSAID use is also recommended for pain relief in people with chronic back pain. Two types of NSAIDs are available and used to treat back pain: non-selective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 NSAIDs. In 2008, a Cochrane review identified a small but significant effect from NSAIDs compared to placebo in people with chronic back pain. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2008 and focuses on people with chronic low back pain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine if NSAIDs are more efficacious than various comparison treatments for non-specific chronic low back pain and if so, which type of NSAID is most efficacious.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and two clinical trials registry databases up to 24 June 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, German or Dutch. We also screened references cited in relevant reviews.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included RCTs (double-blind and single-blind) of NSAIDs used to treat people with chronic low back pain.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion in this Cochrane review according to the inclusion criteria. One review author extracted the data, and a second review author checked the data. Two review authors independently evaluated the risk of bias of all included trials. If data were clinically homogeneous, we performed a meta-analysis and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 13 trials in this Cochrane review. Ten studies were at 'low' risk of bias. Six studies compared NSAIDs with placebo, and included 1354 participants in total. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo, with a mean difference in pain intensity score from baseline of -3.30 (95% CI -5.33 to -1.27) on a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (VAS) with a median follow-up of 56 days (interquartile range (IQR) 13 to 91 days). Four studies measured disability using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo on disability, with a mean difference from baseline of -0.85 (95% CI -1.30 to -0.40) on a scale from 0 to 24 with a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR 42 to 105 days). All six placebo controlled studies also reported adverse events, and suggested that adverse events are not statistically significant more frequent in participants using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17). Due to the relatively small sample size and relatively short follow-up in most included trials, it is likely that the proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event is underestimated.Two studies compared different types of non-selective NSAIDs, namely ibuprofen versus diclofenac and piroxicam versus indomethacin. The trials did not find any differences between these NSAID types, but both trials had small sample sizes. One trial reported no differences in pain intensity between treatment groups that used selective or non-selective NSAIDs. One other trial compared diflunisal with paracetamol and showed no difference in improvement from baseline on pain intensity score. One trial showed a better global improvement in favour of celecoxib versus tramadol.One included trial compared NSAIDs with 'home-based exercise'. Disability improved more in participants who did exercises versus participants receiving NSAIDs, but pain scores were similar.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Six of the 13 included RCTs showed that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo regarding pain intensity. NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo regarding disability. However, the magnitude of the effects is small, and the level of evidence was low. When we only included RCTs at low risk of bias, differences in effect between NSAIDs and placebo were reduced. We identified no difference in efficacy between different NSAID types, including selective versus non-selective NSAIDs. Due to inclusion of RCTs only, the relatively small sample sizes and relatively short follow-up in most included trials, we cannot make firm statements about the occurrence of adverse events or whether NSAIDs are safe for long-term use.",2016,,"Enthoven WT, Roelofs PD, Deyo RA, van Tulder MW, Koes BW.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012087,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,28597983,28597983,10.1002/14651858.cd012095.pub2,Celecoxib for rheumatoid arthritis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic auto-immune disorder that causes widespread and persistent inflammation of the synovial lining of joints and tendon sheaths. Presently, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment focuses on managing symptoms such as pain, stiffness and mobility, with the aim of achieving stable remission and improving mobility. Celecoxib is a selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the benefits and harms of celecoxib in people with rheumatoid arthritis.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal) to May 18, 2017. We also searched the reference and citation lists of included studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral celecoxib (200 mg and 400 mg daily) versus no intervention, placebo or a traditional NSAID (tNSAID) in people with confirmed rheumatoid arthritis, of any age and either sex. We excluded studies with fewer than 50 participants in each arm or had durations of fewer than four weeks treatment.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.<h4>Main results</h4>We included eight RCTs with durations of 4 to 24 weeks, published between 1998 and 2014 that involved a total of 3988 adults (mean age = 54 years), most of whom were women (73%). Participants had rheumatoid arthritis for an average of 9.2 years. All studies were assessed at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, evidence was assessed as moderate-to-low quality. Five studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Celecoxib versus placeboWe included two studies (N = 873) in which participants received 200 mg daily or 400 mg daily or placebo. Participants who received celecoxib showed significant clinical improvement compared with those receiving placebo (15% absolute improvement; 95% CI 7% to 25%; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.86; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 7, 95% CI 5 to 13; 2 studies, 873 participants; moderate to low quality evidence).Participants who received celecoxib reported less pain than placebo-treated people (11% absolute improvement; 95% CI 8% to 14%; NNTB = 4, 95% CI 3 to 6; 1 study, 706 participants) but results were inconclusive for improvement in physical function (MD -0.10, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.10; 1 study, 706 participants).In the celecoxib group, 15/293 participants developed ulcers, compared with 4/99 in the placebo group (Peto OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.63; 1 study, 392 participants; low quality evidence). Nine (of 475) participants in the celecoxib group developed short-term serious adverse events, compared with five (of 231) in the placebo group (Peto OR 0.87 (0.28 to 2.69; 1 study, 706 participants; low quality evidence).There were fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (163/475) compared with placebo (130/231) (22% absolute change; 95% CI 16% to 27%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72; 1 study, 706 participants).Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) were not reported. However, regulatory agencies warn of increased cardiovascular event risk associated with celecoxib. Celecoxib versus tNSAIDsSeven studies (N = 2930) compared celecoxib and tNSAIDs (amtolmetin guacyl, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, pelubiprofen); one study included comparisons of both placebo and tNSAIDs (N = 1149).There was a small improvement, which may not be clinically significant, in numbers of participants achieving ACR20 criteria response in the celecoxib group compared to tNSAIDs (4% absolute improvement; 95% CI 0% less improvement to 8% more improvement; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; 4 studies, 1981 participants). There was a lack of evidence of difference between participants in the celecoxib and tNSAID groups in terms of pain or physical function. Results were assessed at moderate-to-low quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency).People who received celecoxib had a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers ≥ 3 mm (34/870) compared with those who received tNSAIDs (116/698). This corresponded to 12% absolute change (95% CI 11% to 13%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.32; 5 studies, 1568 participants; moderate quality evidence). There were 7% fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (95% CI 4% to 9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86; 6 studies, 2639 participants).Results were inconclusive for short-term serious adverse events and cardiovascular events (low quality evidence). There were 17/918 serious adverse events in people taking celecoxib compared to 42/1236 among people who received placebo (Peto OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.28; 5 studies, 2154 participants). Cardiovascular events were reported in both celecoxib and placebo groups in one study (149 participants).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Celecoxib may improve clinical symptoms, alleviate pain and contribute to little or no difference in physical function compared with placebo. Celecoxib was associated with fewer numbers of participant withdrawals. Results for incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and short-term serious adverse events were uncertain; however, there were few reported events for either.Celecoxib may slightly improve clinical symptoms compared with tNSAIDs. Results for reduced pain and improved physical function were uncertain. Particpants taking celecoxib had lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and there were fewer withdrawals from trials. Results for cardiovascular events and short-term serious adverse events were also uncertain.Uncertainty about the rate of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and tNSAIDs could be due to risk of bias; another factor is that these were small, short-term trials. It has been reported previously that both celecoxib and tNSAIDs increase cardiovascular event rates. Our confidence in results about harms is therefore low. Larger head-to-head clinical trials comparing celecoxib to other tNSAIDs is needed to better inform clinical practice.",2017,,"Fidahic M, Jelicic Kadic A, Radic M, Puljak L.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012095.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing any oral NSAID with placebo or another active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC), serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events; secondary outcomes were adverse events, withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and outcomes relating to sleep, fatigue, and quality of life. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.<h4>Main results</h4>Our searches identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 292 participants in suitably characterised fibromyalgia. The mean age of participants was between 39 and 50 years, and 89% to 100% were women. The initial pain intensity was around 7/10 on a 0 to 10 pain scale, indicating severe pain. NSAIDs tested were etoricoxib 90 mg daily, ibuprofen 2400 mg daily, naproxen 1000 mg daily, and tenoxicam 20 mg daily; 146 participants received NSAID and 146 placebo. The duration of treatment in the double-blind phase varied between three and eight weeks.Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest. Analyses consistently showed no significant difference between NSAID and placebo: substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction) (risk difference (RD) -0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to 0.04) 2 studies, 146 participants; moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction) (RD -0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) 3 studies, 192 participants; withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.04 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.09) 4 studies, 230 participants; participants experiencing any adverse event (RD 0.08 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.19) 4 studies, 230 participants; all-cause withdrawals (RD 0.03 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.14) 3 studies, 192 participants. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. Although most studies had some measures of health-related quality of life, fibromyalgia impact, or other outcomes, none reported the outcomes beyond saying that there was no or little difference between the treatment groups.We downgraded evidence on all outcomes to very low quality, meaning that this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect could be substantially different is very high. This is based on the small numbers of studies, participants, and events, as well as other deficiencies of reporting study quality allowing possible risks of bias.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is only a modest amount of very low-quality evidence about the use of NSAIDs in fibromyalgia, and that comes from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias. That bias would normally be to increase the apparent benefits of NSAIDs, but no such benefits were seen. Consequently, NSAIDs cannot be regarded as useful for treating fibromyalgia.",2017,,"Derry S, Wiffen PJ, Häuser W, Mücke M, Tölle TR, Bell RF, Moore RA.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012332.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as important.We designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions.As the leading cause of morbidity in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (that is pain lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications (nociceptive, neuropathic, or idiopathic) from genetic conditions, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, as well as for other unknown reasons.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain, reduce fever, and for their anti-inflammation properties. They are commonly used within paediatric pain management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently licensed for use in Western countries, however they are not approved for infants under three months old. The main adverse effects include renal impairment and gastrointestinal issues. Common side effects in children include diarrhoea, headache, nausea, constipation, rash, dizziness, and abdominal pain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of NSAIDs used to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and 17 years, in any setting.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 6 September 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, as well as online clinical trial registries.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding, of any dose and any route, treating chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents, comparing any NSAID with placebo or an active comparator.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables.<h4>Main results</h4>We included seven studies with a total of 1074 participants (aged 2 to 18 years) with chronic juvenile polyarthritis or chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. All seven studies compared an NSAID with an active comparator. None of the studies were placebo controlled. No two studies investigated the same type of NSAID compared with another. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis.Risk of bias varied. For randomisation and allocation concealment, one study was low risk and six studies were unclear risk. For blinding of participants and personnel, three studies were low risk and four studies were unclear to high risk. For blinding of outcome assessors, all studies were unclear risk. For attrition, four studies were low risk and three studies were unclear risk. For selective reporting, four studies were low risk, two studies were unclear risk, and one study was high risk. For size, three studies were unclear risk and four studies were high risk. For other potential sources of bias, seven studies were low risk. Primary outcomesThree studies reported participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between meloxicam and naproxen, celecoxib and naproxen, or rofecoxib and naproxen (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence).One study reported participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between low-dose meloxicam (0.125 mg/kg) and high-dose meloxicam (0.25 mg/kg) when compared to naproxen 10 mg/kg (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence).One study reported Patient Global Impression of Change, showing 'very much improved' in 85% of ibuprofen and 90% of aspirin participants (low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomesAll seven studies reported adverse events. Participants reporting an adverse event (one or more per person) by drug were: aspirin 85/202; fenoprofen 28/49; ibuprofen 40/45; indomethacin 9/30; ketoprofen 9/30; meloxicam 18/47; naproxen 44/202; and rofecoxib 47/209 (very low-quality evidence).All seven studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. Participants withdrawn due to an adverse event by drug were: aspirin 16/120; celecoxib 10/159; fenoprofen 0/49; ibuprofen 0/45; indomethacin 0/30; ketoprofen 0/30; meloxicam 10/147; naproxen 17/285; and rofecoxib 3/209 (very low-quality evidence).All seven studies reported serious adverse events. Participants experiencing a serious adverse event by drug were: aspirin 13/120; celecoxib 5/159; fenoprofen 0/79; ketoprofen 0/30; ibuprofen 4/45; indomethacin 0/30; meloxicam 11/147; naproxen 10/285; and rofecoxib 0/209 (very low-quality evidence).There were few or no data for our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning as defined by validated scales; and quality of life as defined by validated scales (very low-quality evidence).We rated the overall quality of the evidence (GRADE rating) for our primary and secondary outcomes as very low because there were limited data from studies and no opportunity for a meta-analysis.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>We identified only a small number of studies, with insufficient data for analysis.As we could undertake no meta-analysis, we are unable to comment about efficacy or harm from the use of NSAIDs to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents. Similarly, we cannot comment on our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning; and quality of life.We know from adult randomised controlled trials that some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, can be effective in certain chronic pain conditions.",2017,,"Eccleston C, Cooper TE, Fisher E, Anderson B, Wilkinson NM.",https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012537.pub2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,38180091,38180091,10.1002/14651858.cd015432.pub2,Ibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in children.,"<h4>Background</h4>Children often require pain management following surgery to avoid suffering. Effective pain management has consequences for healing time and quality of life. Ibuprofen, a frequently used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered to children, is used to treat pain and inflammation in the postoperative period.<h4>Objectives</h4>1) To assess the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen (any dose) for acute postoperative pain management in children compared with placebo or other active comparators. 2) To compare ibuprofen administered at different doses, routes (e.g. oral, intravenous, etc.), or strategies (e.g. as needed versus as scheduled).<h4>Search methods</h4>We used standard Cochrane search methods. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trials registries in August 2023.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 17 years and younger, treated for acute postoperative or postprocedural pain, that compared ibuprofen to placebo or any active comparator. We included RCTs that compared different administration routes, doses of ibuprofen and schedules.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We adhered to standard Cochrane methods for data collection and analysis. Our primary outcomes were pain relief reported by the child, pain intensity reported by the child, adverse events, and serious adverse events. We present results using risk ratios (RR) and standardised mean differences (SMD), with the associated confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 43 RCTs that enroled 4265 children (3935 children included in this review). We rated the overall risk of bias at the study level as high or unclear for 37 studies that had one or several unclear or high risk of bias judgements across the domains. We judged six studies as having a low risk of bias across all domains. Ibuprofen versus placebo (35 RCTs) No studies reported pain relief reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen probably reduces child-reported pain intensity less than two hours postintervention compared to placebo (SMD -1.12, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.86; 3 studies, 259 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may reduce child-reported pain intensity, two hours to less than 24 hours postintervention (SMD -1.01, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.78; 5 studies, 345 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may result in little to no difference in adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.23; 5 studies, 384 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus paracetamol (21 RCTs) No studies reported pain relief reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen likely reduces child-reported pain intensity less than two hours postintervention compared to paracetamol (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.02; 2 studies, 100 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may slightly reduce child-reported pain intensity two hours to 24 hours postintervention (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.02; 6 studies, 422 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may result in little to no difference in adverse events (0 events in each group; 1 study, 44 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus morphine (1 RCT) No studies reported pain relief or pain intensity reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen likely results in a reduction in adverse events compared to morphine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.83; risk difference (RD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 4; 1 study, 154 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus ketorolac (1 RCT) No studies reported pain relief or pain intensity reported by the child, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen may result in a reduction in adverse events compared to ketorolac (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.96; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.04; NNTB 4; 1 study, 59 children; low-certainty evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Despite identifying 43 RCTs, we remain uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen compared to placebo or active comparators for some critical outcomes and in the comparisons between different doses, schedules and routes for ibuprofen administration. This is largely due to poor reporting on important outcomes such as serious adverse events, and poor study conduct or reporting that reduced our confidence in the results, along with small underpowered studies. Compared to placebo, ibuprofen likely results in pain reduction less than two hours postintervention, however, the efficacy might be lower at two hours to 24 hours. Compared to paracetamol, ibuprofen likely results in pain reduction up to 24 hours postintervention. We could not explore if there was a different effect in different kinds of surgeries or procedures. Ibuprofen likely results in a reduction in adverse events compared to morphine, and in little to no difference in bleeding when compared to paracetamol.

Thus, this work reports on the production, characterization, and release kinetics of a poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) microporous membrane containing a zeolite (Faujasite) and a magnetic stimuli-sensitive component, magnetostrictive Terfenol-D (TD), for the release of ibuprofen (IBU) as drug model. For membranes containing IBU-loaded zeolites and TD without an applied AC magnetic field, the release kinetics is characterized by a first order release. On the other hand, the application of an AC magnetic field modifies the release profile of the membrane, leading to an increase of the release rate by more than 30%, the magnetically driven release being characterized by a super case-II within the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, indicating a release mainly driven by a swelling or erosion mechanism, induced by the magnetostrictive particles under the applied magnetic field. The increase of the TD w/w from 10% to 20% has as a consequence a decrease in the quantity of IBU released from 79% to 70%; on the contrary, increasing the H <sub>AC</sub> intensity from 100 to 200 mT promotes an increase on the percentage of IBU released from 67% to 75%.",2016,,"Barbosa J, Correia DM, Gonçalves R, Ribeiro C, Botelho G, Martins P, Lanceros-Mendez S.",https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.201600591,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Menthol plays a dual role in the analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs: it causes cooling and local anesthetic effects and, being a penetration enhancer, it increases the skin permeation of the drug substances. However, there are no data concerning the skin penetration of menthol after its application in the most commonly used vehicles and in the presence of drug substances. Therefore, this study evaluated the ex vivo skin disposition of menthol after application of the commercially available drug products containing aluminum acetotartrate, methyl salicylate, ibuprofen and naproxen, using full human-skin mounted in flow-through diffusion cells. After 15, 30 and 60 min of application, the skin was progressively tape-stripped into three fractions of stratum corneum and the remaining epidermis with dermis. The content of menthol in the skin layers was determined by GC method. Varying degrees of penetration of menthol into the skin layers was observed, depending on its amount in the vehicle and the presence of drug substance. In the presence of aluminum acetotartrate, the skin penetration of menthol was limited only to the outer fraction of the stratum corneum.

The lipophilic ibuprofen-conjugated derivative of KTP-NH2 has improved analgesic efficacy. However, fast degradation by peptidases impacts negatively in the pharmacodynamics of these drugs. In this work, selected derivatives of KTP and KTP-NH2 were synthesized to combine lipophilicity and resistance to enzymatic degradation. Eight novel structural modifications were tested for the potential to transverse lipid membranes and to evaluate their efficacy in vivo. The rationale behind the design of the pool of the eight selected molecules consisted in the addition of individual group at the N-terminus, namely the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetyl, butanoyl, and propanoyl or in the substitution of the tyrosine residue by an indole moiety and in the replacement of the peptidic bond by a urea-like bond in some cases. All the drugs used in the study are intrinsically fluorescent, which enables the use of spectrofluorimetry to sample the drugs in the permeation assays. The results show that the BOC and indolyl derivatives of KTP-NH2 have maximal ability to permeate membranes with concomitant maximal analgesic power. Overall, the results demonstrate that membrane permeation is correlated with analgesic efficacy. However, this is not the only factor accounting for analgesia. KTP-NH2 for instance has low passive permeation but is known to have central action.

This case report details a 40-year-old female presenting with a 12-month history of right arm pain and restricted movement, ultimately diagnosed with Takayasu arteritis. The patient exhibited hallmark features, including a diminished right radial pulse, blood pressure asymmetry (150/92 mmHg left, 125/80 mmHg right), and mild right arm weakness (4/5 strength). Physical examination of the shoulders revealed limited active range of motion in the right shoulder, with abduction restricted to 90° and external rotation to 30°, likely due to ischemic changes, while the left shoulder showed full range of motion. Laboratory findings confirmed active inflammation, with C-reactive protein (CRP) at 18.4 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 45 mm/h, alongside mild anemia (11.5 g/dL) and reactive thrombocytosis (360-410 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). CT angiography revealed thrombotic occlusion of the left vertebral artery (60%-70%), significant narrowing with thin flow in the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, moderate occlusion with reconstituted flow in the left mid and distal brachial and radial arteries, and narrowing in the right ulnar and interosseous arteries. Additionally, a 4.0 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm was identified, a potentially life-threatening complication. Treatment was initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days), transitioning to oral prednisone (50 mg/day), combined with ibuprofen for pain (400 mg as needed, up to 1200 mg daily), amlodipine and nifedipine for hypertension, and esomeprazole for gastric protection. A multidisciplinary approach was emphasized, integrating rheumatology and vascular surgery, with plans for steroid-sparing agents (methotrexate or azathioprine) and serial aneurysm surveillance.

These catanionic vesicles were then tested as potential NSAID delivery systems for dermatological application. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vivo, and this study clearly showed an improved therapeutic effect for NSAIDs that were formulated as catanionic vesicles. These vesicles ensured a slower diffusion of the NSAID through the skin. This release probably increased the time of retention of the NSAID in the targeted strata of the skin.

Single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction studies established the existence of the PAM synthons in the gel network, confirming the efficacy of the supramolecular synthon approach employed. Most importantly, the majority of the salts (S2, S3, S6, and S7) were capable of gelling methyl salicylate (MS), an important ingredient found in many commercial topical gels. In vitro experiments (MTT and PGE2 assays) revealed that all of the salts (except S3 and S7) were biocompatible (up to 0.5 mm concentration), and the most suited one, S6, displayed anti-inflammatory ability as good as that of the parent drug ibuprofen. A topical gel of S6 with methyl salicylate and menthol was found to be suitable for delivering the gelator drug in a self-delivery fashion in treating skin inflammation in mice.

Patients were classified according to tolerance patterns to NSAIDs and other COX inhibitors (COXi) and compared for epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 87% of adults and 91% of pediatric patients tolerated NSAIDs and other COXi. Among adult and pediatric patients presenting DHRs, 5% and 0% reacted to multiple NSAIDs, 4% and 0.7% were single reactors, and 3% and 8% were single reactors with known tolerance to paracetamol but unknown tolerance to other COXi, respectively. Among adults, hypersensitivity to ≥2 drugs was more frequent among females (p = 0.009), patients with prior history of anaphylaxis to triggers other than NSAIDs or other COXi and Hymenoptera venom (p = 0.009), presence of baseline flushing (p = 0.02), baseline serum tryptase ≥48 ng/ml (p = 0.005) and multilineage KIT mutation (p = 0.02). In contrast, tolerance to NSAIDs and other COXi was more frequent among males (p = 0.02), in patients with anaphylaxis caused by Hymenoptera venom (p = 0.02), among individuals who had skin lesions due to mastocytosis (p = 0.01), and in cases that had no baseline pruritus (p = 0.006). Based on these parameters, a score model was designed to stratify mastocytosis patients who have never received NSAIDs or other COXi apart from paracetamol, according to their risk of DHR.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results suggest that despite the frequency of MC mediator related symptoms elicited by NSAIDs and other COXi apart from paracetamol is increased among mastocytosis patients versus the general population, it is lower than previously estimated and associated with unique disease features. Patients that tolerated NSAIDs and other COXi following disease onset should keep using them.

Cisplatin analogues were conjugated with COX inhibitors (indomethacin, ibuprofen) to study the synergistic effects that were previously observed in combination treatments. The conjugates ensure concerted transport of both drugs into cells, and subsequent intracellular cleavage enables a dual-action mode. Whereas the platinum(II) complexes showed cytotoxicities similar to those of cisplatin, the platinum(IV) conjugates revealed highly increased cytotoxic activities and were able to completely overcome cisplatin-related resistance. Although some of the complexes are potent COX inhibitors, the conjugates appear to execute their cytotoxic action via COX-independent mechanisms. Instead, the increased lipophilicity and kinetic inertness of the conjugates seem to facilitate cellular accumulation of the platinum drugs and thus improve the efficacy of the antitumor agents.

Neat and two types of RosA-loaded cellulose acetate (CA) mats varying in the initial content of RosA were electrospun. Microstructure of nanofibers, chemistry and physical state of RosA in nanofibers, RosA loading efficiency and RosA release in acetate buffer were investigated. To evaluate bioactivity of RosA-loaded nanofibers, their ability to inhibit protein denaturation was assayed as an indicator of anti-inflammatory properties and their antioxidant activity was determined by radical scavenging assay. The indirect cytotoxicity assay was used to find if there is a cytotoxic response to nanofibers. The homogeneous distribution of the drug within nanofibers through electrospinning led to high loading efficiency, low burst release and prolonged release of a large percentage of RosA over a period of 64h following Fickian diffusion mechanism. Nanofibers with higher RosA content exhibited anti-inflammatory activity comparable to ibuprofen, and higher antioxidant activity compared to nanofibers with lower RosA content. Additionally, extracts from nanofibers did not give any major harmful effect on cells.

Baseline transdermal kinetics in adult aquatic and arboreal frog species have recently been reported; however, there is little information regarding absorption kinetics in adult terrestrial species. The present study investigated the in vitro absorption kinetics of 3 model chemicals-caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen-through different skin regions in the terrestrial toad Rhinella marina. Caffeine flux was consistently higher than that of the other 2 chemicals (p < 0.001), whereas the fluxes of the moderately and highly lipophilic chemicals (benzoic acid and ibuprofen) were similar, regardless of skin region. When considering individual chemicals, caffeine demonstrated increased flux through the ventral pelvic skin compared with the ventral thoracic or dorsal skin regions. Flux did not differ between skin regions for either benzoic acid or ibuprofen. These findings have implications for management of environmental contamination in frog habitats, as many environmental xenobiotics are of moderate to high lipophilicity and would be expected to be equally absorbed from all skin surfaces in terrestrial toads.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential protective effects of SM extract on spermatogenesis in male Wistar rats following ibuprofen administration. A total of 42 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: control group; SM group (200 mg/kg); ibuprofen-treated groups at doses of 15 mg/kg (IbL) and 30 mg/kg (IbH); and two co-treatment groups receiving SM (200 mg/kg) along with either 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of ibuprofen. Serum levels of testosterone, FSH, and LH were measured using ELISA assay kits. Oxidative stress markers including TAC, MDA, GPx, and CAT were also assessed using specific commercial diagnostic kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Histopathological evaluation of testicular tissue was performed using the Johnsen scoring system, and sperm parameters were analyzed from the epididymal tail. Significant histopathological changes were observed only in the IbH group (30 mg/kg), showing a decrease in seminiferous tubule thickness and count compared to control (<i>p < 0.05</i>). No significant differences were found in Johnsen scores or necrosis grades among groups. Serum testosterone levels significantly increased in the SM-treated group (<i>p <</i> 0.05), while FSH and LH levels remained unchanged. The highest CAT activity was observed in the SM group, whereas the lowest was in the IbH and IbL groups (<i>p <</i> 0.05). The highest MDA level was detected in the IbL group, and the highest GPx level was seen in the SM + IbH group. Sperm parameters improved significantly in the SM-treated groups but were adversely affected by high-dose ibuprofen (<i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings indicate that ibuprofen, especially at a high dose, may impair spermatogenesis and sperm quality, potentially through induction of oxidative stress. In contrast, SM demonstrated protective effects by improving testosterone levels, enhancing antioxidant defense (TAC), and partially restoring sperm parameters. These results suggest that SM could serve as a potential natural supplement to mitigate the adverse effects of ibuprofen on male reproductive health.",2025,,"Salehi F, Zarei L, Mokhayeri Y, Rajabzadeh O.",https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.70705,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The objective of this study was to investigate the significance of the basophil activation test (BAT) for allergy diagnosis work up.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 14 patients (5 men, 9 women; mean age: 57.8 years) with clinical records of anaphylactic reactions under general anesthesia were studied by means of anesthesia records, skin and serological tests. Eleven healthy subjects without any history of allergic sensitization to anaesthetic drugs served as controls. BATs based on stimulation of whole blood cells measuring CD63 activation of basophils and using CCR3 as basophil marker by flow cytometry (Flow CAST®, BÜHLMANN Laboratories AG, Schönenbuch, Switzerland) were performed with the following substances (in dependence on the history and the skin tests of the patient): analgesics (acetylsalicylic acid, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indometacin, metamizole, paracetamol, propyphenazone, tramadol), antibiotics (PPL (benzylpenicilloyl polylysine), MDM (minor determinant mixture), amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim), local anesthetics (articaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, prilocaine, procaine, methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate), narcotics and NMBA (atracurium, cisatracurium, etomidate, neostigmine, midazolam, mivacurium, pancuronium, propofol, pyridostigmine, succinylcholine, sufentanil, thiopental, vecuronium), and other individual substances.<h4>Results</h4>Three patients showed positive results in the BAT: One to metamizole, one to PPL, and one to pancuronium.

In our study, we examine associations between factors related to inflammation and specific rectal cancer mutations. A population-based study of 750 rectal cancer cases with interview and tumor DNA were compared to 1,205 population-based controls. Study participants were from Utah and the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. Tumor DNA was analyzed for TP53 and KRAS2 mutations and CpG Island methylator phenotype. We assessed how these tumor markers were associated with use of anti-inflammatory drugs, polymorphisms in the IL6 genes (rs1800795 and rs1800796) and dietary antioxidants. Ibuprofen-type drugs, IL6 polymorphisms (rs1800796) and dietary alpha-tocopherol and lycopene significantly altered likelihood of having a TP53 mutation. This was especially true for TP53 transversion mutations and dietary antioxidants (OR for beta-carotene 0.51 95% CI 0.27, 0.97, p trend 0.03; alpha-tocopherol 0.41 95% CI 0.20, 0.84, p trend 0.02) Beta-carotene and ibuprofen significantly altered risk of KRAS2 tumors. The associations between lutein and tocopherol and TP53 and KRAS2 mutations were modified by IL6 genotype.

The sol-gel transition temperatures of the Pluronic mixtures could be controlled by adjusting F127/F68 ratio and polymer concentration. The mildly crosslinked alginate with still flow property provided the residence stability of Pluronic mixture gels in the body. Ibuprofen was loaded in Pluronic mixtures to reduce inflammatory response in the body and, thus, to prevent tissue adhesion. The gelation temperatures of the Pluronic mixtures were not affected by the alginate but lowered by the addition of ibuprofen. The in vitro drug release behavior and in vivo peritoneal tissue adhesion of the Pluronic mixtures with the sol-gel transition just below body temperatures were investigated. The drug release behavior from the ibuprofen (1 wt%)-loaded Pluronic mixture gels at 37 degrees C was examined using a membrane-less dissolution model. The drug in the mixture gels was released continuously up to about 45-65% of the total loading amount during the first 7 days. For in vivo evaluation of tissue anti-adhesion potential, the Pluronic mixtures with/without drug were coated on the peritoneal wall defects of rats and their tissue adhesion extents and tissue reactions (inflammatory response, granulation tissue formation, and toxicity in organs) were compared. It was observed that ibuprofen has a positive effect for the peritoneal tissue anti-adhesion. The Pluronic F127/F68/alginate/ibuprofen mixture gel (25 wt% of F127/F68 [7/3], 1 wt% ibuprofen) was highly effective for the prevention of peritoneal tissue adhesion and showed a relatively low inflammatory response and non-toxicity, and thus can be a good candidate material as a coatable or injectable tissue adhesion barrier gel.",2005,,"Oh SH, Kim JK, Song KS, Noh SM, Ghil SH, Yuk SH, Lee JH.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.30239,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Most of these models cater only to a phase of drug release from a constant reservoir. All these models, however, are not applicable to drug release from biodegradable triple-layered microparticle system, in which the drug-loaded core (reservoir) is surrounded by nondrug holding outer layers (membrane). In this article, a mathematical model was developed for ibuprofen release from degradable triple-layered microparticles made of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide, 50:50) (PLGA), poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate, 40 wt % vinyl acetate) (EVA), where ibuprofen was localized within the nonconstant reservoir (EVA core). The model postulated that the drug release through the bulk-degrading PLLA and PLGA layers consisted of two mechanisms: simple diffusional release followed by a degradation-controlled release through a rate-limiting membrane. The proposed model showed very good match with the experimental data of release from microparticles of various layer thicknesses and particle sizes. The underlying drug release mechanisms are dictated by three parameters determined by the model, including constant characteristic of diffusion, end time point of simple diffusion-controlled release and partition coefficient of drug.

Nanofibrous PLA scaffolds containing 10, 20, or 30 wt % ibuprofen were created and ibuprofen release profiles quantified. In vitro cytotoxicity to human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) of the three scaffolds with varying ibuprofen concentrations were evaluated and compared to pure PLA nanofibrous scaffolds. Thereafter, scaffolds loaded with ibuprofen at the concentration that promoted human skin cell viability and proliferation (20 wt %) were evaluated in vivo in nude mice using a full thickness skin incision model to determine the ability of these scaffolds to promote skin regeneration and/or assist with scarless healing. Both acellular and HEK and HDF cell-seeded 20 wt % ibuprofen loaded nanofibrous bandages reduced wound contraction compared with wounds treated with Tegaderm™ and sterile gauze. Newly regenerated skin on wounds treated with cell-seeded 20 wt % ibuprofen bandages exhibited significantly greater blood vessel formation relative to acellular ibuprofen bandages. We have found that degradable anti-inflammatory scaffolds containing 20 wt % ibuprofen promote human skin cell viability and proliferation in vitro, reduce wound contraction in vivo, and when seeded with skin cells, also enhance new blood vessel formation.

Four agents (4-methoxyphenol, naringenin, palmitoylcarnitine chloride, and silymarin) were negative in the assay. Nine of the sixteen agents were positive for both endpoints. Agents that showed the greatest response included: ellagic acid > budesonide, ibuprofen > apigenin, and quinicrine dihydrochloride.

The assay has an overall predictive accuracy of approximately 91.4% for efficacy in rodent cancer prevention irrespective of the species used, the tissue model, or the carcinogen used. Comparison of the efficacious concentrations in vitro to plasma levels in clinical trials show that concentrations that produced efficacy in the HEC assay were achieved in clinical studies for 31 of 33 agents for which plasma levels and/or C(max) levels were available.

Clinical observations suggest that these effects can be prevented, to some extent, by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We have examined the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in IL-1-induced gene expression by human skin fibroblasts in culture. Incubation of confluent fibroblast cultures with varying concentrations (0.01-1.0 microgram/ml) of PGE2 led to a dose-dependent elevation of collagenase mRNA steady-state levels, the promoter activity, and the secretion of the protein, whereas relatively little effect was observed on stromelysin and TIMP gene expression. Exogenous PGE2 had no additive or synergistic effect with IL-1 on collagenase gene expression. Furthermore, commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, acetyl salicylic acid and ibuprofen), at doses which block prostaglandin synthesis in cultured fibroblasts, failed to counteract IL-1-induced collagenase and stromelysin gene expression, nor did they affect TIMP expression. Although the effects of PGE2 did not potentiate those of IL-1 on collagenase gene expression in vitro, one could speculate that massive production of PGE2 by connective tissue cells in vivo in response to inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, could lead to sustained expression of collagenase in connective tissue cells after clearance of the growth factors.",1994,,"Mauviel A, Halcin C, Vasiloudes P, Parks WC, Kurkinen M, Uitto J.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.240540413,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

For this purpose, flurbiprofen and ibuprofen-like compounds, which are frequently used anti-inflammatory compounds in this study, were synthesized and their structures were elucidated. Like ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, the compounds contain a residue of phenylacetic acid. On the other hand, it contains a secondary amine residue. Thus, it is planned to reduce the acidity, which is the biggest side effect of NSAI drugs, even a little bit. The estimated ADME parameters of the compounds were evaluated. Apart from internal use, local use of anti-inflammatory compounds is also very important. For this reason, the skin permeability values of the compounds were also calculated. And it has been found to be compatible with reference drugs. The COX enzyme inhibitory effects of the obtained compounds were tested by in vitro experiments.

MED,16724324,16724324,10.1002/jps.20623,Penetration of crystalline powder particles into excised human skin membranes and model gels from a supersonic powder injector.,"The penetration of crystalline ibuprofen particles into excised human skin membranes and model target gels on actuation with the PowderJect ND1 ballistic needle-free injector has been examined. The deliverable dose of powder exiting the device is approximately 50% of the total cassette loading; the rest is lost via a gap forced open between the injector base and the surface of the target gel. It could be shown that substantial comminution of two different ibuprofen particle size fraction (38-53 microm, 53-75 microm) occurs within the injector on actuation. This resulted in an equiparation of the two initially different size fractions. Reduced comminution occurs with an ibuprofen/PVP (95:5) particulate formed by spray-drying/compaction/milling. On actuation into excised human skin membranes approximately 37% of cassette dose is recovered from the stratum corneum by stripping, and only 3% from the epidermis. It is concluded that powder delivery is mainly intra-epidermal with few particles fully breaching the stratum corneum. This is a consequence of the relative magnitude of the particle diameter (approximately 48 microm) and the stratum corneum thickness (approximately 10 microm). A 'soft' polyethylene glycol monolayer target gel gives the closest total percentage recovery of powder to that seen with the excised human skin membranes. Bilayer gels differentiated between surface impact/retention and penetration, but were difficult to handle.

Drug uptake into the stratum corneum (SC), following application of saturated formulations containing from 0 to 100% v/v PG, was assessed by tape-stripping. Dermatopharmacokinetic parameters, characterizing drug amount in and diffusivity through the SC, were derived. The solubility behavior of ibuprofen in PG-water mixtures was carefully evaluated, as were a number of other physical properties. Ibuprofen delivery depended on the level of PG in the vehicle, despite all formulations containing the drug at equal thermodynamic activity. PG appeared to alter the solubility of ibuprofen in the SC (presumably via its own uptake into the membrane), the effect becoming more important as the volume fraction of cosolvent in the formulation increased. In summary, tape-stripping experiments, with careful interpretation, can reveal details of a drug's bioavailability in the skin following topical application and may be used to probe the mechanism(s) by which certain excipients influence local drug delivery.",2008,,"Herkenne C, Naik A, Kalia YN, Hadgraft J, Guy RH.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.20829,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study examines the structural basis for HSA binding of Cu-PTSM and Cu-ATSM via competition with drugs having known albumin binding sites. Warfarin, furosemide, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone, benzylpenicillin, and cephmandole were added to HSA solutions at drug:HSA mole ratios from 0 to 8:1, followed by quantification of radiopharmaceutical binding to HSA by ultrafiltration. Warfarin, a site IIA drug, progressively displaced both [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM from HSA. At 8:1 warfarin:HSA mole ratios, free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM and [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM levels increased 300-500%. This was in contrast to solutions containing ibuprofen, a site IIIA drug; no increase in free [(64)Cu]Cu-PTSM or [(64)Cu]Cu-ATSM was observed except at high ibuprofen:HSA ratios, where secondary ibuprofen binding to the IIA site may cause modest radiopharmaceutical displacement. By contrast, and consistent with earlier findings suggesting Cu-ETS exhibits only nonspecific associations, [(64)Cu]Cu-ETS binding to HSA was unaffected by the addition of drugs that bind in either site.

The applicability of an electronic tongue in the development of a taste masked generic ibuprofen suspension, starting from a commercial taste masked product, was evaluated in this study. The initial screening study on 3 proprietary and 11 generic products showed that sensors of the taste sensing system TS-5000Z could clearly detect differences between the products. The variation of sensor responses were mainly caused by sodium salts, sweeteners, and preservatives, whereas pH and viscosity did not affect sensor response. In addition, the presence of the particles (20-100 µm) did not damage the sensor membranes. Based on this screening, and the known qualitative composition of the proprietary formulations, the approximate quantitative composition of a proprietary formulation could be deduced and a taste masked generic formulation could be developed using the electronic tongue data. Differences in sensor responses between the proprietary and optimized generic formulation were smaller than 11 mV for each sensor. Based on these results a rational approach of implementing an electronic tongue to simplify the development of a taste masked generic formulation could be introduced.",2011,,"Woertz K, Tissen C, Kleinebudde P, Breitkreutz J.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.22629,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The influence of these properties on transdermal formulation development, especially the relative effect of lowered melting point, on skin permeation must be carefully assessed to provide the most efficacious formulation. Thermodynamic properties and crystalline structures of the enantiomers, eutectics, and racemate of chiral ibuprofen were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. The effect of melting point lowering on membrane permeation rates was mathematically modeled. Model was validated by in vitro skin permeation experiments using different preparations of racemic ibuprofen, enantiomer, and eutectic. Both enantiomer and eutectic formed a two-phase liquid system containing an emulsifiable aqueous phase and an oily phase in the presence of aqueous isopropyl alcohol (aIPA). The eutectic emulsion had the highest permeation rate, a 2.21-fold increase in flux compared with saturated aIPA solutions of the racemate with a 2.03-fold increase in flux. Results from the two-phase liquid system supported those from the mathematical models, albeit somewhat lower, and confirmed their use in predicting maximum flux utilizing thermodynamic data.

Higher concentrations of tolazoline paradoxically did not exhibit vasodilator enhancement to ibuprofen delivery. Papaverine was tested in the same manner. In this set of experiments, PE increased the plasma ibuprofen 3.7-fold versus control, and addition of papaverine (0.0005%) increased plasma ibuprofen an additional 3.3-fold compared with the PE formulation.

Complimentary in vitro permeation studies assessed the effect of excipients on the percutaneous absorption of IBU across human skin. Following in vivo application, IBU displayed a greater tendency for lateral diffusion when applied with OS, whereas IBU resisted lateral diffusion when dosed with PG and PEG 200. After 24 h, 25.3 ± 8.0% and 55.5 ± 18.6% of IBU was recovered from the SC in vivo with and without excipients, respectively. There was a twofold-to threefold enhancement in IBU flux in vitro when applied with excipients.

Recently, we have introduced a numerical transient model describing matrix systems where the drug dissolution can be non-instantaneous. Furthermore, our model can describe complex interactions within a multi-layered matrix and the matrix to skin boundary. The power of the modelling approach presented here is further illustrated by allowing the possibility of a donor solution. The model is validated by a comparison with experimental data, as well as validating the parameter values against each other, using various configurations with donor solution, silicone matrix and skin. Our results show that the model is a good approximation to real multi-layered delivery systems. The model offers the ability of comparing drug release for ibuprofen and diclofenac, which cannot be analysed by the Higuchi model because the dissolution in the latter case turns out to be limited.

A Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used to compare the values.<h4>Results</h4>Nine patients were included in the final analysis. Peak ibuprofen plasma concentrations decreased an average of 36.4 mcg/mL after initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with a relative reduction of 41.7%. The average peak plasma concentration was 84.2 mcg/mL (SD = 10.9) prior to lumacaftor/ivacaftor initiation and 47.9 mcg/mL (SD = 16.4) following initiation (P = 0.0039). Peak concentrations occurred at an average of 100 min (SD = 30) and 107 min (SD = 40) prior to and following lumacaftor/ivacaftor initiation, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We suggest a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction exists between ibuprofen and lumacaftor/ivacaftor.

To examine how SOs affect inflammation, cytokine antibody arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to assess changes in production of cytokines and chemokines by co-cultured human dermal fibroblasts and neo-epidermal keratinocytes exposed to lipopolysaccharides and SOs from Western Australian and East Indian sandalwood trees or to the primary SO components, α-santalol and β-santalol. Lipopolysaccharides stimulated the release of 26 cytokines and chemokines, 20 of which were substantially suppressed by simultaneous exposure to either of the two sandalwood essential oils and to ibuprofen. The increased activity of East Indian SO correlated with increased santalol concentrations. Purified α-santalol and β-santalol equivalently suppressed production of five indicator cytokines/chemokines at concentrations proportional to the santalol concentrations of the oils. Purified α-santalol and β-santalol also suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the arachidonic acid metabolites, prostaglandin E2, and thromboxane B2, by the skin cell co-cultures.

As a result, platelet donors are temporarily deferred from donating if they have recently taken NSAIDs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Despite these measures, a proportion of platelet donations show exposure to these drugs; however, little is known about the effect of NSAIDs and their metabolites on platelet quality in vivo and during storage. In this review, the effect of NSAIDs on platelet function is summarized, with a focus on the widely consumed over-the-counter (OTC) medications aspirin, ibuprofen, and the non-NSAID paracetamol. Aspirin and ibuprofen have well-defined antiplatelet effects. In comparison, studies regarding the effect of paracetamol on platelets report variable findings. The timing and order of NSAID intake is important, as concurrent NSAID use can inhibit or potentiate platelet activation depending on the drug taken. NSAID deferral periods and maximum platelet shelf-life is set by each country and are revised regularly. Reduced donor deferral periods and longer platelet storage times may affect the quality of platelet products, and it is therefore important to identify the possible impact of NSAID intake on platelet quality before and after storage.",2020,,"Driver B, Marks DC, van der Wal DE.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/rth2.12283,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) is a clinically relevant platform to direct stem cell migration. Through mechanotransduction, pFUS establishes local gradients of cytokines, chemokines, trophic factors (CCTF) and cell adhesion molecules (CAM) in treated skeletal muscle that subsequently infused mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can capitalize to migrate into the parenchyma. Characterizing molecular responses to mechanical pFUS effects revealed tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) drives cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) signaling to locally increase CCTF/CAM that are necessary for MSC homing. pFUS failed to increase chemoattractants and induce MSC homing to treated muscle in mice pretreated with ibuprofen (nonspecific COX inhibitor) or etanercept (TNFα inhibitor). pFUS-induced MSC homing was also suppressed in COX2-knockout mice, demonstrating ibuprofen blocked the mechanically induced CCTF/CAM by acting on COX2. Anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, are administered to muscular dystrophy (MD) patients, and ibuprofen also suppressed pFUS-induced homing to muscle in a mouse model of MD.

Accordingly, we have exploited the heme-catalyzed hydroperoxidase activity of recombinant hCOX-2 to generate luminescence in the presence of luminol, or a cyclic naphthalene hydrazide, and the substrate arachidonic acid. Arachidonate-induced luminescence was shown to be an index of real-time catalytic activity and demonstrated the turnover inactivation of the enzyme. Luminol luminescence was proportional to hCOX-2 concentration and gave accurate Km determinations for arachidonate. Inhibition of hCOX-2 activity, measured by luminescence, by a variety of selective (for COX-2) and nonselective inhibitors showed rank orders of potency similar to those observed with other in vitro and whole cell methods using the recombinant protein. The sensitivity of the luminescence assay also allowed determination of inhibitor potency at substrate concentrations below Km, distinguishing competitive inhibitors such as ibuprofen from time-dependent inhibitors such as DuP-697.

The increased PGE2 synthesis observed for indomethacin and piroxicam (animals treated for three consecutive days) could be explained by the depression of cytochrome P-450 observed in the same animals.

MED,2488090,2488090,10.1007/bf00133206,Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion: the role of oxygen radicals in tissue injury.,"Thrombolytic therapy has gained widespread acceptance as a means of treating coronary artery thrombosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Although experimental data have demonstrated that timely reperfusion limits the extent of infarction caused by regional ischemia, there is growing evidence that reperfusion is associated with an inflammatory response to ischemia that exacerbates the tissue injury. Ischemic myocardium releases archidonate and complement-derived chemotactic factors, e.g., leukotriene B4 and C5a, which attract and activate neutrophils. Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium accelerates the influx of neutrophils, which release reactive oxygen products, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl radical and hypochlorous acid. The latter two species may damage viable endothelial cells and myocytes via the peroxidation of lipids and oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups, leading to perturbations of membrane permeability and enzyme function. Neutrophil depletion by antiserum and inhibition of neutrophil function by drugs, e.g., ibuprofen, prostaglandins (prostacyclin and PGE1), or a monoclonal antibody, to the adherence-promoting glycoprotein Mo-1 receptor, have been shown to limit the extent of canine myocardial injury due to coronary artery occlusion/reperfusion. Recent studies have challenged the hypothesis that xanthine-oxidase-derived oxygen radicals are a cause of reperfusion injury. Treatment with allopurinol or oxypurinol may exert beneficial effects on ischemic myocardium that are unrelated to the inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Furthermore, the human heart may lack xanthine oxidase activity. Further basic research is needed, therefore, to clarify the importance of xanthine oxidase in the pathophysiology of reperfusion injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989,,"Werns SW, Lucchesi BR.",http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44595/1/10557_2004_Article_BF00133206.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The results demonstrate enhanced TB passage through the endothelial barrier during exposure to high concentrations of arachidonic acid and indomethacin, but not to ibuprofen. The effect of indomethacin could be prevented by pretreatment with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone alone did not influence the barrier.

Studies using electron paramagnetic resonance.","High concentrations of corticosteroids inhibit granulocyte responses and disrupt agonist receptor function. Dose-response and time-course considerations make it unlikely that these effects are mediated via the glucocorticoid receptor, a concept further supported by the ability of sex steroids to work similar effects. We postulated that steroids nonspecifically altered granulocyte membrane fluidity, which we measured directly by electron paramagnetic resonance. As predicted, methylprednisolone caused a dose-dependent increase in order parameter (decrease in fluidity) calculated on the basis of EPR spectra, using 5-doxylstearic acid (5-DS) as a probe of resting PMN membranes. This trend was highly significant (P less than 0.001; P at 0.5 mg/ml less than 0.01). Qualitatively similar results (but with different dose-response features) were obtained with conjugated estrogen. Granulocyte agonists (such as PMA) showed an opposite effect, which was not oxidatively mediated and which was steroid-inhibitable. 16-DS showed less prominent effects, suggesting that the membrane leaflets were more strongly affected than was the deep region of the membrane. Ibuprofen, which has similar effects to those of methylprednisolone on PMN aggregation and receptor function, caused a fluidizing rather than a stiffening of the membrane; this surprising result may indicate that there is a critical range of membrane fluidity for normal function, outside of which--in either direction--agonist receptor dysfunction occurs. We conclude that the immediate effects of very high doses of steroids are probably not mediated by corticoid receptors; instead, they may be due to changes in membrane fluidity.",1990,,"Lamche HR, Silberstein PT, Knabe AC, Thomas DD, Jacob HS, Hammerschmidt DE.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00914030,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The analogs represented substitution of the lipophilic isobutyl side chains of ibufenac and ibuprofen with hydrophilic hydroxyethoxy side chains. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by administering drugs topically to inhibit inflammation induced by using either clove oil or arachidonic acid. The rank order of activity was ibufenac approximately equal to ibuprofen > R3 approximately equal to R4. The new compounds, R3 and R4, were highly water soluble (> 60-fold) and partitioned less (< 1/1500-fold) into the lipid phase when compared to ibufenac and ibuprofen. R3 and R4 each had apparent corneal permeability coefficients of 6 x 10(-6) cm/sec, whereas ibufenac and ibuprofen yielded values of about 22 x 10(-6) cm/sec. In an ocular pharmacokinetic study in the rabbit eye, constant concentrations of each compound were maintained on the cornea in a cylinder or well fixed to the cornea, resulting in a constant input rate. This method circumvented parallel loss routes at the absorption site including nasolacrimal drainage. From area calculations the dispositions of the compounds within the eye were described by mean residence times, steady state volumes of distributions, and clearance rates. R3 and R4 were more slowly absorbed, retained within eye tissues longer, and were cleared more slowly from the eye than ibufenac and ibuprofen. The aqueous humor concentration-time profiles were also computer-fitted to equations representing classical pharmacokinetic models. For ibufenac and ibuprofen, the entire cornea was assumed to be the net barrier for entry into the anterior chamber. Whereas, for R3 and R4, the corneal epithelium and endothelium were presumed to be the diffusional barriers into and out of the stroma, the latter treated as a compartment. Aqueous humor concentrations of each drug fit the models reasonable well and agreed with conclusions made from the use of area calculations. The drop volume method was used to measure the surface tension of each compound. Both ibufenac and ibuprofen were considerably more surface active than R3 or R4.

MED,7694796,7694796,10.1007/bf01526795,Inhibition of macrophage nitric oxide production by arachidonate-cascade inhibitors.,"We examined whether inhibitors of the arachidonic acid cascade inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production, as measured by nitrite concentration, either in macrophages or by their cytosolic fractions. Nitrite production by peritoneal macrophages from mice receiving OK-432 treatment was significantly inhibited by phospholipase A2 inhibitors [dexamethasone and 4-bromophenacyl bromide (4-BPB)], lipoxygenase inhibitors [nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and ketoconazole] and a glutathione S-transferase (leukotrienes LTA4-LTC4) inhibitor (ethacrynic acid). However, caffeic acid and esculetin, inhibitors of 5- and 12-lipoxygenase respectively, were not inhibitory. On the other hand, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, slightly inhibited whereas another inhibitor, ibuprofen, did not. Inhibition of the nitrite production by dexamethasone, 4-BPB, NDGA and ethacrynic acid was also demonstrated when the macrophages were restimulated ex vivo with OK-432 or with lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory activity of dexamethasone, NDGA and ethacrynic acid was significantly reduced by ex vivo restimulation with OK-432, whereas that of 4-BPB was hardly affected. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of dexamethasone, NDGA and ethacrynic acid was much higher when the macrophages were continuously exposed to the agents than when they were pulsed. Meanwhile, inhibition by 4-BPB was almost the same with either treatment. In addition, the inhibitory activity of these agents was not blocked with L-arginine, a substrate of NO synthases, or with arachidonate metabolites (LTB4, LTC4 and LTE4). Ethacrynic acid and 4-BPB, but not dexamethasone and NDGA, also inhibited nitrite production by the cytosolic fractions from OK-432-restimulated peritoneal macrophages, and the inhibitory activity of 4-BPB was superior to that of ethacrynic acid. These agents, however, did not inhibit nitrite production from sodium nitroprusside, a spontaneous NO-releasing compound. These results indicate that dexamethasone, 4-BPB, NDGA and ethacrynic acid inhibited the production of NO by macrophages through at least two different mechanisms: one was inhibited by dexamethasone, NDGA and ethacrynic acid and the other by 4-BPB. Furthermore, 4-BPB and ethacrynic acid directly inhibited the activity of the NO synthase in macrophages, suggesting that the agents work by binding to the active site(s) of the enzyme.",1993,,"Ryoyama K, Nomura T, Nakamura S.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01526795,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We undertook these experiments because the major toxic side-effects following L-MTP-PE infusion, fever and chills, could be prevented when ibuprofen was given orally immediately before L-MTP-PE infusion. It was therefore important to determine whether ibuprofen interfered with the macrophage-activation properties of L-MTP-PE. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from normal donors, then incubated with L-MTP-PE in the presence or absence of ibuprofen. The cytotoxic properties of the monocytes were assessed by a radioisotope-release assay against A375 cells. Ibuprofen at dose levels of 40 micrograms/ml suppressed the generation of the cytotoxic phenotype but did not interfere with the killing process once the cells were activated. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) production, as well as the mRNA expression of these cytokines, was suppressed by 40 micrograms/ml ibuprofen. Since IL-1 and TNF play a crucial role in the cytotoxic function of monocytes, these findings may explain the mechanism by which ibuprofen inhibited the generation of the cytotoxic phenotype by L-MTP-PE. By contrast, ibuprofen dose levels up to 10 micrograms/ml had no effect on the generation of monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity by L-MTP-PE and no effect on the production, secretion, or mRNA expression of TNF and IL-1. Therefore, we concluded that if ibuprofen is to be used to control the side-effects of L-MTP-PE, blood levels of up to 10 micrograms/ml are desirable. In two of three patients, we determined that an oral dose of 200 mg given immediately before L-MTP-PE infusion could achieve these desired blood levels.",1993,,"Fujimaki W, Griffin JR, Kleinerman ES.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01789130,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It may thus be possible to design low-molecular weight inhibitors targeted to the secretory form of mammalian PLA2. This enzyme has been implicated in inflammatory disorders. We have studied the inhibition of four distinct PLA2 enzymes by a range of NSAIDs, using 3H-oleate release from prelabelled membranes of E. coli for assay. The enzymes used were cobra venom PLA2 (Naja naja, a group I enzyme), bee venom PLA2 (Apis mellifera, group III), recombinant human synovial PLA2 (group II) and rat peritoneal PLA2 (group II). Under the conditions of the 3H-oleate E. coli assay, 1 mM concentrations of aspirin, sodium salicylate, paracetamol (acetaminophen), oxphenbutazone, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen and nabumetone failed to inhibit significantly any of the four enzymes. However, indomethacin inhibited all four enzymes, although effects were greatest on the two group II enzymes (rat peritoneal and human synovial PLA2). Approximate IC50 values were 28 and 35 microM, respectively. Inhibition by indomethacin was not time dependent and was greater at micromolar rather than millimolar levels of calcium. We conclude that indomethacin but not the other tested classes of NSAID inhibits the group II PLA2 enzyme in a selective manner and suggest that this may be relevant both to its clinical spectrum and to the design of novel pharmaceutical leads.",1994,,"Lobo IB, Hoult JR.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01986409,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In the present study the effects of benzydamine on the production of several inflammatory cytokines were examined in cultures of Candida albicans-stimulated human mononuclear cells. Benzydamine (6.25-50 microM) inhibited Candida-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and, to a lesser extent, interleukin-1 beta production, whereas it did not affect interleukin-6 release. Benzydamine also blocked monocyte chemotactic protein-1 secretion, but it did not affect interleukin-8 production. Unlike benzydamine, ibuprofen and naproxen, two non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs also used topically, were unable to suppress inflammatory lymphokine production from Candida-activated mononuclear cells.

COX-2 inhibition was assessed by measuring 6-keto-PGF1alpha in supernatants of intact cells of LPS-stimulated J774.2 cells (murine) and of Mono Mac 6 cells (human). In whole blood inhibition of COX-1 was performed by measuring TXB2 formation after clotting, and COX-2 inhibition was examined in LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures. The reduction of NO levels as a measure of the inhibition of cellular NO formation was assayed in supernatants of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells using the Griess reaction. Compound influence on the formation ofTNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 was examined using LPS-stimulated monocytic cells (THP-1) and measurement of cytokine concentrations by specific ELISAs.<h4>Results</h4>In intact human cells, lornoxicam showed a balanced inhibition of COX-1/-2 exhibiting the lowest IC50 (0.005 microM/0.008 microM) of the large panel of NSAIDs tested. Similar results were obtained in the whole blood for COX-1/-2. NO formation was dose-dependently inhibited by lornoxicam (IC50 of 65 microM) whereas piroxicam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketorolac and naproxen inhibited the NO formation markedly less. Indomethacin was approximately equipotent with lornoxicam. In stimulated monocytic cells (THP-1), lornoxicam showed a marked inhibition of IL-6 formation (IC50 54 microM) while the formation ofTNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-8 was only moderately affected.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Of the panel of NSAIDs tested, lornoxicam was found to be the most potent balanced inhibitor of human COX-1/-2. The equipotent COX-isoenzyme inhibition by lornoxicam is complemented by a marked inhibition of IL-6 production and of iNOS-derived NO formation.

ELISAs were employed to assess PGE2, PGI2 and IL-6 synthesis.<h4>Results</h4>We found that COX-2 expression is upregulated when HUVEC are cultured with CD154+ D1.1 cells but not CD154- B2.7 cells. This effect was specifically inhibited by anti-CD154 mAb, and was amplified by the presence of IFNgamma. Analysis of cell supernatants showed a concomitant rise in PGE2 and PGI2 secretion triggered by CD154+ D1.1 cells, or rsCD154. Use of selective (NS-398) and non-selective (ibuprofen) COX-2 inhibitors effectively inhibited prostanoid synthesis triggered by CD40 ligation. Reduction in prostanoid levels by NS-398 was accompanied by a reduction in IL-6 secretion levels triggered by CD40 ligation. Furthermore, exogenously added PGE2 triggered a dose-dependent IL-6 secretion, which was unaffected by NS-398.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These studies demonstrate that CD40 ligation upregulates HUVEC COX-2 expression and function.

MED,8179173,8179173,10.1007/s001010050053,[The effect of thoracic epidural anesthesia on the pathophysiology of the eventration syndrome].,"Abdominal mesenteric traction (MT) results in decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased cardiac output (CO). This response is induced by a considerable release of prostacyclin (PGI2). Precipitous falls in systemic arterial pressure related to central and/or autonomic nervous reflex arcs also have been described during operations on the upper abdominal viscera. Those hypotensive responses to visceral traction appear to be transmitted along afferent fibres contained within the splanchnic nerves. We investigated the influence of supplementary thoracic epidural anaesthesia on mesenteric traction response during major abdominal surgery. METHODS. With the approval of the Human Investigation Review Board we studied 40 patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery (infrarenal aortic, gastrointestinal and pancreatic surgery) according to a prospective, randomized double-blinded protocol. Patients were randomized to two different anaesthetic regimens. Patients in group 1 received general anaesthesia (GA n = 20) with 0.1-0.15 mg/kg midazolam and 10 micrograms/kg fentanyl prior to skin incision. Maintenance included 65% nitric oxide in oxygen and 0.1 mg increments of fentanyl as required. Group 2 patients (EA n = 20) underwent a combined technique of dose-reduced general anaesthesia and supplementary continuous, thoracic epidural anaesthesia (bupivacaine 0.25%, sensory blockade T4 to L1-3). In both anaesthesia groups ibuprofen (400 mg i.v.) or a placebo equivalent was administered 15 min before the induction of anaesthesia. MT was applied in a uniform fashion. Baseline values preceded the incision of the peritoneum. Further assessments followed 5, 15 and 30 min after MT. The plasma concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (stable metabolite of PGI2), TXB2 (stable metabolite of thromboxane), PGF2 alpha, KH2-PGF2 alpha (stable metabolite of PGF2 alpha) were determined by radioimmunoassay. At all assessments we recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and measured arterial blood gases. Statistical analyses were performed using three-factor ANOVA for repeated measurements after log(x) transformation. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant when the Bonferroni-Holm adjustment was applied. RESULTS. Patients with supplementary epidural anaesthesia demonstrated lower systolic (P = 0.0001) and diastolic (P = 0.006) blood pressure than those in the GA group. Nevertheless, in untreated patients in the EA and GA group there was a significant decrease of about 20-30% in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0001) after mesenteric traction. Irrespective of the anaesthetic procedure, paO2 (P = 0.0001) decreased after mesenteric traction in the placebo group. The control patients in the GA group exhibited a more pronounced increase in heart rate after MT. After traction on the mesentery a significant 20- to 30-fold increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha plasma concentrations occurred in the placebo group: GA group 1950/58 (5 min), 1574/59 (15 min) 858/66 (30 min) ng/l, P < 0.0001; EA group: 2002/106 (5 min), 2955/107 (15 min) 1807/70 (30 min) ng/l, P < 0.0001, for placebo vs ibuprofen. There was no statistically significant difference between the two anaesthetic procedures used. In ibuprofen-pretreated patients haemodynamics and paO2 values were stable, while 6-keto-PGF1 alpha plasma concentrations remained within the normal range. CONCLUSION. Our data clearly indicate that the mesenteric traction response consists in relevant haemodynamic alterations and a significant decrease of paO2. Stable haemodynamics and paO2 following cyclooxygenase inhibition signify an action mediated by prostacyclin. Deafferentation of the splanchnic nerves by supplementary thoracic epidural anaesthesia did not influence either prostacyclin release or the decrease in blood pressure and paO2 after traction on the mesentery root...",1994,,"Brinkmann A, Seeling W, Wolf CF, Kneitinger E, Junger S, Rockemann M, Oettinger W, Georgieff M.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s001010050053,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In addition to cholinergic crisis, neurodegeneration and brain damage are hallmarks of the severe form of this toxidrome. Recently, we generated a chemical model of severe acute OP intoxication in zebrafish that is characterized by altered head morphology and brain degeneration. The pathophysiological pathways resulting in brain toxicity in this model are similar to those described in humans. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive power of this zebrafish model by testing the effect of a panel of drugs that provide protection in mammalian models. The selected drugs included ""standard therapy"" drugs (atropine and pralidoxime), reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (huperzine A, galantamine, physostigmine and pyridostigmine), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (MK-801 and memantine), dual-function NMDA receptor and acetylcholine receptor antagonists (caramiphen and benactyzine) and anti-inflammatory drugs (dexamethasone and ibuprofen). The effects of these drugs on zebrafish survival and the prevalence of abnormal head morphology in the larvae exposed to 4 µM chlorpyrifos oxon [1 × median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>)] were determined. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of pralidoxime, memantine, caramiphen and dexamethasone at the gross morphological level were confirmed by histopathological and transcriptional analyses.

In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease. In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective. In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.

The effect of different concentrations of indomethacin, sodium salicylate, ibuprofen, meloxicam, lysine clonixinate or NS-398 administrated 30 min before concentration-response curves (CRC) was studied. All treatments produced a significant rightward shift of the CRC to des-Arg9-BK in a concentration-dependent manner, which provides pharmacological evidence that COX pathway is involved in the BK B1 responses. Moreover, in this tissue, the NS-398 pKb (5.2) observed suggests that COX-2 pathway is the most relevant. The strong correlation between published pIC50 for COX-2 and the NSAIDs' pKbs estimated further supports the hypothesis that COX-2 metabolites are involved in BK B1 receptor-mediated responses. In other rings, indomethacin (30, 100 micromol/l) or NS-398 (10, 30 micromol/l) produced a significant rightward shift of the CRC to BK, selective BK B2 agonist, and its pKbs were similar to the values to inhibit BK B1 receptor responses, suggesting that COX-2 pathway also is involved in BK B2 receptor responses.

Three studies were conducted to evaluate the early phase (acute, day 1) and late phase (days 2-12) effects of SJP-005 on discontinuation-induced morphine withdrawal.<h4>Methods</h4>Sprague-Dawley rats received subcutaneous morphine twice daily for 18 days and ceased on day 19. Twice daily, oral dosages of placebo or SJP-005 (1 mg/kg ketotifen and 15 mg/kg ibuprofen) were administered starting 4 days before (study 1), 2 days before (study 2), or immediately after (study 3) morphine cessation.

Commercially available cattle intestine natural membranes (NM), polyethersulfone (PES), and regenerated cellulose-based (RC) flat membranes (nominal cut-off 1 kDa) have been investigated as ultrafiltration membranes in a small tangential-flow ultrafiltration unit (TF-UF). First, the nominal cut-off of the NM membranes under study was assessed at approximately 5 kDa, by using polystyrenesulfonate standards for pore-size classification at low TF-UF pressure (0.25 x 10(5) Pa). Working pressures of >1.5 x 10(5) Pa strongly increased the cut-off of NM, in contrast with that of PES and RC membranes. Sulfa, Carba, Diclo and Ibu (1 mg L(-1) each) in colloid-free aqueous solutions (400 mg L(-1) NaCl) completely permeated through NM membranes, but less through PES and RC, which had particular sorption capability towards Diclo. The drugs were routinely determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Detailed TF-UF investigation of drug retention on NM in the presence of humic hydrocolloids revealed strong interactions between aquatic humic substances (HS) and Diclo and Ibu (but not with Sulfa and Carba) causing retention of up to 80% of Diclo and Ibu, probably because of their binding to macromolecular HS. The standard deviation (SD) of both drug and HS permeation through a single NM was between 2.5 (Sulfa) and 4.0% (Diclo), in contrast with the SD of permeation through separate membranes taken from different lots [SD up to 14.0% (Diclo)], presumably caused by natural variation of the studied NM. Accordingly, membrane filtration of drug-containing water samples on cattle intestines enables both analyte/matrix separations for Carba and Sulfa in the presence of humic colloids and analytical discrimination between free and colloid-bound Diclo and Ibu fractions.",2005,,"Burba P, Geltenpoth H, Nolte J.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-005-3296-z,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study the behaviour of several pharmaceutical products in different therapeutic categories (analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid regulators, antibiotics, etc.) was monitored during treatment of wastewater in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The results were compared with removal in a conventional activated-sludge (CAS) process in a wastewater-treatment facility. The performance of an MBR was monitored for approximately two months to investigate the long-term operational stability of the system and possible effects of solids retention time on the efficiency of removal of target compounds. Pharmaceuticals were, in general, removed to a greater extent by the MBR integrated system than during the CAS process. For most of the compounds investigated the performance of MBR treatment was better (removal rates >80%) and effluent concentrations of, e.g., diclofenac, ketoprofen, ranitidine, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, pravastatin, and ofloxacin were steadier than for the conventional system. Occasionally removal efficiency was very similar, and high, for both treatments (e.g. for ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, paroxetine, and hydrochlorothiazide). The antiepileptic drug carbamazepine was the most persistent pharmaceutical and it passed through both the MBR and CAS systems untransformed.

Epithelial cells of the intact cornea were impaled with microelectrodes. Under short-circuit current (I(sc)) conditions, 10(-4) M ibuprofen (IBU) (non-specific COX inhibitor) or 5 x 10(-5) M rofecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) were added to the tear solution. With ibuprofen, I(sc) decreased by 1.0 from 3.1 microA/cm2; intracellular potential, V(o), depolarized by 14.2 from -56.9 mV; IBU did not affect the transepithelial conductance, g(t), or the apical membrane fractional resistance, fR(o). With rofecoxib, I(sc) decreased by 0.9 from 4.3 microA/cm2; V(o) depolarized by 18 from -62.4 mV; g(t) significantly increased by 0.03 from 0.37 ms/cm2; and fR(o) decreased by 12 from 50. Basolateral membrane K+ and apical membrane Cl- partial conductances were studied by the ion substitution method. Depolarization of V(o) by an increase in stromal K+ from 4 to 79 mM was smaller with IBU (17.5 mV) or rofecoxib (19.2 mV) than without the inhibitors (29.1 and 29.3 mV, respectively). Depolarization of V(o), by a decrease in tear Cl- from 81 to 8.1 mM, was abolished by the COX inhibitors. Decrease in I(sc) and V(o) can be explained by a decrease in the K+ and Cl-? conductances.

The CECs detected most frequently in samples were PBDEs (100 %), salicylic acid (81 %), thiabendazole (50 %), and caffeine (23 %). Other compounds detected in at least 15 % of bat samples were digoxigenin, ibuprofen, warfarin, penicillin V, testosterone, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). The CECs present at the highest geometric mean wet weight concentrations in bat carcasses were bisphenol A (397 ng/g), ΣPDBE congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 (83.5 ng/g), triclosan (71.3 n/g), caffeine (68.3 ng/g), salicylic acid (66.4 ng/g), warfarin (57.6 ng/g), sulfathiazole (55.8 ng/g), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (53.8 ng/g), and DEET (37.2 ng/g). Bats frequently forage in aquatic and terrestrial habitats that may be subjected to discharges from wastewater-treatment plants, agricultural operations, and other point and nonpoint sources of contaminants.

The impact of these biologically active compounds on ecosystems is hard to predict, and information on their biodegradation is necessary to establish sound risk assessment. Microbial communities are promising candidates for the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, but little is known yet about their degradation capacity of multiple micropollutants at higher concentrations (100 mg/L). In this work, microbial communities were cultivated in lab-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) exposed to increasing concentrations of a mixture of six micropollutants (ibuprofen, diclofenac, enalapril, caffeine, atenolol, paracetamol). Key players of biodegradation were identified using a combinatorial approach of 16S rRNA sequencing and analytics. Microbial community structure changed with increasing pharmaceutical intake (from 1 to 100 mg/L) and reached a steady-state during incubation for 7 weeks on 100 mg/L. HPLC analysis revealed a fluctuating but significant degradation (30-100%) of five pollutants (caffeine, paracetamol, ibuprofen, atenolol, enalapril) by an established and stable microbial community mainly composed of Achromobacter, Cupriavidus, Pseudomonas and Leucobacter. By using the microbial community from MBR1 as inoculum for further batch culture experiments on single micropollutants (400 mg/L substrate, respectively), different active microbial consortia were obtained for each single micropollutant. Microbial genera potentially responsible for degradation of the respective micropollutant were identified, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. and Sphingobacterium sp. for ibuprofen, caffeine and paracetamol, Sphingomonas sp. for atenolol and Klebsiella sp. for enalapril. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of cultivating stable microbial communities capable of degrading simultaneously a mixture of highly concentrated pharmaceuticals in lab-scale MBRs and the identification of microbial genera potentially responsible for the degradation of specific pollutants.

However, their therapeutic value is impaired by the short tumor residence time. Several strategies have been tested to overcome this limitation, but a head-to-head comparison has never been done. With the aim to identify strengths and limitations of the suggested strategies, we compared the monomer FAPI-46 versus (a) its dimer (FAPI-46-F1D), (b) two albumin binders conjugates (FAPI-46-Ibu (ibuprofen) and FAPI-46-EB (Evans Blue)), and (c) cyclic peptide FAP-2286.<h4>Methods</h4><sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled ligands were evaluated in vitro in cell lines with low (HT-1080.hFAP) and high (HEK-293.hFAP) humanFAP expression.

The areas under the curve (AUC) of the tumor uptake and tumor-to-critical-organs ratios and the absorbed doses were estimated.<h4>Results</h4>Radioligands showed IC<sub>50</sub> in the picomolar range. Striking differences were observed in vivo regarding tumor uptake, residence, specificity, and total body distribution. All [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-FAPI-46-based radioligands showed similar uptake between the two tumor models. [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-FAP-2286 showed higher uptake in HEK-293.hFAP and the least background. The AUC of the tumor uptake and absorbed dose was higher for [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-FAPI-46-F1D and the two albumin binder conjugates, [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-FAPI-46-Ibu and [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-FAPI-46-EB, in HT1080.hFAP xenografts and for [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-FAPI-46-EB and [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-FAP-2286 in HEK293.hFAP xenografts.

The distribution of MS-275 in plasma was studied in vitro using equilibrium dialysis and ex vivo in five cancer patients receiving the drug orally at a dose of 10 mg/m(2). The dialysis method uses a tracer amount of [G-(3)H]MS-275 on a 96-well microdialysis plate with a 5-kDa cut-off membrane, and requires 250 microl sample. The time to equilibrium was established to be within 5 h, and the mean unbound fraction of MS-275 (f (u)) over a presumed therapeutic concentration range in healthy volunteer human plasma was 0.188 +/- 0.0075 as compared to 0.168 +/- 0.0144 in cancer patients.

CF-related CRS treatment is extremely challenging because of the underlying genetic defect leading to its development. CRS in CF is often refractory to standard therapy, while recurrences after surgical treatment are inevitable in the majority of patients. This study provides a precise review of the current knowledge regarding possible therapeutic options for CF-related CRS.<h4>Methods</h4>The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms ""cystic fibrosis"" in conjunction with ""otorhinolaryngological manifestation"", ""rhinology"" and ""sinusitis"".<h4>Results</h4>Precise guidelines for CF-induced CRS therapy are lacking due to the lack of large cohort randomized controlled trials. None of the existing therapeutic agents has already been recommended for CRS in CF. Therapy targeting the underlying genetic defect, intranasal dornase alfa administration, and topical delivery of colistin and tobramycin showed promising results in CF-related CRS therapy. Besides the potential effectiveness of nasal steroids, strong recommendations for their usage in CF have not been provided yet. Systemic corticosteroid usage is controversial due to its potential negative influence on pulmonary disease. Ibuprofen revealed some positive effects on CF-related CRS in molecular and small cohort studies. Intranasal irrigation with saline solutions could relieve sinonasal symptoms. Nasal decongestants are not recommended. Endoscopic sinus surgery is the first-line surgical option for refractory CRS. Extensive surgical approaches should be considered as they could improve long-term outcomes in CRS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Further studies are warranted to establish consensus for CF-related CRS therapy.",2022,,"Krajewska J, Zub K, Słowikowski A, Zatoński T.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-021-06875-6,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Eight healthy, recreationally active males ingested 800 mg Ibuprofen or a placebo ~ 1 h prior to performing fixed RPE cycling for 60 min in 35 °C and 60% relative humidity at an intensity of hard to very hard (RPE = 16) with intermittent maximal (RPE = 20) sprints every 10 min.

The objectives of this study are to describe the current pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia practice patterns in European emergency departments, to perform a needs assessment-like analysis, and to identify barriers to implementation. A survey study of European emergency departments treating children was conducted. Through a lead research coordinator identified through the Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine (REPEM) network for each of the participating countries, a 30-question questionnaire was sent, targeting senior physicians at each site. Descriptive statistics were performed. One hundred and seventy-one sites participated, treating approximately 5 million children/year and representing 19 countries, with a response rate of 89%. Of the procedural sedation and analgesia medications, midazolam (100%) and ketamine (91%) were available to most children, whereas propofol (67%), nitrous oxide (56%), intranasal fentanyl (47%), and chloral hydrate (42%) were less frequent. Children were sedated by general pediatricians in 82% of cases. Safety and monitoring guidelines were common (74%), but pre-procedural checklists (51%) and capnography (46%) less available. In 37% of the sites, the entire staff performing procedural sedation and analgesia were certified in pediatric advanced life support. Pediatric emergency medicine was a board-certified specialty in 3/19 countries. Physician (73%) and nursing (72%) shortages and lack of physical space (69%) were commonly reported as barriers to procedural sedation and analgesia. Nurse-directed triage protocols were in place in 52% of the sites, mostly for paracetamol (99%) and ibuprofen (91%). Tissue adhesive for laceration repair was available to 91% of children, while topical anesthetics for intravenous catheterization was available to 55%. Access to child life specialists (13%) and hypnosis (12%) was rare.Conclusion: Procedural sedation and analgesia are prevalent in European emergency departments, but some sedation agents and topical anesthetics are not widely available. Guidelines are common but further safety nets, nurse-directed triage analgesia, and nonpharmacologic support to procedural sedation and analgesia are lacking. Barriers to implementation include availability of sedation agents, staff shortage, and lack of space.

Smoking is a documented risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and the risk is increased in smokers who also consume alcohol. Arachidonic acid (AA)-metabolizing enzymes have been implicated in aggressive clinical behavior of pancreatic cancer while mutations in the Ki- ras gene have been associated with prolonged survival and responsiveness to therapy. Using a hamster model of exocrine pancreatic cancer induced by transplacental exposure to ethanol and the tobacco-carcinogen NNK, we have analyzed these tumors for mutations in the ras and p53 genes and tested the modulating effects of the COX inhibitor, ibuprofen, and the FLAP inhibitor, MK886, on the development of pancreatic cancer in this animal model.<h4>Methods</h4>Hamsters were given 10% ethanol in the drinking water from the fifth to the last day of their pregnancy and a single dose of NNK on the last day. Starting at 4 weeks of age, groups of offspring were given either the COX inhibitor ibuprofen (infant Motrin oral suspension) or the FLAP-inhibitor MK886 (dissolved in carboxymethylcellulose orally) for life while a group of offspring not receiving any treatment served as positive controls.<h4>Results</h4>None of the induced pancreatic cancers demonstrated mutations in the Ki-, N-, or H- ras or p53 genes. The development of pancreatic cancer in offspring who had been given ibuprofen or MK886 was reduced by 50% or 30%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In conjunction with the documented over-expression of COX-2 and LOX in human pancreatic cancer, our findings suggest an important role of the AA-cascade in the genesis of this cancer type and indicate that pharmacological or dietary measures that reduce AA-metabolism may be useful for the prevention and clinical management of pancreatic cancer.",2002,,"Schuller HM, Zhang L, Weddle DL, Castonguay A, Walker K, Miller MS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/12164402,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In addition, preoperative administration of ibuprofen has proved to reduce interleukin-6 (IL-6) release, while that of ranitidine reduced postoperative IL-6-induced C-reactive protein synthesis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. However, it has not been established whether the preoperative administration of both types of drugs may reduced the postoperative inflammatory reaction after instrumented spinal surgery. Accordingly, our objective was to investigate the effects of preoperative treatment with naproxen plus famotidine on the postoperative systemic inflammatory reaction in patients undergoing instrumented lumbar spinal surgery. Forty consecutive patients scheduled for elective instrumented spinal fusion were alternately assigned to receive either naproxen (500 mg/day, p.o.) plus famotidine (40 mg/day, p.o.) for 7 days before operation, or no adjuvant treatment. Haematological parameters, acute phase proteins, complement fractions, immunoglobulins and cytokines were determined 7 days and immediately before surgery, and on days 0, 1, 2 and 7 after surgery. Haematological parameters, clinical data, duration of surgery, blood loss, perioperative blood transfusion and postoperative complications were similar in the two groups, although pretreated patients showed lower increases in body temperature and required less analgesic medication. Compared with preoperative levels, IL-6 levels were significantly increased postoperatively in all patients with no differences between groups. C-reactive protein, alpha(1)-acid-glycoprotein and haptoglobin levels were also significantly increased postoperatively in all patients; however, they were significantly lower in pretreated patients. In conclusion, perioperative treatment with naproxen plus famotidine was well tolerated and reduced the acute phase response after instrumented spinal surgery.

One derivative demonstrated strong reduction of lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by anti-CD3 antibody (by 90%) and PHA, as well as low cell toxicity. The obtained compounds exhibited relatively weak antibacterial activity; they were more effective against Gram-positive bacterial strains.<h4>Graphical abstract</h4>",2018,,"Paprocka R, Wiese-Szadkowska M, Helmin-Basa A, Mazur L, Kutkowska J, Michałkiewicz J, Modzelewska-Banachiewicz B, Pazderski L.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00706-018-2197-8,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The Ib moiety is an enhancer of KTP-NH2 analgesic action. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that KTP-NH2 is an enhancer of the Ib anti-inflammatory action. Moreover, the impact of the IbKTP-NH2 conjugation on microcirculation was also evaluated by a unified approach based on intravital microscopy in the murine cremasteric muscle. Our data show that KTP-NH2 and conjugates do not cause damage on microcirculatory environment and efficiently decrease the number of leukocyte rolling induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the drugs bind to LPS directly thus contributing to LPS aggregation and subsequent elimination. In a parallel study, molecular dynamics simulations and NMR data showed that the IbKTP-NH2 tandem adopts a preferential ""stretched"" conformation in lipid bilayers and micelles, with the simulations indicating that the Ib moiety is anchored in the hydrophobic core, which explains the improved partition of IbKTP-NH2 to membranes and the permeability of lipid bilayers to this conjugate relative to KTP-NH2. The ability to bind glycolipids concomitant to the anchoring in the lipid membranes through the Ib residue explains the analgesic potency of IbKTP-NH2 given the enriched glycocalyx of the blood-brain barrier cells. Accumulation of IbKTP-NH2 in the membrane favors both direct permeation and local interaction with putative receptors as the location of the KTP-NH2 residue of IbKTP-NH2 and free KTP-NH2 in lipid membranes is the same.",2016,,"Conceição K, Magalhães PR, Campos SR, Domingues MM, Ramu VG, Michalek M, Bertani P, Baptista AM, Heras M, Bardaji ER, Bechinger B, Ferreira ML, Castanho MA.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-015-2088-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

RuIbp increased the expression of cell cycle-related proteins such as p21 and p27 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, as well as causing a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and a modest increase in apoptosis in vitro. The present study extended these findings by (i) investigating the effects of RuIbp on human glioma cell line proliferation in vitro and (ii) investigating the acute and chronic toxicology of the compound in normal Wistar rats. The compound was then tested for its anti-tumour properties by either chronic 14 days intra-peritoneal (IP) administration or chronic Alzet osmotic pump infusion, in the rat C6 orthotopic glioma model in vivo. The IP injection of RuIbp caused a 41 % inhibition of tumour area without significant toxic effects but with an increase in blood neutrophils and monocytes and a decrease in blood lymphocytes. In an attempt to reduce this effect RuIbp was administered by Alzet osmotic pump infusion directly into the tumour at a dose of 15 mg/kg with an infusion rate of 0.5 µL/h for 14 days. The direct infusion of RuIbp caused a 45 % inhibition of tumour area without alterations in differential blood leukocyte counts.

It is associated with progressive histological alterations and disabling symptoms. Today, drugs such as glucocorticoids (GCs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSIADs) are commonly employed for treatment of osteoarthritis, but have serious and life-threatening side effects. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effects of escin on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, isoform), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-18 (IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and nitric oxide (NO) (1), as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on inflammatory cells, similar osteoarthritis in synoviocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, and to compare it with dexamethasone (DEX) and ibuprofen (IBP). Synovial cells were isolated from synovial membrane of the radiocarpal joint cartilage of an 8-month-old Holstein cow. THP-1 cells were prepared from Pasteur Institute of Iran. Cells were cultivated and exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation without, or in the presence of, DEX, IBP, or escin. The gene expressions of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-18, COX-2, and iNOS were evaluated by real-time PCR. Concentrations of NO and PGE2 were measured by ELISA methods. Our cells secreted an increased amounts of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-18, COX-2, iNOS, NO, and PGE2 in response to LPS stimulation in all conditions. Escin can quench the gene expression of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α in synoviocyte cells and production of NO and PGE2 in monocyte/macrophage cells alike DEX and IBP.

Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Points• Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.• Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.• Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.",2020,,"Misra DP, Agarwal V, Gasparyan AY, Zimba O.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05073-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This inconsistency may result from differences in etiology for breast tumors of different subtypes. We examined the association between NSAID use and breast cancer characterized by molecular subtypes in a population-based case-control study in Western New York. Cases (n = 1,170) were women with incident, primary, histologically confirmed breast cancer. Controls (n = 2,115) were randomly selected from NY Department of Motor Vehicles records (<65 years) or Medicare rolls (≥ 65 years). Participants answered questions regarding their use of aspirin and ibuprofen in the year prior to interview and their use of aspirin throughout their adult life. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Recent and lifetime aspirin use was associated with reduced risk, with no differences by subtype. Recent use of ibuprofen was significantly associated with increased risk of ER+/PR+(OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.09-1.62), HER2- (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05-1.53), and p53- breast cancers (OR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.57), as well as luminal A or B breast cancers.

The underlying mechanisms of neuronal loss are not fully understood, but the activation of CNS resident phagocytic microglia seems to be a significant element contributing to neurodegeneration. At the onset of inflammation, high levels of microglial phagocytosis may serve as an essential prerequisite for creating a favorable environment for neuronal regeneration. However, the excessive and long-lasting activation of microglia and the augmented engulfment of neurons have been suggested to eventually govern widespread neurodegeneration. Here, we investigated in a functional assay of acute inflammation how the small GTPase RhoA and its main target the Rho kinase (ROCK) influence microglial phagocytosis of neuronal debris. Using BV-2 microglia and human NT2 model neurons, we demonstrate that the pain reliever Ibuprofen decreases RhoA activation and microglial phagocytosis of neuronal cell fragments. Inhibition of the downstream effector ROCK with the small-molecule agents Y-27632 and Fasudil reduces the engulfment of neuronal debris and attenuates the production of the inflammatory mediator nitric oxide during stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Our results support a therapeutic potential for RhoA/ROCK-inhibiting agents as an effective treatment of excessive inflammation and the resulting progression of microglia-mediated neurodegeneration in the CNS.",2017,,"Scheiblich H, Bicker G.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-016-0379-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In addition to the classical mode of action of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indomethacin, and ibuprofen have Rho-inhibiting effects. In order to evaluate the role of the Rho GTPase pathway on Aβ-induced neuronal death and on neuronal morphological modifications in the actin cytoskeleton, we explored the role of NSAIDS in human-differentiated neuroblastoma cells exposed to Aβ. We found that Aβ induced neurite retraction and promoted the formation of different actin-dependent structures such as stress fibers, filopodia, lamellipodia, and ruffles. In the presence of Aβ, both NSAIDs prevented neurite collapse and formation of stress fibers without affecting the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. Similar results were obtained when the downstream effector, Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632, was applied in the presence of Aβ.

In this study, 70 compounds representing several classes of pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, insect repellant, antibacterial, antidepressants, chemotherapy drugs, and X-ray contrast media compounds, were found in dreissenid mussel (zebra/quagga; Dreissena spp.) tissue samples. Overall concentration and detection frequencies varied significantly among sampling locations, site land-use categories, and sites sampled proximate and downstream of point source discharge. Verapamil, triclocarban, etoposide, citalopram, diphenhydramine, sertraline, amitriptyline, and DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) comprised the most ubiquitous PPCPs (> 50%) detected in dreissenid mussels. Among those compounds quantified in mussel tissue, sertraline, metformin, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, theophylline, zidovudine, prednisone, clonidine, 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen, iopamidol, and melphalan were detected at concentrations up to 475 ng/g (wet weight). Antihypertensives, antibiotics, and antidepressants accounted for the majority of the compounds quantified in mussel tissue. The results showed that PPCPs quantified in dreissenid mussels are occurring as complex mixtures, with 4 to 28 compounds detected at one or more sampling locations. The magnitude and composition of PPCPs detected were highest for sites not influenced by either WWTP or CSO discharge (i.e., non-WWTPs), strongly supporting non-point sources as important drivers and pathways for PPCPs detected in this study.

The edema was produced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This response was maximal within 2 h and disappeared after 24 h The minimum edema-forming dose was estimated at 0.8 μg/20 g body weight. Microscopic examination confirmed that VLV also induces skin structure alterations with collagen fiber dissociation and polynuclear infiltration, which is characteristic of edema formation. The induced edema with VLV (1 μg/paw) could be due to the release of pharmacological active substances at the site of injection. Histamine, serotonine, and arachidonate metabolites may play important roles in the vasoactive and edematic effect of VLV since pretreatment of mice with cromoglycate, cyproheptadine, ibuprofen, loratidine, and indomethacin significantly reduced the edema formation (77, 63, 57, 45, and 43 %, respectively). The obtained results demonstrate that the induced edema and vasodilatation by this venom may be triggered and maintained by different pharmacological mechanisms, since cromoglycate and cyproheptadine were the most active inhibitors of the edema.

However, long-term therapy with and improper use of NSAIDs may lead to gastrointestinal damage. Therefore, improving the therapeutic index of the existing drugs has become a priority over the past decades. Considerable attention in the field has been concentrated on metal complexes of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of complexation with zinc on the anti-inflammatory and ulcerogenic effects of ibuprofen and naproxen after single and triple intragastric administration to rats. The anti-inflammatory effect was assessed in carrageenan-induced inflammatory edema in the hind paw of male albino Wistar rats. The mucosal lesions were inspected and evaluated for gross pathology. Single administration of both the investigated complexes, namely zinc-ibuprofen and zinc-naproxen (20 mg/kg equivalent to ibuprofen and naproxen, respectively) and their parent drugs and physical mixtures with zinc hydroaspartate (ZHA doses: 16.05 and 14.37 mg/kg), caused a significant reduction of the edema after the same time from the carrageenan injection in comparison to the control groups. However, no statistically significant differences between the investigated drugs were observed after their single administration. The mean ulceration score for the mixture of ibuprofen and ZHA was statistically lower than the mean score achieved in rats after treatment with ibuprofen alone. On the other hand, triple intragastric administration of the ZHA-ibuprofen and ZHA-naproxen combination showed substantial enhancement of the anti-inflammatory activity against control groups, as well as against the parent NSAIDs. The most potent anti-inflammatory activity was demonstrated after 2 h from the carrageenan injection in animals receiving ZHA together with naproxen. The edema growth was reduced in these animals by 80.9% as compared to the control group. This result was significantly higher than the results achieved in animals receiving zinc-naproxen (50.2%) or naproxen alone (47.9%). Both NSAID complexes with zinc and mixtures with ZHA alleviated ulcerations caused by parent NSAIDs; however, the mixtures of both ibuprofen and naproxen with ZHA after triple administration were the least damaging.

Despite growing knowledge of the nature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), treatment options are still poorly defined. The safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically ibuprofen, has been openly questioned without any supporting evidence or clarity over dose, duration, or temporality of administration. This has been further conflicted by the initiation of studies to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen in improving outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients. To clarify the scientific reality, a literature search was conducted alongside considerations of the pharmacological properties of ibuprofen in order to construct this narrative review. The literature suggests that double-blind, placebo-controlled study results must be reported and carefully analysed for safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19 before any recommendations can be made regarding the use of ibuprofen in such patients. Limited studies have suggested: (i) no direct interactions between ibuprofen and SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) there is no evidence to suggest ibuprofen affects the regulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for COVID-19, in human studies. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest ibuprofen may facilitate cleavage of ACE2 from the membrane, preventing membrane-dependent viral entry into the cell, the clinical significance of which is uncertain.

A feature common to both these adverse events is a variety of vascular reactions. One approach to overcome these side effects has been the development of nitric-oxide (NO)-donating NSAIDs. The NO is considered to overcome some of these vascular reactions caused by NSAIDs. Unfortunately, the NO-NSAIDs developed so far have not had the expected benefits compared with NSAIDs alone.<h4>Objectives</h4>Using in vitro preparations it is hoped to gain insight into the vascular and smooth muscle reactions induced by NO-NSAIDs compared with NSAIDs as a basis for improving the protective responses attributed to the NO-donating properties of these drugs.<h4>Methods</h4>A range of NO-NSAIDs was synthesized based on the esterification of NSAIDs with the nitro-butoxylate as a prototype of an NO-donor. These compounds, as well as NO-donor agents and NSAIDS, were examined for their possible effects on isolated segments of digital arteries of fallow deer, which provide a robust model for determining the effects of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor activities, in comparison with those of standard pharmacological agents.<h4>Results</h4>The NO-NSAIDs were found to antagonise the smooth muscle contractions produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT). However, while almost all their parent NSAIDs had little or no effect, with the exception of the R-(-)-isomers of both ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, which caused vasodilatation, all the NO-NSAIDs tested antagonised the increase in tension produced by 5-HT.<h4>Conclusions</h4>R-(-)-ibuprofen and R-(-)-flurbiprofen, along with the nitro-butoxyl esters of the NSAIDs examined, produce relaxation of segments of deer digital artery smooth muscle in vitro.

Group-I was normal control, Group-II was ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day) inebriated group, Group-III was silymarin (25 mg/kg/day) pretreated + ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day), Group-IV was ALETZ (1000 mg/kg/day) pretreated + ibuprofen (400 mg/kg/day), and Group-V was ALETZ alone (1000 mg/kg/day) group. The duration of the administration was for five days, followed by scarifying rats on the sixth day. Later the rats were assessed for liver and intestine enzyme markers, antioxidant parameters along with histopathological changes. In addition the pro-inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels were measured using ELISA. Lastly the expression pattern of apoptotic signaling markers such as caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bcl-2 was evaluated using western blot. The results obtained from this study showed changes in levels of aforesaid parameter which presented the toxic effect of ibuprofen on liver and small intestine. Pre-treatment of ALETZ in ibuprofen-inebriated group was able to normalize the adverse effect caused due to ibuprofen. The conclusion of the study deduces that pre-treatment with ALETZ alleviates by modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in ibuprofen inebriated rats, indicating its protective mechanism.",2022,,"Panchal NK, Swarnalatha P, Prince SE.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10787-022-01052-5.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In the absence of any robust mechanistic and clinical evidence, this speculation led to confusion about the safety of ibuprofen, contributing to the so-called 'infodemic' surrounding COVID-19. A wealth of evidence has been generated in subsequent years, and this narrative review aims to consider the body of in vitro and in vivo research, observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the use of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, in COVID-19. Overall, the direction of evidence supports that NSAIDs do not increase susceptibility to infection, nor worsen disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Neither do they impact the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines. There is no basis to limit the use of NSAIDs, and doing so may deprive patients of effective self-care measures to control symptoms.",2023,,"Laughey W, Lodhi I, Pennick G, Smart L, Sanni O, Sandhu S, Charlesworth B.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-023-01309-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) has a high fatality rate, and there is no effective or standard treatment. The disease progresses rapidly and these tumors can invade the trachea and esophagus, leading to breathing and swallowing difficulties. Hence, new treatment methods are greatly needed. Ibuprofen is a common drug that can exert antitumor effects in some cancers. In this study, we demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that ibuprofen can induce ATC pyroptosis. Hence, we treated C643 and OCUT-2C ATC cells with ibuprofen and found that several dying cells presented the characteristic morphological features of pyroptosis, such as bubble-like swelling and membrane rupture, accompanied by activation of ASC and NLRP3 and cleavage of GSDMD. Along with the increased release of LDH, ibuprofen treatment promoted apoptosis and inhibited viability, invasion, and migration. However, overexpression of GSDMD significantly inhibited ibuprofen-induced pyroptosis. In vivo, research has demonstrated that thyroid tumor growth in nude mice can be suppressed by ibuprofen-induced pyroptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In this research, we explored a new mechanism by which ibuprofen inhibits ATC growth and progression and highlighted its promise as a therapeutic agent for ATC.",2024,,"Guo H, Ma R, Zhang Y, Yin K, Du G, Yin F, Li H, Wang Z, Yin D.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-023-01379-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

(Arecaceae family), a palm species known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, attributed to bioactive constituents that may facilitate wound healing and enhance dermatological health. However, the wound-healing efficacy of Veitchia arecina remains uninvestigated. This study is the first to evaluate the chemical composition, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, dermal safety, and wound-healing potential of Veitchia arecina leaf fractions in a rat model. The study aimed to elucidate their mechanism of action in tissue regeneration. The chemical composition of light petroleum ether and n-butanol soluble fractions of Veitchia arecina was analyzed via gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC-MS) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), respectively. In-vitro antioxidant (DPPH), anti-inflammatory (COX-1), and MTT assays were performed utilizing a 5% gel formulation, with povidone-iodine serving as the standard. The phytochemical analysis of the tested fractions using GLC-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS revealed the presence of sterols, terpenes, vitamin E isomers, and fatty acids in light petroleum ether soluble fraction as well as flavonoid glycosides and phenolics in n-butanol soluble fraction. Both fractions showed significant antioxidant and COX-1 inhibitory activities comparable to Trolox and ibuprofen. The topical gel formulations exhibited no dermal toxicity while improving healing by attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress, enhancing blood vessel formation, re-epithelization, formation of collagen, and restoring skin architecture.

The strong bonding results from Michael type addition reaction between an acrylate end group on a polymer and the sulfide end group of the mucin type glycoprotein. A proof of concept is provided using a polyehtylene glycol hydrogel formed in situ from polyehtylene glycol di-acrylate (PEG-DA) macromers. The ability of PEG-DA to create interactions with mucin type glycoproteins was verified using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and rheology experiments. NMR studies have detected disappearance of the PEG-DA's vinyl protons upon mucin addition, whereas rheology measurements have shown a viscosity increase. These results provide an evidence for the formation of mucin-polymer covalent bond. The ability PEG-DA to attach to mucus and promote mucoadhesion was evaluated by tensile measurements.

Physical status studies suggested that Drug-in-fiber could inhibit IBU re-crystallization, but the active ingredients were released at a relatively slow rate due to the dual-resistance of fiber mat and adhesive matrix. To overcome this shortcoming, Drug-in-adhesive/fiber was designed by coupling medicated hydrophilic pressure sensitive adhesive and IBU-loaded fiber mat.

Here we propose the use of an easily implantable bilayer polymeric patch based on poly(trimethylene carbonate-co-ε-caprolactone) (P(TMC-CL)) that combines physical guidance cues provided by electrospun aligned fibres and the delivery of ibuprofen, as a mean to reduce the inhibitory environment at the lesion site by taming RhoA activation. Bilayer patches comprised a solvent cast film onto which electrospun aligned fibres have been deposited. Both layers were loaded with ibuprofen. In vitro release (37°C, in phosphate buffered saline) of the drug from the loaded scaffolds under sink condition was found to occur in the first 24 h. The released ibuprofen was shown to retain its bioactivity, as indicated by the reduction of RhoA activation when the neuronal-like cell line ND7/23 was challenged with lysophosphatidic acid. Ibuprofen-loaded P(TMC-CL) bilayer scaffolds were successfully implanted in vivo in a dorsal hemisection rat SCI model mediating the reduction of RhoA activation after 5 days of implantation in comparison to plain P(TMC-CL) scaffolds.

In the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective properties of several COX inhibitors against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in neuroblastoma Neuro 2A (N-2A) cells in vitro and the protection against degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons after the administration of 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in C57/BL6 male mice. The data obtained demonstrate a lack of protective effects observed by COX 1-2 inhibitors ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid against MPP+ toxicity in N-2A, where piroxicam was protective in a dose dependent manner (MPP+ control: 15 +/- 2% MPP+ piroxicam: 5 mM 89 +/- 4%). The data also indicate a drop in mitochondrial oxygen (O(2)) consumption and ATP during MPP+ toxicity with no restoration of mitochondrial function concurrent to a heightened concentration of somatic ATP during piroxicam rescue. These findings indicate that the neuroprotective effects of COX inhibitors against MPP+ are not consistent, but that piroxicam may work through an unique mechanism to propel anaerobic energy metabolism. On the other hand, using mice, piroxicam (20 mg/kg) was effective against MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration in the (SNc) and loss of locomotive function in mice. Administering a 3 day pre-treatment of piroxicam (20 mg/kg) was effective in antagonizing the losses in SNc tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression, SNc DA concentration and associated anomaly in ambulatory locomotor activity.

Drug-polymer conjugates were characterized using 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Stability of the drug-conjugates was studied using free drug release through a dialysis membrane. Cellular entry of FITC-labeled HBP conjugates was studied using fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and cell supernatant was analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometer. The intracellular localization of FITC-labeled conjugates in A549 lung epithelial cells was imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Anti-inflammatory activity of the HBP-ibuprofen conjugates was estimated in vitro by measuring the concentration of prostaglandin (PGE2) using an ELISA kit.<h4>Results</h4>The average number of ibuprofen molecules conjugated per molecule of HBP was estimated to be 50 for polyol and 53 for polyglycerol. The HBP-drug conjugates did not release the drug up to 72 h in methanol, indicating the presence of stable ester bonds. Both the polymer-drug conjugates entered the cells rapidly. The conjugates were localized in the cell cytosol as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy. Within 30 min, the HBP-drug conjugates showed rapid suppression of PGE2 synthesis, whereas free ibuprofen did not show any activity. At later times, the conjugates showed comparable activity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>For the first time, we report HBP conjugates with a high drug payload.

However, the expected, progressive ""flattening"" of the concentration profiles with increasing time post-formulation removal was not observed. It was subsequently deduced, using infrared spectroscopy, that the rapid percutaneous diffusion of propylene glycol, relative to ibuprofen, resulted in the transient maintenance of a saturated drug concentration at the SC surface even after removal of the original formulation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The important role of formulation excipients in topical delivery is demonstrated, and the local disposition of cosolvents within the SC may impact significantly on drug dermatopharmacokinetics and local bioavailability.",2009,,"Nicoli S, Bunge AL, Delgado-Charro MB, Guy RH.",https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/files/363724/Nicoli_final.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Phospholipid liposomes with and without cholesterol were used to mimic the natural biological membrane.<h4>Methods</h4>The interaction of cationic and anionic drugs with ß-CD and the interaction of the drugs with liposomes were detected separately by measuring the drug mobility in ß-CD containing buffer and liposome containing buffer; respectively. Moreover, the kinetics of drug release from ß-CD and its transfer into liposomes with or without cholesterol was studied by investigation of changes in the migration behaviours of the drugs in samples, contained drug, ß-CD and liposome, at 1:1:1 molar ratio at different time intervals; zero time, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h. Lipophilic drugs such as propranolol and ibuprofen were chosen for this study, because they form complexes with ß-CD.<h4>Results</h4>The mobility of the both drug liposome mixtures changed with time to a final state. For samples of liposomal membranes with cholesterol the final state was faster reached than without cholesterol.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study confirmed that the drug release from the CD cavity and its transfer into the model membrane was more enhanced by the competitive displacement of the drug from the ß-CD cavity by cholesterol, the membrane component.

Silicone MN array moulds were fabricated from these templates and used to produce dissolving and hydrogel-forming MN arrays. These polymeric MN arrays were evaluated for their insertion in skin models and their ability to deliver model drugs (cabotegravir sodium and ibuprofen sodium) to viable layers of the skin (ex vivo and in vitro) for subsequent controlled release and/or absorption.<h4>Results</h4>The various templates obtained with 2PP 3D printing allowed the reproducible fabrication of multiple MN array moulds. The polymeric MN arrays produced were efficiently inserted into two different skin models, with sharp conical and pyramidal needles showing the highest insertion depth values (64-90% of needle height). These results correlated generally with ex vivo and in vitro drug delivery results, where the same designs showed higher drug delivery rates after 24 h of application.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This work highlights the benefits of using 2PP 3D printing to prototype variable MN array designs in a simple and reproducible manner, for their application in drug delivery.",2020,,"Cordeiro AS, Tekko IA, Jomaa MH, Vora L, McAlister E, Volpe-Zanutto F, Nethery M, Baine PT, Mitchell N, McNeill DW, Donnelly RF.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11095-020-02887-9.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

After oral administration, pomaglumetad methionil is rapidly taken up by enterocytes via PEPT1 and once absorbed, converted to LY404039 via membrane dehydropeptidase 1 (DPEP1). LY404039 is renally excreted by both glomerular filtration and active secretion and in vitro studies showed that the active secretion of LY404039 was mediated by the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1). Both clinical and in vitro data were used to build a PBPK model to predict OAT1-mediated DDIs.<h4>Results</h4>In vitro inhibitory potencies (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the known OAT inhibitors, probenecid and ibuprofen, were determined to be 4.00 and 2.63 µM, respectively. Subsequently, clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study showed probenecid reduced the renal clearance of LY404039 by 30 to 40%. The PBPK bottom-up model, predicted a renal clearance that was approximately 20% lower than the observed one. The middle-out model, using an OAT1 relative activity factor (RAF) of 3, accurately reproduced the renal clearance of LY404039 and pharmacokinetic (PK) changes of LY404039 in the presence of probenecid.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OAT1- mediated DDIs can be predicted using in vitro measured IC<sub>50</sub> and PBPK modeling.

Among them, monocyclic paracetamol and ibuprofen, widely used to treat mild and moderate pain are the most popular. Since long-term adverse effects of these xenobiotics and their biological and pharmacokinetic activity especially at environmentally relevant concentrations are better understood, degradation of such contaminants has become a major concern. Moreover, to date, conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not fully adapted to remove that kind of micropollutants. Bioremediation processes, which utilize bacterial strains with increased degradation abilities, seem to be a promising alternative to the chemical methods used so far. Nevertheless, despite the wide prevalence of paracetamol and ibuprofen in the environment, toxicity and mechanism of their microbial degradation as well as genetic background of these processes remain not fully characterized.

The treatment specific wastewater lines with the corresponding lettuce plants, differentiated into roots and shoots, were monitored for priority wastewater micropollutants, i.e., acesulfame (sweetener), caffeine (stimulant), carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole with acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (human pharmaceuticals), 1H-benzotriazole, and 4/5-methylbenzotriazole (industrial chemicals). As clearly demonstrated, conventional tertiary treatment could not efficiently clean up wastewater. Removal efficiencies ranged from 3% for carbamazepine to 100% for ibuprofen.

Alternative test models such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo have received increasing attention, with minor modifications of the fish embryo toxicity test (FET; OECD TG 236) as a tool to assess behavioral endpoints related to neurotoxicity during early developmental stages. The spontaneous tail movement assay, also known as coiling assay, assesses the development of random movement into complex behavioral patterns and has proven sensitive to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors at sublethal concentrations. The present study explored the sensitivity of the assay to neurotoxicants with other modes of action (MoAs). Here, five compounds with diverse MoAs were tested at sublethal concentrations: acrylamide, carbaryl, hexachlorophene, ibuprofen, and rotenone. While carbaryl, hexachlorophene, and rotenone consistently induced severe behavioral alterations by ~ 30 h post fertilization (hpf), acrylamide and ibuprofen expressed time- and/or concentration-dependent effects. At 37-38 hpf, additional observations revealed behavioral changes during dark phases with a strict concentration-dependency.

However, this process can introduce pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and their metabolites, posing environmental risks. This study investigates the transport behavior of four selected PhACs-caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and ibuprofen-under neutral pH conditions using column experiments in both unsaturated and saturated porous media. PhACs and a tracer solution were introduced into the system, and experimental results were simulated using the CXTFIT model to determine retardation and degradation factors. Experimental findings indicate high mobility for carbamazepine and ibuprofen across both unsaturated and saturated conditions with high recovery (> 88%) and negligible degradation (< 0.05). Ibuprofen behaved similarly identical to the tracer in unsaturated medium and with small adsorption/desorption in saturation with a retardation factor of ~ 1, while carbamazepine showed slight retardation and tailing effects showing higher persistence in the water, with high dispersion in unsaturated medium. Diclofenac significantly degrades in saturated media (45% recovery) but increases release under unsaturated conditions (91% recovery). This indicates the release of diclofenac through the vadose zone but can undergo degradation and retardation in aquifers. Caffeine exhibited high retardation and degradation, with a low recovery rate (27-30%) under both conditions, suggesting that degradation or irreversible adsorption may have occurred independently of moisture content during transport. This finding highlights the differences in mobility and degradation across unsaturated and saturated zones, posing long-term contamination risks of PhACs.

Dissolution and permeation studies performed utilizing diffusion cells and subsequently HPLC validated methods were employed to determine the API content in the acceptor solution. Accelerated stability studies were also performed at 40 °C and 70% relative humidity. The adhesive performance of the fabricated patch was evaluated utilizing loop tack adhesion tests.<h4>Results</h4>In vitro permeation experiments across both Strat-M® and human skin demonstrated that ibuprofen can easily be released from the adhesive matrix and penetrate through the studied membrane. A comparison on the permeation rates of the API across the two membranes indicated that there is not a strong correlation between the obtained data. The presence of chemical enhancers facilitated an increased flux of the API higher than observed in the basic formulation. Initial stability studies of the optimized formulation showed no degradation with respect to the drug content. Adhesion studies were also performed indicating higher values when compared with commercially available products.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study demonstrated the fabrication of an ibuprofen patch utilizing a versatile, solvent-free drug delivery platform. Upon optimization of the final system, the resulting patch offers many advantages compared to commercially available formulations including high drug loading (up to 25 wt%), good adhesion, and painless removal leaving no residues on the skin. This PSA offers many advantages over existing adhesive technology.

The apparent permeability coefficient K(p) for each of the model compounds was determined with and without miconazole nitrate. While a statistically significant penetration enhancement effect of 33% was found for testosterone, no overall statistically significant effect could be demonstrated for caffeine and ibuprofen.

The use of non-prescription analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs (AAIDs), especially paracetamol, is higher compared to pre-pandemic. This increased the AAIDs load discharged to the aqueous media through sewerage treatment plant (STP). Therefore, simple and effective treatment options for removing AAIDs from STP effluents are needed. The aim of the study was to remove AAIDs (paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, codeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen, and phenylbutazone) from STP effluents by nearly pure natural clay Na-montmorillonite. The Na-montmorillonite taken from the Ordu region in the northern part of Turkey. Surface area of the Na-montmorillonite is 99.58 m<sup>2</sup>/g and CEC is 92.40 meq/100 g. The removal efficiencies of AAIDs using Na-montmorillonite were between 82 ± 5% (ibuprofen) and 94 ± 4% (naproxen). Paracetamol was used as a model compound in kinetic and isotherm model studies. Freundlich isotherm model and the pseudo second order kinetic model were the best-fit using the obtained experimental data. Film diffusion governed its rate mechanism. The paracetamol adsorption capacity was acquired as 244 mg/g at 120 min contact time at pH 6.5 at 25 °C.

Microneedles (MN) made from dissolving polymeric matrices and loaded with the model drugs ovalbumin (OVA) and ibuprofen sodium and hydrogel-forming MN composed of ""super-swelling"" polymers and their corresponding lyophilised wafer drug reservoirs loaded with OVA and ibuprofen sodium were prepared aseptically or sterilised using commonly employed sterilisation techniques. Moist and dry heat sterilisation, understandably, damaged all devices, leaving aseptic production and gamma sterilisation as the only viable options. No measureable bioburden was detected in any of the prepared devices, and endotoxin levels were always below the US Food & Drug Administration limits (20 endotoxin units/device). Hydrogel-forming MN were unaffected by gamma irradiation (25 kGy) in terms of their physical properties or capabilities in delivering OVA and ibuprofen sodium across excised neonatal porcine skin in vitro. However, OVA content in dissolving MN (down from approximately 101.1 % recovery to approximately 58.3 % recovery) and lyophilised wafer-type drug reservoirs (down from approximately 99.7 % recovery to approximately 60.1 % recovery) was significantly reduced by gamma irradiation, while the skin permeation profile of ibuprofen sodium from gamma-irradiated dissolving MN was markedly different from their non-irradiated counterparts. It is clear that MN poses a very low risk to human health when used appropriately, as evidenced here by low endotoxin levels and absence of microbial contamination. However, if guarantees of absolute sterility of MN products are ultimately required by regulatory authorities, it will be necessary to investigate the effect of lower gamma doses on dissolving MN loaded with active pharmaceutical ingredients and lyophilised wafers loaded with biomolecules in order to avoid the expense and inconvenience of aseptic processing.",2015,,"McCrudden MT, Alkilani AZ, Courtenay AJ, McCrudden CM, McCloskey B, Walker C, Alshraiedeh N, Lutton RE, Gilmore BF, Woolfson AD, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13346-014-0211-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, for the manufacturing of formulations, continuous processes are always preferred over batch processes since they are more efficient and offer better quality of the end product. Hence, we developed topical SLN of ibuprofen (IBU) using hot melt extrusion (HME), prepared a gel formulation, and performed its in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Effect of different variables of HME equipment and materials used in SLN was optimized using design of experiment (DoE) approach. Stable 0.48% IBU SLN with particle size 60.2 ± 4.81 nm and entrapment efficiency 90.41 ± 3.46% were developed which further gelled using 1% carbopol 981A.

Hydrogels were pseudoplastic semisolids with thixotropy and pH 7.37-7.58. Microemulsions were low viscous Newtonian nanodispersions of oil droplets (13.11-15.11 nm) in water, with pH 4.01-4.64. Physical stability of the investigated systems was preserved over the 3-month storage under ambient conditions. Levetiracetam release followed zero order and Korsmeyer-Peppas models (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.99) reflecting the combined effects of drug concentration and carrier viscosity. All levetiracetam-loaded formulations produced significant reduction of hyperalgesia and paw swelling induced by carrageenan (p < 0.001). Their efficacy in exerting antihyperalgesic activity was significantly higher than that observed with the reference 5% ibuprofen hydrogel preparation (up to 6 h) (p < 0.001), while antiedematous activity was comparable with the reference product. No erythema and visible blood vessels were observed in a rat ear test.

Among the possible technological solutions, inclusion of the drug molecule within polymeric micelles, and particularly nanomicelles, has been proposed in the last years as a valid strategy. Our attention has been recently attracted by Soluplus<sup>®</sup>, an amphiphilic polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer able to form small and stable nanomicelles. The aim of this study was to characterize Soluplus<sup>®</sup> nanomicelles to enhance the apparent solubility of three model APIs, categorized in BCS class II: ibuprofen (IBU), idebenone (IDE), and miconazole (MIC). Drug-loaded Soluplus<sup>®</sup> micelles with a mean size around 60-70 nm were prepared by two methods (direct dissolution or film hydration method). The prepared nanosystems were characterized in terms of mean particle size and Zeta potential, physical stability, drug solubility, and in vitro drug release. The solubility of the tested APIs was shown to increase linearly with the concentration of graft copolymer. Soluplus<sup>®</sup> can be easily submitted to membrane filtration (0.2 µm PES or PTFE membranes), showing the potential to be sterilized by this method. Freeze-drying enabled to obtain powder materials that, upon reconstitution with water, maintained the initial micelle size.

Here, we propose a novel treatment that combines the advantages of nanomedicine and local drug delivery to target these infiltrating GBM cells. We developed an injectable lipid nanocapsule (LNC)-based formulation loaded with lauroyl-doxorubicin prodrug (DOXC<sub>12</sub>). Firstly, we demonstrated the efficacy of intratumoral administration of DOXC<sub>12</sub> in GL261 GBM-bearing mice, which extended mouse survival. Then, we formulated an injectable hydrogel by mixing the appropriate amount of prodrug with the lipophilic components of LNC. We optimized the hydrogel by incorporating cytidine-C<sub>16</sub> (CytC<sub>16</sub>) to achieve a mechanical stiffness adapted for an application in the brain post-surgery (DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup>). DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup> exhibited high DOXC<sub>12</sub> encapsulation efficiency (95%) and a size of approximately 60 nm with sustained drug release for over 1 month in vitro. DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup> exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity compared to free DOXC<sub>12</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> of 349 and 86 nM, respectively) on GL261 GBM cells and prevented the growth of GL261 spheroids cultured on organotypic brain slices. In vivo, post-surgical treatment with DOXC<sub>12</sub>-LNC<sup>CL</sup> significantly improved the survival of GL261-bearing mice. The combination of this local treatment with the systemic administration of anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen further delayed the onset of recurrences. In conclusion, our study presents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of GBM. By targeting residual GBM cells and reducing the inflammation post-surgery, we present a new strategy to delay the onset of recurrences in the gap period between surgery and standard of care therapy.",2024,,"Wang M, Bergès R, Malfanti A, Préat V, Bastiancich C.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13346-023-01456-y,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, drug delivery using hydrogel-forming MN arrays tends to be relatively slow compared to rapid drug delivery using conventional needles and syringes. Therefore, in this work, for the first time, different physical and chemical delivery enhancement methods were employed in combination with PVA-based hydrogel-forming MN arrays. Using a model drug, ibuprofen (IBU) sodium, the designed systems were assessed in terms of the extent of transdermal delivery. Iontophoresis (ITP) and heat-assisted drug delivery technology were investigated as physical permeation enhancement techniques. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that the ITP (0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>)-mediated combination strategy significantly enhanced the transdermal permeation of IBU sodium over the first 6 h (~ 5.11 mg) when compared to MN alone (~ 1.63 mg) (p < 0.05). In contrast, heat-assisted technology showed almost no promoting effect on transdermal delivery. Furthermore, IBU sodium-containing rapidly dissolving lyophilised and effervescent reservoirs, classified as chemical modification methods, were prepared. Both strategies achieved rapid and effective ex vivo IBU sodium permeation, equating to ~ 78% (30.66 mg) and ~ 71% (28.43 mg) from lyophilised and effervescent reservoirs, respectively. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that the IBU sodium plasma concentration within lyophilised and effervescent groups reached a maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) at 4 h (~ 282.15 µg/mL) and 6 h (~ 140.81 µg/mL), respectively. These strategies not only provided rapid achievement of therapeutic levels (10-15 µg/ml), but also resulted in sustained release of IBU sodium for at least 48 h, which could effectively reduce the frequency of administration, thereby improving patient compliance and reducing side effects of IBU sodium.",2025,,"Li L, Anjani QK, Hutton ARJ, Li M, Sabri AHB, Vora L, Naser YA, Tao Y, McCarthy HO, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13346-024-01737-0,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Also, lacosamide reacts with collapsin-response mediator protein 2, preventing its phosphorylation and leading to the inhibition of CGRP release in the trigeminal system.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary outcome was the difference in the serum level of CGRP-LI after three months of treatment with either lacosamide and ibuprofen or ibuprofen alone in episodic migraine patients. The secondary outcomes were assessing safety and efficacy of lacosamide in episodic migraine patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial on episodic migraine patients aged 10-55 years diagnosed according to (ICHD-3) in Kafr El-Sheikh University Hospital, Egypt. We assessed serum levels of CGRP-LI before and three months after treatment in our two groups, the lacosamide, and the control groups. We also assessed the side effects of treatment in each group, the percentage of patients who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in the migraine monthly days (MMD) frequency and the percentage of patients who achieved pain freedom within 2 h in ≥ 4 of 5 attacks in each group.<h4>Results</h4>200 episodic migraine patients completed the study. There was a statistically significantly higher reduction in the serum CGRP-LI level in the lacosamide group compared with the control group. In addition, lacosamide was well tolerated by patients. Also, the lacosamide group had statistically significant higher percentage of patients who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in the migraine monthly days (MMD) frequency and pain freedom within two hours in ≥ 4 of 5 attacks with P-values 0.002, 0.02 respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The daily use of lacosamide 50 mg Bid for three months in episodic migraine patients was associated with a significant reduction in serum CGRP-LI, better clinical outcomes regarding frequency and duration of migraine attacks, and was well tolerated by patients.

We describe a compassionate use program that offered this therapy to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.<h4>Methods</h4>NaIHS (50 mg ibuprofen, tid) was provided in addition to standard of care (SOC) to hospitalized COVID-19 patients until oxygen saturation levels of > 94% were achieved on ambient air. Patients wore a containment hood to diminish aerosolization. Outcome data from participating patients treated at multiple hospitals in Argentina between April 4 and October 31, 2020, are summarized. Results were compared with a retrospective contemporaneous control (CC) group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SOC alone during the same time frame from a subset of participating hospitals from Córdoba and Buenos Aires.<h4>Results</h4>The evolution of 383 patients treated with SOC + NaIHS [56 on mechanical ventilation (MV) at baseline] and 195 CC (21 on MV at baseline) are summarized. At baseline, NaIHS-treated patients had basal oxygen saturation of 90.7 ± 0.2% (74.3% were on supplemental oxygen at baseline) and a basal respiratory rate of 22.7 ± 0.3 breath/min. In the CC group, basal oxygen saturation was 92.6 ± 0.4% (52.1% were on oxygen supplementation at baseline) and respiratory rate was 19.3 ± 0.3 breath/min. Despite greater pulmonary compromise at baseline in the NaIHS-treated group, the length of treatment (LOT) was 9.1 ± 0.2 gs with an average length of stay (ALOS) of 11.5 ± 0.3 days, in comparison with an ALOS of 13.3 ± 0.9 days in the CC group. In patients on MV who received NaIHS, the ALOS was lower than in the CC group. In both NaIHS-treated groups, a rapid reversal of deterioration in oxygenation and NEWS2 scores was observed acutely after initiation of NaIHS therapy. No serious adverse events were considered related to ibuprofen therapy. Mortality was lower in both NaIHS groups compared with CC groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment of COVID-19 pneumonitis with inhalational nebulized NaIHS was associated with rapid improvement in hypoxia and vital signs, with no serious adverse events attributed to therapy.

Nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is attributed to physical and psychosocial factors, including lifestyle factors, obesity, and depression. Mechanical low back pain occurs related to repeated trauma to or overuse of the spine, intervertebral disks, and surrounding tissues. This causes disc herniation, vertebral compression fractures, lumbar spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, and lumbosacral muscle strain.<h4>Recent findings</h4>A systematic review of relevant literature was conducted. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two clinical trials registry databases up to 24 June 2015 were included in this review. Search terms included: low back pain, over the counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), CLBP, ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, disk herniation, lumbar spondylosis, vertebral compression fractures, spondylolisthesis, and lumbosacral muscle strain. Over-the-counter analgesics are the most frequently used first-line medication for LBP, and current guidelines indicate that over-the-counter medications should be the first prescribed treatment for non-specific LBP. Current literature suggests that NSAIDs and acetaminophen as well as antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and opioids are effective treatments for CLBP. Recent randomized controlled trials also evaluate the benefit of buprenorphine, tramadol, and strong opioids such as oxycodone.

Outcomes included postoperative Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) at different times (2, 6, 12, and 24 h), opioid consumption within 24 h post-operation, time to first rescue analgesia, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and incidence of postoperative headache or dizziness.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-nine articles involving 5987 patients were included. The network meta-analysis revealed that multimodal analgesia, nerve blocks, pregabalin, and gabapentin significantly reduced postoperative pain scores at all postoperative time points and postoperative opioid consumption compared to placebo. Tramadol, pregabalin, and gabapentin significantly extended the time to first rescue analgesia. Ibuprofen was the best intervention for reducing PONV incidence. Tramadol significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative headache or dizziness. Subgroup analysis of different doses of pregabalin and gabapentin showed that compared to placebo, pregabalin (300 mg, 150 mg) and gabapentin (600 mg, 300 mg, and 20 mg/kg) were all more effective without significant differences in efficacy between these doses. Higher doses increased the incidence of PONV and postoperative headache and dizziness, with gabapentin 300 mg having a lower adverse drug reaction (ADR) incidence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Preemptive analgesia significantly reduced postoperative pain intensity, opioid consumption, extended the time to first rescue analgesia, and decreased the incidence of PONV and postoperative headache and dizziness. Multimodal analgesia, nerve blocks, pregabalin, and gabapentin all showed good efficacy. Gabapentin 300 mg given preoperatively significantly reduced postoperative pain and ADR incidence, recommended for preemptive analgesia in LC.<h4>Trial registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD42024522185.",2024,,"Cao L, Yang T, Hou Y, Yong S, Zhou N.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-024-00647-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although previous studies have evaluated the COX inhibitory activity and selectivity of NSAIDs, none has compared COX inhibitory concentrations with the plasma concentrations of clinical doses or investigated the efficacy and adverse effects of different dosage forms. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the COX inhibitory activities and inhibition rates of clinical doses of the various NSAID formulations, especially diclofenac sodium.<h4>Methods</h4>Human blood and the drug (diclofenac sodium, celecoxib, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, or etodolac) were mixed and incubated, and the supernatant was collected and quantified the COX inhibitory activity of each drug by ELISA. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the inhibition rates at maximum plasma drug concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of clinical doses of marketed formulations. For diclofenac sodium, we also calculated the concentrations at which COX inhibition rates were 50% and 80% (IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>80</sub>).<h4>Results</h4>COX-2 inhibition rate at C<sub>max</sub> of clinical doses exceeded 50% except celecoxib 100 mg. For diclofenac sodium, the C<sub>max</sub> at the clinical doses of the oral and suppository formulations showed almost complete inhibition of COX-2 and an inhibition rate exceeding IC<sub>80</sub> for COX-1. The C<sub>max</sub> at repeated doses of the transdermal formulation showed an inhibition rate above IC<sub>80</sub> for COX-2 but below IC<sub>80</sub> for COX-1.<h4>Discussion</h4>This result explains why gastrointestinal disorders frequently occur with oral and suppository formulations of diclofenac sodium despite its relatively high COX-2 selectivity. Although the plasma drug concentration of the transdermal formulation is lower than oral and suppository formulations, it has an inhibition rate above IC<sub>50</sub> for COX-2, which is required for analgesic efficacy, and has a lower COX-1 inhibition rate than these formulations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings explain why the transdermal formulation exerts an analgesic effect despite having a lower C<sub>max</sub> than other diclofenac sodium formulations.",2025,,"Shirakawa K, Takeno M, Kuma H, Terahara T, Yamaguchi S.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-024-00687-2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Researching for novel techniques to reduce these side effects and increase patient adherence to medical treatment is of interest. The current study aims to develop an innovative nano-sized gastro-retentive drug delivery for better management of poorly water-soluble drugs.<h4>Method</h4>A non-disintegrating ibuprofen-asymmetric membrane floating nanoparticle (Ibuprofen-AMFNP) was prepared by phase inversion technique to increase the gastric residence of the drug. Powder characterization, solubility, in vitro buoyancy, effect on in vivo inflammatory markers, and polymer diffusibility studies were conducted on the prepared formulation. All UV-spectrophotometric analysis was accomplished through a fiber optic system.<h4>Results</h4>The prepared Ibuprofen-AMFNPs were in the nano range of 114.45 nm ±1.31 nm. The formulation was buoyant for 12 h in the dissolution media indicating increased gastric residence, had better solubility and powder characteristics compared to the pure drug. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an outer non-porous and inner porous asymmetric membrane. Ibuprofen-AMFNP followed Higuchi drug release kinetics (p=0.9925) and had a Fickian diffusion release mechanism (n=0.05). Polymer diffusibility study showed that the 24 h stored formulation had faster drug release with no lag time (-923.08 nm/h) compared to a fresh formulation (2526.32 nm/h). The prepared nano-formulation showed a higher percentage of anti-inflammatory (85.144%) effect compared to the pure drug (78.336%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen-AMFNP is envisioned to help reduce drug-related GI side effects, improve drug delivery, and thereby increase patient adherence to medical treatment.",2021,,"Samuel BA, Mohammed BI, Philip AK.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8602594,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Furthermore, <i>Hammada elegans</i> Botsch. (Chenopodiaceae) a xerophytic plant popularly known as (Ajram) is widely spread perennial shrub in Laghouat region and it is traditionally used to treat inflammation and diabete. Then, the objective of this work is to study for the first time the in vivo anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and acute toxicity effects of acetonic, methanolic and aqueous <i>Hammada elegans</i> Botsch extracts.<h4>Methods</h4>The acute toxicity test was performed according to the OECD method using single increasing doses (50-1500 mg/kg bw). The anti-inflammatory effect is investigated in Wistar rats by using the rat paw edema assay. The antidiabetic activity was evaluated in vivo using three tests: short-term test (in non-diabetic rats), starch-induced hyperglycemia test (in non-diabetic rats) and long-term alloxan test (experimental diabetes).<h4>Results</h4>The acute toxicity results show no deaths in rats and no clinical signs of toxicity. The anti-inflammatory effects showed that all extracts significantly inhibit rat paw edema (EC<sub>50</sub> less than 345.51 ± 0.29 mg/kg bw). Therefore, the acetonic extract (EC<sub>50</sub> = 157.45 ± 0.33 mg/kg bw) had the more active anti-inflammatory activity than that of the standard inhibitor ""Ibuprofen"". In addition, the evaluation of the antidiabetic activities by three tests shows that: in, in the short-term test, there was no important decrease in normal rats glucose rate, while in the starch-induced hyperglycemia test, the aqueous extract decreased significantly hyperglycemia (57.21 ± 1.24 mg AEAC / kg bw) compared to all tested extracts. While in the long-term test, the acetone extract significantly decreased hyperglycemia (9.18 ± 0.72 mg GEAC / kg bw) compared to all the tested extracts.<h4>Conclusions</h4><i>Hammada elegans</i> Botsch extracts seem to have therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of the inflammation and diabetes.",2021,,"Asseli B, Djeridane A, Mahfoudi R, Yousfi M.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40200-021-00762-x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Increased usage of these chemicals poses a serious risk to ecology and human health due to their leakage into surface waters. In the present study, carbide derived carbon (CDC) was used for the first time as a new adsorbent to remove ibuprofen from synthetic water and wastewater effluent.<h4>Methods</h4>The morphology, chemical composition, surface area and surface charge of the CDC particles were investigated using the transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, BET analysis and zeta potential measurements. The effects of CDC dosage, temperature, initial pH and agitation speed on the adsorption process were examined by using batch adsorption experiments. Moreover, the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and isotherms were investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Adsorption and kinetic equilibrium data demonstrate that the adsorption of ibuprofen onto the CDC obeys the Langmuir isotherm model and the kinetics follow the pseudo-2nd order mechanism. The thermodynamic results reveal that ibuprofen adsorption is endothermic and spontaneous. The ibuprofen removal by CDC was mainly controlled by the electrostatic forces at high pH of the feed solution and by the dispersive interactions in acidic media. The ibuprofen removal is promoted at high temperature, high agitation speed and low pH. The highest adsorption capacity of ibuprofen onto the CDC was 367 mg/g at pH 3. Furthermore, the CDC efficiently removed ibuprofen from spiked treated sewage effluent.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The obtained data indicate that the CDC provides a fast and efficient adsorptive removal of ibuprofen both from a model aqueous solution and treated sewage effluent.",2020,,"Almanassra IW, Kochkodan V, Ponnusamy G, Mckay G, Ali Atieh M, Al-Ansari T.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40201-020-00554-0,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Its efficacy and safety profile have led to its increasing use in paediatric care, even without medical prescription. However, an increase of suspected adverse reactions to ibuprofen has been noted in concomitance with the raised, often medically unsupervised, consumption of the drug. The purpose of this work was a critical review of the paediatric literature over the last 15 years on side effects and adverse events associated with ibuprofen, in order to highlight circumstances associated with higher risks and to promote safe and appropriate use of this drug. The literature from 2000 to date demonstrates that gastrointestinal events are rare, but (when they occur) include both upper and lower digestive tract lesions. Dehydration plays an important role in triggering renal damage, so ibuprofen should not be given to patients with diarrhoea and vomiting, with or without fever. Likewise, ibuprofen should never be administered to patients who are sensitive to it or to other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated in neonates and in children with wheezing and persistent asthma and/or during varicella. Most of the analysed studies reported adverse events when ibuprofen was being used for fever symptoms or flu-like syndrome. Ibuprofen should not be used as an antipyretic, except in rare cases.

The primary endpoint was the time-weighted sum of pain relief and pain intensity difference scores from 0 to 8 h after dosing (SPRID[4]<sub>0-8</sub>). Time to meaningful pain relief (TMPR), duration of pain relief, and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 394 patients were randomized. All active treatments were superior to placebo for SPRID[4]<sub>0-8</sub> (all p < 0.001) but not significantly different from ibuprofen 400 mg. Median TMPR with FDCs and ibuprofen (44.5-54.1 and 56.2 min, respectively) was faster than with placebo (> 720 min; all p < 0.001 vs. placebo). Duration of pain relief was similar with the FDCs and ibuprofen 400 mg (9.7 -11.1 h) and longer than with placebo (1.6 h; all p < 0.001). AE incidence was comparable with all treatments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Each IBU/APAP FDC provided analgesic efficacy comparable to that with ibuprofen 400 mg and superior to that with placebo. Each FDC provided MPR in < 1 h, duration of pain relief > 9 h, and tolerability similar to that with ibuprofen and placebo.

Internal discolourations are due to the properties of the restorative materials. External discolourations can be associated with frequent consumption of food and beverages and the use of suspensions or syrups containing colourants/additives. Fluoride varnish application has an important place in preventive dentistry. The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of fluoride varnish application on the colour change on polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials caused by the use of various paediatric drugs.<h4>Methods</h4>Two hundred ten discs were prepared from polyacid-modified composite resin material and divided into two groups: flouride varnish was applied to one group and flouride varnish was not applied to the other group. The groups were further divided into seven subgroups and the samples were kept in artificial saliva, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, clarithromycin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and iron supplement drug solutions. The colour change values of the discs were measured using a spectrophotometer device before immersion in the drug solutions and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days after the immersion. The obtained data were calculated and statistically evaluated using IBM SPSS V23 software.<h4>Results</h4>It was found that the application of fluoride varnish in the iron supplement drug group prevented the colour change of the polyacid-modified composite resins for 28 days. In the amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and paracetamol groups, the fluoride varnish did not prevent colour change in the polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials at the end of the 14th day.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is thought that fluoride varnish application may be beneficial as a preservative in the colour change of polyacid-modified composite resins due to the use of various paediatric drugs, and this protective feature may be effective for a specific period of time.",2024,,"Çevik N, Hazar Bodrumlu E.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40368-024-00894-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The inhibitory activity of ibuprofen as a single agent was determined according to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, while the effect of ibuprofen combined with amphotericin B, itraconazole, or terbinafine was estimated by microdilution checkerboard methodology. The ultrastructural alterations of S. schenckii after exposure to the combination of ibuprofen and amphotericin B were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and flow cytometry analysis. As a single agent, ibuprofen inhibited Sporothrix growth with a MIC median of 256 μg/mL, while the MIC medians of ibuprofen in combination with antifungals were 16 μg/mL and 128 μg/mL. The MIC values of amphotericin B, itraconazole, and terbinafine were reduced when isolates were co-incubated with ibuprofen, mainly the polyene. The major alteration after treatment with the ibuprofen/amphotericin B combination was the increase in the presence of filamentous forms and high membrane damage with loss of plasma membrane integrity. In summary, we demonstrated that ibuprofen increases the in vitro activity of antifungals, mainly amphotericin B, against S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii.

Immunological system activation was shown to accelerate kidney damage even in inherited disorders. The kynurenine pathway is the main route of tryptophan degradation. A metabolite of kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), produced by kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), was reported to affect fluid and electrolyte balance as a result of natriuresis induction. The accumulation of KYNA was shown in patients with impaired kidney function and its level was related to the degree of kidney damage. Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are well-known analgesics and most of them demonstrate an anti-inflammatory effect. Their main mechanism of action is prostaglandin synthesis blockade, which is also responsible for their nephrotoxic potential. Since the KYN pathway is known to remain under immunological system control, the purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of 9 COX inhibitors on KYNA production together with KATs' activity in rat kidneys in vitro.<h4>Methods</h4>Experiments were carried out on kidney homogenates in the presence of L-KYN and the selected compound in 6 various concentrations.<h4>Results</h4>Among the examined COX inhibitors only acetaminophen did not change KYNA production in rat kidneys in vitro. Additionally, acetaminophen did not affect the activity of KAT I and KAT II, whereas acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen inhibited only KAT II. The remaining COX inhibitors decreased the activity of both KATs in rat kidneys in vitro.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study provides novel mechanisms of COX inhibitors action in the kidney, with possible implications for the treatment of kidney diseases.",2023,,"Zakrocka I, Załuska W.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43440-023-00460-w.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We explored modifications of ibuprofen (IBU) by forming ionic pairs using amino acid alkyl esters to enhance solubility without compromising the ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2). We comprehensively evaluated the pharmacological properties of the IBU derivatives, focusing on antioxidant activity (based on the ability to scavenge DPPH and ABTS), biocompatibility (using human dermal fibroblasts), and COX inhibitory potential. The antioxidant activity assays significantly enhanced DPPH scavenging activity for several IBU derivatives, particularly [L-SerOiPr][IBU], suggesting potential therapeutic benefits. There was enhanced cell viability with select derivatives, indicating possible stimulatory effects on cellular proliferation. Finally, predominant COX-1 inhibition across derivatives was consistent with IBU's profile.

These responses are anteceded by mobilization of membrane-associated calcium, monitored as a decrease in fluorescence of cells preloaded with chlortetracycline (CTC). We studied the effects, both in vitro and in vivo, of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (aspirin, indomethacin, ibuprofen and piroxicam) on these neutrophil responses to three stimuli: a chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP); a tumor promotor, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA); and a lectin, concanavalin A (Con A). The effects of these drugs were compared with those of two polyenoic inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism: eicosatrienoic acid (ETI) and eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA). The pattern of inhibition of neutrophil functions varied both with inhibitor and the nature of the stimulus. Thus, aspirin, piroxicam, ETYA and ETI inhibited neutrophil aggregation, degranulation, and O2- generation in response to FMLP, whereas ibuprofen inhibited only aggregation and degranulation and indomethacin only inhibited aggregation. None of the agents inhibited aggregation or degranulation induced by PMA or Con A: only piroxicam inhibited O2- generation in response to PMA or Con A. ETI and ibuprofen inhibited decrements of CTC fluorescence induced by FMLP, but whereas ETI inhibited the CTC response to PMA or Con A, ibuprofen was without effect. The agents had varying effects on binding of the stimulus [( 3H]FMLP, [3H]Con A), but these did not correlate with neutrophil responses to the ligands. Neutrophils from subjects taking therapeutic doses of ibuprofen, indomethacin, or piroxicam showed profiles of inhibited responses to FMLP similar to those observed with these agents in vitro. These data suggest that, although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may inhibit discrete neutrophil functions both in vitro and in vivo, their effects do not duplicate those of polyenoic inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism. Moreover, since the susceptibility of neutrophils differed not only with respect to each inhibitor, but also to the stimulus, it is unlikely that all neutrophil responses are necessarily linked by a common pathway that is blocked by inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism.",1984,,"Kaplan HB, Edelson HS, Korchak HM, Given WP, Abramson S, Weissmann G.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(84)90228-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The accumulation of intravenously-injected 125I-albumin was used to measure oedema. Two peptides were used to increase microvascular permeability: C5a des Arg, whose action is dependent on circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and bradykinin which acts directly on vascular endothelial cells. The peptides were injected intradermally together with either arachidonic acid or PGE2 to potentiate oedema formation. To study the cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity of ibuprofen, the effects of the mediators were potentiated by addition of arachidonic acid. To investigate whether the drug had effects independent of cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, PGE2 was used to potentiate responses. Both local and intravenous ibuprofen suppressed oedema induced by bradykinin + arachidonic acid and C5a des Arg + arachidonic acid, which is consistent with suppression of cyclo-oxygenase in the skin. Local ibuprofen had no effect on responses to bradykinin + PGE2 or C5a des Arg + PGE2. Intravenous ibuprofen had no significant effect on responses to bradykinin + PGE2 but, in contrast, had a marked inhibitory effect on responses to C5a des Arg + PGE2. It is concluded that, in addition to its known cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory activity, ibuprofen can inhibit inflammatory oedema at clinically-relevant doses by an action on circulating poly-morphonuclear leukocytes. These observations in vivo appear to be related to other observations on the effects of ibuprofen on polymorphonuclear leukocyte function in vitro and ex vivo.

A molecular mechanism distinct from that of alpha 2-adrenergic agonists.,"To evaluate the regulation and effects of pancreatic islet lipoxygenase, adult rat islets were permeabilized, using digitonin or staphylococcal alpha-toxin, and then were studied in a medium simulating an intracellular milieu at fixed ambient concentrations of Ca2+. Permeabilized islets retained 12-lipoxygenase activity, as indicated by conversion of tritiated arachidonic acid to a predominant peak of [3H]12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE); this activity was inhibited (89-98%) by the lipoxygenase blockers nordihydroguaiaretic acid (35 microM), BW755c (250 microM) or ETYA (35 microM). Lesser amounts of compounds coeluting with 15- and 11-HETE (but little or no 5-HETE) were formed; however, 11-HETE (and possibly some 15-HETE) was probably synthesized (at least in part) via cyclooxygenase, as suggested by the partial synthesis blockade induced by 50 microM ibuprofen. The production of 12-HETE did not require the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+ or ATP; it also was not stimulated by addition of cyclic AMP, a phorbol ester, or calmodulin. However, it was augmented modestly by provision of a basal cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration of 60-80 nM, with no further increase at physiologically elevated levels of 260-530 nM. Elevations in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations induced insulin release which was inhibited by cooling, epinephrine or protein kinase inhibitors and, therefore, was exocytotic in nature. Lipoxygenase inhibitors blocked this insulinotropic effect of calcium at submaximal or saturating Ca2+ concentrations (with or without its potentiation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C) by 53-82%. However, they did not reduce the Ca2+-independent secretory effects (at subnanomolar Ca2+ concentrations) of the phorbol ester alone. Similar results were seen using dibutyryl cyclic AMP to activate protein kinase A. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonists epinephrine or clonidine inhibited Ca2+-, TPA- or cyclic AMP-induced insulin release without reducing HETE formation. We conclude that (1) islet lipoxygenase is constitutively expressed and is not physiologically regulated by alpha 2-adrenergic agonism, Ca2+ or protein kinases; (2) lipoxygenase modulates insulin release; HETE production is not merely an epiphenomenon reflecting the activation (or inhibition) of exocytotic secretion; (3) islet lipoxygenase inhibitors reduce insulin secretion, at least in part, by blocking the direct effects of Ca2+ on exocytosis and/or its synergism with Ca2+-binding proteins such as protein kinase C; and (4) these same inhibitors do not directly poison protein kinase C or A, or the exocytotic apparatus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1989,,Metz SA.,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(89)90421-8,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Mediation of these effects by thromboxane A2 (TXA2) inhibition was discounted since under the same experimental conditions, adrenaline did not stimulate TXA2 synthesis and A23187-stimulated TXA2 synthesis was only marginally inhibited by concentrations of ibuprofen and indomethacin that inhibited 45Ca2+ uptake by 50%.

Relaxation in response to BK seems due to a direct action on the longitudinal smooth muscle since effects were demonstrable in the presence of ibuprofen, mepyramine, atropine, guanethidine (all 1 microM), hexamethonium (10 microM) and TTX (0.3 microM). Receptors involved are of the B2 subtype since agonists and antagonists active at B1 receptors were essentially inactive, and the B2 receptor antagonist Lys,Lys-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK was a potent competitive antagonist of BK-induced relaxation (pKB of 7.2 +/- 0.1). The activity of both BK and the antagonist were unchanged by the presence of peptidase inhibitors including the carboxypeptidase inhibitor DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (mergetpa, 10 microM), which prevents conversion of BK analogues to des-Arg9-B1-active products. In high-K+ solution, BK (0.1-10 microM) produced concentration-related increases in 86Rb efflux. Both this permeability increase in high-K+ solution, and the relaxant responses in Krebs solution, were inhibited by low concentrations (10-100 nM) of apamin, as well as the B2 receptor antagonist Lys,Lys-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK (1 microM). These results are compatable with the proposal that BK-evoked relaxation of the rat duodenum is mediated via a subset of B2 receptors for which the antagonist Lys,Lys-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK has a high affinity, and results from stabilisation of the smooth muscle membrane through the opening of apamin-sensitive 86Rb-permeable calcium-activated K+ channels.",1991,,"Hall JM, Morton IK.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(91)90041-n,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In the fibrin plate assay of plasmin-induced fibrinolysis, one nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAI) drug, ibuprofen, was demonstrated to antagonize the inhibition of fibrinolysis. The antagonistic activity of ibuprofen appears unrelated to its NSAI drug activity because other NSAI drugs such as indomethacin and tolmetin have minimal antagonistic activity.

AA was shown to act in a time- and dose-dependent manner to stimulate testosterone production. AA in the range of 10(-5) to 10(-4) M increased testosterone production within 2 hr and had a maximal effect by 9 hr. The magnitude of the testosterone response to AA was similar to that observed when ovarian follicles were incubated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Ovarian follicles incubated with AA and either hCG or forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator) produced more testosterone than follicles incubated with either of these compounds alone. The actions of AA on testosterone production were completely blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin or ibuprofen) and were reduced by 50% by the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Phospholipase C was far more effective than phospholipase A2 in the stimulation of testosterone production.

PGD2 depressed neurotransmission throughout a broad range of stimulus free quencies, apparently by presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine release. PGE2 enhanced the effects of both nerve stimulation and exogenous norepinephrine in intact preparations but only depressed the effects of exogenous norepinephrine in the chronically denervated nictitating membrane, suggesting that part of the effect of PGE2 on neurotransmission was presynaptic. When norepinephrine reuptake was blocked by desipramine, PGE2 still enhanced neurotransmission. Indomethacin, but not other cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, meclofenamic acid), inhibited the response of the nictitating membrane to nerve stimulation without depressing the effects of exogenous norepinephine. Curiously, indomethacin, but again not other cyclooxygenase inhibitors, specifically antagonized the ability of PGE2 to enhance nerve transmission. These results further characterize the pharmacological effects of PGE2 and PGD2 at the nictitating membrane. The lack of effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests that neither endogenous PGE2 or PGD2 play a functional role at this synapse.

Inhibition of granule exocytosis and oxygen radical generation at ibuprofen concentrations less than 5 mg/ml was not due to drug cytotoxicity since release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase was not affected by ibuprofen. In contrast to neutrophil responses mediated by C5a or FMLP, ibuprofen did not inhibit either enzyme release or superoxide anion generation by neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. Ibuprofen did not function as an oxygen radical scavenger in a cell-free system in which superoxide anion was generated by the aerobic action of xanthine oxidase on hypoxanthine. Ibuprofen also inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion both directed migration (chemotaxis) and stimulated random migration (chemokinesis) of neutrophils exposed to either FMLP or C5a. Inhibition of neutrophil adherence to plastic surfaces and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells was equally effective when the neutrophils were treated with ibuprofen before stimulation with FMLP or phorbol myristate acetate. The inhibitory effects of ibuprofen pretreatment of neutrophils could not be overcome by addition of prostaglandins E1 or E2 (0.3-300 nM). These results demonstrate that ibuprofen is capable of suppressing many functions thought to be important in neutrophil-mediated acute pulmonary inflammatory processes.

Once activated, the suppressor cells inhibit the in vitro antibody synthesis of cocultured syngeneic splenocytes stimulated by T cell dependent antigens. In this paper we have examined the possibility that prostaglandins are involved in the activation process. Inducer and precursor cells were cultured in Marbrook vessels in chambers separated by dialysis membranes. Using this procedure, suppressor cells were activated following 12 h of culture but were not detectable after 6 h. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin, acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), and ibuprofen all prevented the activation of suppressor cells in a dose dependent manner. Prostaglandin (PG) E1, but not PGF2a or PGD2, restored the activation of suppressor cells in cultures containing the cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Restoration of suppressor cell activation was seen with 1 X 10(-7) M PGE1 but no activation of suppressor cells was seen in control cultures containing up to 1 X 10(-5) M PGE1. In addition, cultured spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice did not secrete higher quantities of PGE than did cells from age and sex matched normal mice.

Indomethacin completely prevented the mortality and hepatic damage elicited by phalloidin as judged by morphologic analysis and serum AST and ALT release.

HCT-8 cells showed typical epithelial cell morphology, with microvilli and intercellular junctional complexes, and formed domes, consistent with transepithelial fluid secretion. The cells express three intestinal brush-border enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and alpha-glucosidase), and adenylate cyclase can be stimulated with vasoactive intestinal peptide. The toxicity of eight non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; indomethacin, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, sulindac, aspirin, phenylbutazone and naproxen) were assessed using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays. The MTT assay was consistently a more sensitive measure of NSAID-induced toxicity, which suggests that perturbation of mitochondrial function may be an early event in NSAID-induced cellular damage. Comparing the rankings observed in acute studies in the rat in vivo with those observed with HCT-8 cells, there are some general agreements. Indomethacin, a potent ulcerogen in vivo, was consistently among the most toxic in vitro, while aspirin and phenylbutazone have comparatively low rankings in vitro and in vivo. In man, with chronic administration, indomethacin is again ranked as a potent ulcerogen, as is aspirin, in contrast to the in vitro data with HCT-8. Therefore, NSAID-induced toxicity in HCT-8 cells assessed by the MTT or neutral red assays, can only partially predict toxicity in vivo, which suggests that local gastro-intestinal environmental factors, such as luminal acidity, may play a role in vivo.

Dependence in arachidonic acid, phospholipase A2, calcium availability and membrane depolarization.","Isolated hippocampal mossy fiber synaptosomes were used to characterize control mechanisms of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) synthesis at a central mammalian synapse. Exogenous arachidonic acid stimulated the dose-dependent synthesis of PGF2 alpha, as did the addition of phospholipase A2 or the activation of endogenous phospholipase A2. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors attenuated prostaglandin synthesis, but phospholipase C inhibitors had no effect. However, a diglyceride kinase inhibitor reduced PGF2 alpha accumulation. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen eliminated PGF2 alpha production, while the lipoxygenase inhibitors baicalein and NDGA reduced PGF2 alpha accumulation. The CA(2+)-ionophore-dependent stimulation of PGF2 alpha synthesis was abolished by Cd2+ or Ni2+. Further more, PGF2 alpha production appeared to be dependent on Ca2+ influx via L-type, but not N- or T-type, voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Membrane depolarization with KC1, veratridine or 4-aminopyridine stimulated the synthesis of PGF2 alpha. This depolarization-dependent stimulation of PGF2 alpha synthesis was attenuated by L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel blockers, phospholipase A2 inhibitors, a K+ channel activator and a Na+ channel blocker. The activation of protein kinase C also led to a reduction of PGF2 alpha accumulation in depolarized nerve endings.

However, inflammatory responses caused by degradation of barrier materials remain a major challenge. This study aimed to fabricate electrospun composite fibrous membranes based on drug-loaded modified mesoporous silica (MMS) and poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA). Using a co-solvent-based electrospinning method ibuprofen (IBU)-loaded MMS was successfully and uniformly encapsulated in the PLLA fibers. The electrospun PLLA-MMS-IBU composite fibrous membranes showed significantly lower initial burst release (6% release in the first 12h) compared with that of electrospun PLLA-IBU fibrous membranes (46% release in the first 12h) in in vitro release tests. Moreover, the release from PLLA-MMS-IBU was also for significantly longer than that from PLLA-IBU (100 vs. 20days). In animal studies both PLLA-IBU and PLLA-MMS-IBU showed improved anti-adhesion properties and anti-inflammatory effects compared with PLLA fibrous membrane alone 4weeks after implantation. Further, animals implanted with PLLA-MMS-IBU for 8weeks showed the lowest inflammation and best recovery compared with those implanted with PLLA-IBU and PLLA, most likely as a result of its long-term IBU release profile.

To this end, we fabricated core-shell nanofibrous membranes (CSNMs) with embedded silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/poly(caprolactone) (PCL) shell and hyaluronic acid (HA)/ibuprofen in the core. HA imparted a lubrication effect for smooth tendon gliding and reduced fibroblast attachment, while Ag NPs and ibuprofen functioned as anti-infection and anti-inflammation agents, respectively. CSNMs with a PEG/PCL/Ag shell (PPA) and HA core containing 0% (H/PPA), 10% (HI10/PPA), 30% (HI30/PPA) and 50% (HI50/PPA) ibuprofen were fabricated through co-axial electrospinning and assessed through microscopic, spectroscopic, thermal, mechanical and drug release analyses. Considering nutrient passage through the barrier, the microporous CSNMs exerted the same barrier effect but drastically increased the mass transfer coefficients of bovine serum albumin compared with the commercial anti-adhesive membrane SurgiWrap®. Cell attachment/focal adhesion formation of fibroblasts revealed effective reduction of initial cell attachment on the CSNM surface with minimum cytotoxicity (except HI50/PPA). The anti-bacterial effect against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was verified to be due to the Ag NPs in the membranes. In vivo studies using H/PPA and HI30/PPA CSNMs and SurgiWrap® in a rabbit flexor tendon rupture model demonstrated the improved efficacy of HI30/PPA CSNMs in reducing inflammation and tendon adhesion formation based on gross observation, histological analysis and functional assays. We conclude that HI30/PPA CSNMs can act as a multifunctional barrier membrane to prevent peritendinous adhesion after tendon surgery.<h4>Statement of significance</h4>A multi-functional anti-adhesion barrier membrane that could reduce fibroblasts attachment and penetration while simultaneously prevent post-surgical infection and inflammation is urgently needed. To this end, we prepared electrospun core-shell hyaluronic acid + ibuprofen/polyethylene glycol + polycaprolactone + Ag nanoparticles nanofibrous membranes by co-axial electrospinning as an ideal anti-adhesive membrane. The core-shell structure could meet the need of a desirable anti-adhesion barrier through release of ibuprofen and Ag nanoparticles to reduce infection and inflammation while hyaluronic acid can reduce fibroblasts adhesion.

The high surface area of the PGX-processed alginate scaffold facilitates >8 wt% loading of ibuprofen into the scaffold and controlled in vitro ibuprofen release over 12-24 h. In vivo burn wound healing assays demonstrate significantly accelerated healing with ibuprofen-loaded PGX-alginate/calcium scaffolds relative to both hydrogel-only and untreated controls, demonstrating the combined benefits of ibuprofen delivery to suppress inflammation as well as the capacity of the PGX-alginate/calcium hydrogel to maintain wound hydration and facilitate continuous calcium release to the wound. The use of PGX technology to produce highly porous scaffolds with increased surface areas, followed by adsorptive precipitation of a hydrophobic drug onto the scaffolds, offers a highly scalable method of creating medicated wound dressings with high drug loadings. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: While medicated hydrogel-based wound dressings offer clear advantages in accelerating wound healing, the inherent incompatibility between conventional hydrogels and many poorly water-soluble drugs of relevance in wound healing remains a challenge. Herein, we leveraged supercritical fluids-based strategies to both process and subsequently impregnate alginate, followed by post-crosslinking to form a hydrogel, to create a very high surface area alginate hydrogel scaffold loaded with high hydrophobic drug contents (here, >8 wt% ibuprofen) without the need for any pore-forming additives.

Exclusion criteria were serum aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >200 mg/dL, serum creatinine >1.0 mg/dL, infectious hepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, age <18 years, or current incarceration. Our primary outcome was the duration of severe-range hypertension, defined as the time (in hours) from delivery to the last blood pressure ≥160/110 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes were time from delivery to last blood pressure ≥150/100 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure, need for antihypertensive medication at discharge, prolongation of hospital stay for blood pressure control, postpartum use of short-acting antihypertensives for acute blood pressure control, and opioid use for breakthrough pain. We analyzed all outcome data according to intention-to-treat principles.<h4>Results</h4>We assessed 154 women for eligibility, of whom 100 met entry criteria, agreed to participate, and were randomized to receive postpartum ibuprofen or acetaminophen for first-line pain control. Seven patients crossed over or did not receive their allocated study drug, and 93 completed the study protocol in their assigned groups. We found no differences in baseline characteristics between groups, including mode of delivery, body mass index, parity, race, chronic hypertension, and maximum blood pressure prior to delivery. We did not find a difference in the duration of severe-range hypertension in the ibuprofen vs acetaminophen groups (35.3 vs 38.0 hours, P = .30). There were no differences between groups in the secondary outcome measures of time from delivery to last blood pressure ≥150/100 mm Hg, postpartum mean arterial pressure, maximum postpartum systolic or diastolic blood pressures, any postpartum blood pressure ≥160/110 mm Hg, short-acting antihypertensive use for acute blood pressure control, length of postpartum stay, need to extend postpartum stay for blood pressure control, antihypertensive use at discharge, or opioid use for inadequate pain control. In a subgroup analysis of patients who experienced severe-range hypertension, the mean time to blood pressure control in the acetaminophen group was 68.4 hours and ibuprofen group was 56.7 hours (P = .26). At 6 weeks postpartum, there were no differences between groups in the rates of obstetric triage visits, hospital readmissions, continued opioid use, or continued antihypertensive use.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The first-line use of ibuprofen rather than acetaminophen for postpartum pain did not lengthen the duration of severe-range hypertension in women with preeclampsia with severe features.",2018,,"Blue NR, Murray-Krezan C, Drake-Lavelle S, Weinberg D, Holbrook BD, Katukuri VR, Leeman L, Mozurkewich EL.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9097787,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this article, ibuprofen lipid microspheres of octadecanol and glycerin monostearate were prepared to mask the undesirable taste of ibuprofen via three kinds of spray congealing processes, namely, air-cooling, water-cooling and citric acid solution-cooling. The stereoscopic and internal structures of ibuprofen microspheres were quantitatively analyzed by synchrotron radiation X-ray micro-computed tomography (SR-µCT) to establish the relationship between the preparation process and microsphere architectures. It was found that the microstructure and morphology of the microspheres were significantly influenced by preparation processes as the primary factors to determine the release profiles and taste-masking effects. The sphericity of ibuprofen microspheres congealed in citric acid solution was higher than that of other two and its morphology was more regular than that being congealed in air or distilled water, and the contact angles between congealing media and melted ibuprofen in octadecanol and glycerin monostearate well demonstrated the structure differences among microspheres of three processes which controlled the release characteristics of the microspheres. The structure parameters like porosity, sphericity, and radius ratio from quantitative analysis were correlated well with drug release behaviors.

Inspired by the ""antiskid tires"" with complex chiral patterns, mesoporous silica nanoparticles AT-R@CMSN exhibiting geometrical chiral structure were designed to improve the surface/interface roughness in nanoscale, and employed as the hosting system for insoluble drugs nimesulide (NMS) and ibuprofen (IBU). Once performing the delivery tasks, AT-R@CMSN with rigid skeleton protected the loaded drug and reduced the irritation of drug on gastrointestinal tract (GIT), while their porous structure deprived drug crystal and improved drug release.

The aetiological diagnosis of severe non-immediate reactions is difficult, and the value of current allergological testing is not well defined in these cases. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, the empirical risk of drugs to trigger SJS/TEN or DRESS, and the in vivo and in vitro testing of the suspect drug. Skin biopsy confirms that the clinical diagnosis and delayed hypersensitivity tests, especially the patch test and the lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT), may be important to confirm the aetiological diagnosis, in our cases emphasising the latter.

The rats were randomized into 5 groups of 8 and a sham group of 6. The 40 rats in the study groups were anaesthetised with 60 mg/kg of ketamine, then 0.25 ml ibuprofen (25 mg) was injected to the right knee joint of each rat (ibuprofen group) and 0.25 ml 0.9% saline to the left knee joint as the control group. To the 6 rats in the sham group, only puncture was applied to both knee joints. The rats in each of the 5 study groups were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21 respectively. The histomorphologic changes were graded on a 6-point scale regarding inflammation of the synovia, cartilage tissue, and subchondral bone. Inflammation scores were compared using the Mann Whitney U-test and comparisons of the sacrifice day and drug used were evaluated with the Kruskal Wallis test.

Inspired by the iron ion catalyzed auto-oxidation of aqueous SO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., Fe(II)/sulfite process), that generates intermediary sulfate radical able to oxidize organic compounds, we propose a feasible energy-water-environment nexus by using waste SO<sub>2</sub> to alleviate water contamination. As a demonstration, electrolysis is used to assist Fe(II)/sulfite (i.e., electro/Fe(II)/sulfite) process to enhance contaminant removals. Results showed 91% of 10 μM ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) contaminant at neutral pH was removed, due to sulfate radical oxidation. Synergy mechanisms of electro/Fe(II)/sulfite process were revealed. Moreover, the electro/Fe(II)/sulfite process could effectively degrade contaminants in water bodies from fields, indicating its promising practical application. Energetic analysis indicated that electric treatment cost is 8.65 cent/m<sup>3</sup>, and is affordable by most water treatment plants.

Therefore, we established an ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated drug co-delivery system (Ibu&FK@RNPs), which can target the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and response to the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD. RAGE is highly and specifically expressed on the lesion neurovascular unit of AD, this property helps to improve targeting specificity of the system and reduce unselective distribution in normal brain. Meanwhile, these two drugs can be specifically released in astrocytes of AD lesion in response to high levels of ROS. As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the quantity of A<i>β</i> plaques was decreased. Neurotoxicity was also alleviated with structural regeneration and functional recovery of neurons. Besides, the neuroinflammation dominated by NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway was significantly inhibited with decreased NF-<i>κ</i>B and IL-1<i>β</i> in the brain.

A high concentration of this kind of drug is discarded in the urine, reaching the effluents of rivers, lakes, and seas. These medicines have brought serious problems for the flora and, especially, the ecosystems' fauna. This paper presents the results of removing diclofenac, ibuprofen, and paracetamol in an aqueous solution, using <i>Sargassum</i> spp. from the Caribbean coast. The study consisted of mixing each drug in an aqueous solution with functionalized <i>Sargassum spp</i> in a container under constant agitation. Therefore, this work represents an alternative to solve two of the biggest problems in recent years; first, the reduction of the overpopulation of sargassum through its use for the remediation of the environment. Second is the removal of drug waste used excessively during the COVID-19 pandemic. Liquid samples of the solution were taken at intervals of 10 min and analyzed by fluorescence to determine the concentration of the drug. The sorption capacity for diclofenac, ibuprofen, and paracetamol was 2.46, 2.08, and 1.41 μg/g, corresponding to 98 %, 84 %, and 54 % of removal, respectively. The removal of the three drugs was notably favored by increasing the temperature to 30 and 40 °C, reaching efficiencies close to 100 %. Moreover, the system maintains its effectiveness at various pH values. In addition, the <i>Sargassum</i> used can be reused for up to three cycles without reducing its removal capacity. The wide diversity of organic compounds favors the biosorption of drugs, removing them through various kinetic mechanisms. On the other hand, the <i>Sargassum</i> used in the drugs removal was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, TGA analysis, and scanning electron microscopy before and after removal. The results showed an evident modification in the structure and morphology of the algae and demonstrated the presence of the biosorbed drugs.

This increased risk was not observed for a sulfonamide COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib), indicating a potential non-enzymatic mechanism for rofexocib. To test this hypothesis, we compared the independent effects of COX-2 inhibitors on human LDL oxidation, an important contributor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The results showed that rofecoxib (100 nM) significantly decreased (>40%, p<0.001) the lag time for LDL conjugated diene formation and increased levels of thiobarbituric-acid-reactive-substances (TBARS) in vitro. The pro-oxidant activity of rofecoxib was dose-dependent and attenuated by 70% (p<0.001) with the antioxidant, Trolox. Rofecoxib and etoricoxib (100 nM) also caused a marked increase (>35%, p<0.001) in non-enzymatic generation of isoprostanes, as measured by mass spectroscopy. Addition of rofecoxib to fresh human plasma reduced the oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) by 34% (p<0.0001). By contrast, other selective (celecoxib, valdecoxib, meloxicam) and non-selective COX inhibitors (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) had no significant effect on LDL oxidation rates or plasma ORAC values, even at suprapharmacologic levels. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that sulfone COX-2 inhibitors interact differently with membrane phospholipids, suggesting a physico-chemical basis for the pro-oxidant activity. These results demonstrate that sulfone COX-2 inhibitors increase the susceptibility of biological lipids to oxidative modification through a non-enzymatic process.

This amino acid derivative is a byproduct of glutathione metabolism, and is reabsorbed efficiently in kidney by Na(+)-coupled transport mechanisms. Previous studies have focused on potential participation of amino acid transport systems in renal reabsorption of this compound. Here we show that it is not the amino acid transport systems but instead the Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 that plays a predominant role in this reabsorptive process. Expression of cloned human and mouse SLC5A8 in mammalian cells induces Na(+)-dependent transport of pyroglutamate that is inhibitable by various SLC5A8 substrates. SLC5A8-mediated transport of pyroglutamate is saturable with a Michaelis constant of 0.36+/-0.04mM. Na(+)-activation of the transport process exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 1.8+/-0.4, indicating involvement of more than one Na(+) in the activation process. Expression of SLC5A8 in Xenopuslaevis oocytes induces Na(+)-dependent inward currents in the presence of pyroglutamate under voltage-clamp conditions. The concentration of pyroglutamate necessary for induction of half-maximal current is 0.19+/-0.01mM. The Na(+)-activation kinetics is sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 2.3+/-0.2. Ibuprofen, a blocker of SLC5A8, suppressed pyroglutamate-induced currents in SLC5A8-expressing oocytes; the concentration of the blocker necessary for causing half-maximal inhibition is 14+/-1microM. The involvement of SLC5A8 can be demonstrated in rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles by showing that the Na(+)-dependent uptake of pyroglutamate in these vesicles is inhibitable by known substrates of SLC5A8.

Analysis of MD simulations indicated that ibuprofen molecules prefer to be located in the hydrophobic acyl chain region of DMPC/cholesterol bilayers. This distribution decreases the lateral motion of lipid molecules. The presence of ibuprofen molecules in the bilayers with 0 and 25mol% cholesterol increases the ordering of hydrocarbon tails of lipids whereas for the bilayers with 50mol% cholesterol, ibuprofen molecules perturb the flexible chains of DMPC lipids which leads to the reduction of the acyl chain order parameter. The potential of the mean force (PMF) method was used to calculate the free energy profile for the transferring of an ibuprofen molecule from the bulk water into the DMPC/cholesterol membranes. The PMF studies indicated that the presence of 50mol% cholesterol in the bilayers increases the free energy barrier and slows down the permeation of the ibuprofen drug across the DMPC bilayer.

This investigation examined whether changes in AEEV cargo induced by an anti-inflammatory agent results in inflammatory modulation that is associated with reward-related processing. Data from a double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures study in healthy volunteers were used to examine the effects of AEEV miRNAs on brain activation during reward-related processing.

Here we show that ibuprofen induces death of Walker 256 tumor cells independently on mitochondrial depolarization as estimated by flow cytometry using DioC(6)(3). Oligomycin increased mitochondrial transmembrane potential in both ibuprofen-treated and non-treated cells, indicating that ATP synthesis was sustained during cell death. Cyclosporin A, but not bongkrekic acid, both mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitors, increased the percentage of cell death in the presence of ibuprofen. FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor like cyclosporin A, also increased ibuprofen-induced cell death. Moreover, we showed that cytochrome c was released during ibuprofen-induced cell death.

In this work, a thermo- and pH-responsive hydrogel (P-CHP407) was prepared from an <i>ad hoc</i> synthesized amphiphilic poly(ether urethane) (CHP407) exposing a significant amount of -COOH groups (8.8 ± 0.9 nmol/g<sub>polymer</sub>). The exposure of acid moieties in P-CHP407 hydrogel led to slightly lower initial gelation temperature (12.1 °C <i>vs.</i> 14.6 °C, respectively) and gelation rate than CHP407 hydrogel, as rheologically assessed. Nanoscale hydrogel characterization by Low Field NMR (LF-NMR) spectroscopy suggested that the presence of carboxylic groups in P-CHP407 caused the formation of bigger micelles with a thicker hydrated shell than CHP407 hydrogels, as further proved by Dynamic Light Scattering analyses. In addition, P-CHP407 hydrogel showed improved capability to change its internal pH compared to CHP407 one when incubated with an alkaline buffer (pH 8) (e.g., pH<sub>change_5min</sub> = 3.76 and 1.32, respectively). Moreover, LF-NMR characterization suggested a stronger alkaline-pH-induced interaction of water molecules with micelles exposing -COOH groups.

Current limitations of stem cells include with their insufficient cell source, poor proliferation capacity, low nucleus pulposus (NP)-specific differentiation potential, and inability to avoid pyroptosis caused by the acidic IDD microenvironment after transplantation. To address these challenges, embryo-derived long-term expandable nucleus pulposus progenitor cells (NPPCs) and esterase-responsive ibuprofen nano-micelles (PEG-PIB) were prepared for synergistic transplantation.

Due to the incorporation of targeted arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences and cell penetrating peptide (CPP) residue octaarginine (R(8)), the micelles could be recognized specifically by cancer cells, as well as transport through the cell membrane efficiently. The observation of laser-scanning confocal microscopy confirmed effective cellular uptaking of porphyrin-loaded peptide micelles. Furthermore, the porphyrin-loaded micelles exhibited low dark toxicity and high phototoxicity against cancer cells, indicating the powerful potential for effective photodynamic therapy.

With a global prevalence of about 0.3%-1% RA is 3-5 times more prevalent in women than in men. There is no known cure for RA; the ultimate goal for treatment of RA is to provide symptomatic relief. The treatment regimen for RA involves frequent drug administration and high doses of NSAIDs such as indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, celecoxib, etorcoxib. These potent drugs often have off target effects which drastically decreases patient compliance. Moreover, conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory have many formulation challenges like low solubility and permeability, poor bioavailability, degradation by gastrointestinal enzymes, food interactions and toxicity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have turned to topical route of drug administration, which has superior patience compliance and they also bypass the first past effect experienced with conventional oral administration. Furthermore, to enhance the permeation of drug through the layers of the skin and reach the site of inflammation, nanosized carriers have been designed such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, niosomes, ethosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles and transferosomes. These drug delivery systems are non-toxic and have high drug encapsulation efficiency and they also provide sustained release of drug.

The main drawback of NSAIDs is that they induce gastric complications such as peptic ulceration and injury to the intestine. Four NSAIDs, indomethacin, diclofenac, aspirin, and ibuprofen were selected to induce gastropathy in mouse models. It was found that the addition of C-terminal half of bovine lactoferrin (C-lobe) reversed the NSAID-induced injuries to the extent of 47-70% whereas the coadministration of C-lobe prevented it significantly. The C-lobe was prepared proteolytically using serine proteases. The binding studies of C-lobe with NSAIDs showed that these compounds bind to C-lobe with affinities ranging from 2.6 to 4.8 x 10(-4) M. The complexes of C-lobe were prepared with the above four NSAIDs. All four complexes were crystallized and their detailed three-dimensional structures were determined using x-ray crystallographic method. The structures showed that all the four NSAID molecules bound to C-lobe at the newly identified ligand binding site in C-lobe that is formed involving two alpha-helices, alpha10 and alpha11. The ligand binding site is separated from the well known iron binding site by the longest and the most stable beta-strand, betaj, in the structure. Similar results were also obtained with the full length lactoferrin molecule.

Furthermore, ibuprofen interactions shift the thermodynamic equilibrium from fibril-like locked states to disordered docked states.

For kinetic transport of biochemical compounds or drug molecules, the permeability through the phospholipid membranes is a key kinetic property, but long timescales are hindering the accurate computation. Technological advances in high-performance computing therefore need to be accompanied by theoretical and methodological developments. In this contribution, the replica exchange transition interface sampling (RETIS) methodology is shown to give perspective toward observing longer permeation pathways. It is first reviewed how RETIS, a path-sampling methodology that gives in principle exact kinetics, can be used to compute membrane permeability. Next, recent and current developments in three RETIS aspects are discussed: several new Monte Carlo moves in the path-sampling algorithm, memory reduction by reducing pathlengths, and exploitation of parallel computing with CPU-imbalanced replicas. Finally, the memory reduction presenting a new replica exchange implementation, coined REPPTIS, is showcased with a permeant needing to pass a membrane with two permeation channels, either representing an entropic or energetic barrier. The REPPTIS results showed clearly that inclusion of some memory and enhancing ergodic sampling via replica exchange moves are both necessary to obtain correct permeability estimates. In an additional example, ibuprofen permeation through a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine membrane was modeled. REPPTIS succeeded in estimating the permeability of this amphiphilic drug molecule with metastable states along the permeation pathway. In conclusion, the presented methodological advances allow for deeper insight into membrane biophysics even if the pathways are slow, as RETIS and REPPTIS push the permeability calculations to longer timescales.",2023,,"Vervust W, Zhang DT, van Erp TS, Ghysels A.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2023.02.021,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The performance of 3xTg-AD mice was significantly improved with ibuprofen treatment compared to untreated 3xTg-AD mice. Ibuprofen-treated transgenic mice showed a significant decrease in intraneuronal oligomeric Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus.

Our findings show that prophylactic treatment of young 3xTg-AD mice with ibuprofen reduces intraneuronal oligomeric Abeta, reduces cognitive deficits, and prevents hyperphosphorylated tau immunoreactivity.

Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that independently of its anti-inflammatory effects has anti-amyloidogenic activity as a gamma-secretase modulator (GSM) and both activities have the potential to decrease Aß pathology. To further understand the effects of NSAIDs in 3xTg-AD mice, we treated 3xTg-AD mice with R-flurbiprofen, an enantiomer of the NSAID flurbiprofen that maintains the GSM activity but has greatly reduced anti-inflammatory activity, and analyzed its effect on cognition, Aß, tau, and the neurochemical profile of the hippocampus. Treatment with R-flurbiprofen from 5 to 7 months of age resulted in improved cognition on the radial arm water maze (RAWM) test and decreased the level of hyperphosphorylated tau immunostained with AT8 and PHF-1 antibodies. No significant changes in the level of Aß (using 6E10 and NU-1 antibodies) were detected. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) we found that R-flurbiprofen treatment decreased the elevated level of glutamine in 3xTg-AD mice down to the level detected in non-transgenic mice. Glutamine levels correlated with PHF-1 immunostained hyperphosphorylated tau.

We investigated whether siblings and parents of children with IBS or FAP have increased gut permeability.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed permeability tests (using sucrose, lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose) on 29 siblings and 43 parents of children with IBS or FAP, and 43 children (controls) and 42 parents of controls, from primary and secondary care. Permeability studies were repeated in 7 siblings and 37 parents of children with IBS or FAP and 23 controls and 36 parents of controls following ingestion of 400 mg of ibuprofen. Percent recovery of sucrose was calculated based on analyses of urine collected overnight; the lactulose/mannitol ratio and percent recovery of sucralose were based on analyses of urine samples collected over a 24-hour period.<h4>Results</h4>When we controlled for age, sex, and family membership, siblings of children with IBS or FAP had increased small bowel permeability (urinary lactulose/mannitol ratio) vs controls (P = .004). There was no difference in gastroduodenal (percent sucrose recovery) or colonic (percent sucralose recovery) permeability between groups.

It has been detected in effluents of wastewater plant treatments, sewage sludge, hospital wastewaters, surface waters, and drinking water due to its continuous release to the environment, mainly from the excretion in the urine of animals and humans. IBP is a carcinogenic and non-steroidal endocrine disrupting drug with harmful effects over fungal, bacterial, algae, microorganisms, crustacean, and fish species, and can be potentially hazard for human health. Since conventional treatments remove inefficiently this drug, many advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed aiming their abatement from waters to avoid their harmful health problems. This paper presents an exhaustive and critical review on the application of AOPs to treat synthetic waters, natural waters, and real wastewaters polluted with IBP alone or mixed with other common drugs covering up to 2020.

The chromatographic behavior of this system gave a good fit with that predicted by computer simulations based on a reversible, saturable model for the binding of an injected drug with immobilized HSA. The free fractions measured by this method were found to be comparable to those determined by ultrafiltration, and equilibrium constants estimated by this approach gave good agreement with literature values. Advantages of this method include its speed and the relatively low cost of microcolumns that contain HSA. The ability of HSA to bind many types of drugs also creates the possibility of using the same affinity microcolumn to study and measure the free fractions for a variety of pharmaceutical agents.

However, there is a lack of data in the scientific literature regarding these events.<h4>Objectives</h4>This report describes a case of an anaphylactoid reaction, considered probably ciprofloxacin related, that manifested as angioedema and later as pulmonary edema. This report also summarizes the available scientific evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and outcome of ciprofloxacin-associated anaphylactoid reactions.<h4>Methods</h4>Previously reported cases were identified using a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (years: 1960-June 2009; English-language articles; search terms: ciprofloxacin, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema, and pulmonary edema). The references cited in these articles were examined to identify additional reports. CASE SUMMARY/RESULTS: A 25-year-old healthy white woman with a weight of 65 kg and normal renal function presented with pyelonephritis. She was administered ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID PO and ibuprofen 400 mg q6h PO as needed for pain control. The following day, angioedema and pulmonary edema developed and were thought to be probably associated with ciprofloxacin use (Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score, 6). Ciprofloxacin treatment was discontinued and supportive care with ceftriaxone 1 g/d IV was provided, and the patient recovered after 1 week of hospitalization. The adverse drug reactions associated with the intake of fluoroquinolones most commonly affect the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, and skin. The literature search identified 64 cases of anaphylactoid reaction considered probably ciprofloxacin related. Forty-two of these cases were described in large studies, with no detailed data reported. Detailed information on the dose of ciprofloxacin, the time period between ciprofloxacin administration and anaphylactoid reaction, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of these reactions was available in 22 cases described in case reports. Twelve of these cases were described in HIV- patients; 10 cases were described in HIV+ patients. All of the patients recovered, with the exception of 2 patients with HIV infection, who died (unknown cause of death in 1 case and toxoplasma encephalitis in the other case). Fourteen patients (including all of the patients with HIV infection) required hospitalization in the intensive care unit. According to the manufacturer of ciprofloxacin, pulmonary edema has been described as an adverse event associated with ciprofloxacin in <1% of treated patients. However, a search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases did not identify any documented reports of ciprofloxacin-associated pulmonary edema.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The patient described in this case report experienced an anaphylactoid reaction likely associated with ciprofloxacin use.

A combined experimental and computational approach was employed to study the fabrication of MIL-88B(Fe) film on functionalized Au surfaces. We used several surface characterization techniques, including infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to confirm the chemical composition and morphological changes of the surface after each modification step. The resulting MIL-88B(Fe) thin film was found capable of loading 8.7 wt% of ibuprofen using quartz crystal microbalance analysis. Moreover, we applied cluster simulations to study the binding mechanisms of MIL-88B(Fe) and its interactions with ibuprofen based on the density functional theory (DFT). The unsaturated Fe site was confirmed kinetically more favorable to bind to the COOH-end group on the SAM.

We applied ibuprofen (IBU) as model molecule which has low solubility. The changes in the BSA's secondary structure during the steps of the synthesis were inspected by FT-IR measurements. The size and the zeta potential were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The changes in the structure and in the size were investigated by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) too, for each composite. The release of the ibuprofen was studied by vertical diffusion cell (Franz cell) at pH 7.4 at 25 and 37.5°C. The structure of the core-shell nanoparticles have significantly changed as the pH has risen from 3.0 to 7.4. Kinetic models were used to describe the release mechanism. The experimental results demonstrated that the BSA has an ordered structure at pH=3 which will become random coil by adding ibuprofen. The first shell restores the ordered structure of the protein.

As a consequence of such variability in pH there is a corresponding variability in the degree of ionisation which in turn, could influence permeation through the mainly hydrophobic-rich membrane structure. This study reports the effect of pH on the permeation of five model compounds (benzoic acid, benzotriazole, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and lidocaine). For the five compounds analysed, each at three distinct percentages of ionisation, it was found that the greater extent of permeation was always for the more 'neutral', i.e. more greatly unionised, species rather than the anionic or cationic species. These findings fit with the theory that the hydrophobic membrane encourages permeation of 'lipid-like' structures, i.e. the more unionised form of compounds. However, results obtained with an Inverse Gas Chromatography Surface Energy Analyser (iGC SEA) indicate the membrane surface to be an electron dense environment. In the knowledge that unionised forms of compounds permeate (rather than the charged species) this negatively charged surface was not anticipated, i.e. the basic membrane surface did not appear to affect permeation.",2016,,"Waters LJ, Bhuiyan AKMMH.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.01.055,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Deep eutectic lidocaine ibuprofen (Lid·Ibu) was selected as the oil phase, and the imidazolium ionic liquid, 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([HOEmim]Cl), was incorporated into the aqueous phase as a transdermal enhancer. The ingredients for the microemulsion in this study were selected, and their ratios were optimized. The optimal microemulsion carrier was composed of 45 wt% of water phase, 45 wt% surfactant phase (containing Tween-80, Span-20, and ethanol (co-surfactant) with the weight ratio of 1:1:1), and 10 wt% Lid·Ibu as the oil phase with artemisinin loading of 1.0 wt% (all the ratios were based on the total weight of microemulsion). Physical properties of this microemulsion, including particle size (41.95 ± 0.85 nm), viscosity (26.65 ± 0.13 mPa·s) and density (1.02 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), were measured. In-vitro transdermal assay showed a remarkable enhancement of artemisinin transport through the skin, with the permeation flux being 3-fold of the value for isopropyl myristate system in 6 h. The impact of IL-based microemulsion (ILME) on stratum corneum (SC) was investigated by DSC, ATR-FTIR and AFM, which unveiled that the ILME possesses the ability of reducing the SC barrier by disrupting the regular arrangement of keratin, resulting in enhancement of transdermal delivery of artemisinin. This current work suggested that the microemulsion proposed here had an excellent capability to promote the transdermal delivery of artemisinin, which might also be a promising vehicle for the skin delivery of other hydrophobic natural drugs.",2020,,"Zhang Y, Cao Y, Meng X, Li C, Wang H, Zhang S.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.110886,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In vivo experiments in humans are not always possible for ethical, practical, or economic reasons, especially in the first part of the drug development. It is necessary to develop alternative methods using accessible and reproducible surrogates for in vivo human skin. The in vitro methodologies using biological membranes (human and animal skin) are recognized and well accepted as an alternative but present high inter- and intra-individual variability. Therefore, the formation of synthetic membranes has been studied to obtain skin- mimicking models for permeation studies. The aim of this work is to create lanolin-based artificial membranes that can mimic the absorption through the skin of compounds applied topically. A series of synthetic membranes using two different types of lanolin (water-extracted (WE) and solvent-extracted (SE)) were prepared. Next, the in vitro release test of three drugs (diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen and lidocaine) was performed on artificial membranes and on porcine skin placed on Franz cells. The percentage of release, flux, permeability coefficient, lag time, area under the curve, maximal concentration and time were determined for each compound in the different types of membrane. The results showed that lanolin membranes presented a strong diminution of permeability compared to most artificial membranes, leading to a very similar permeability to that of skin. The SE and WE membranes showed a diminution of transepidermal water loss and permeability of compounds compared with membranes alone. The results from WE membranes were similar to those found for the skin. The lanolin membranes were not capable of perfectly mimicking permeation through the skin, but they did have the same rank order of drug penetration as the skin. It may be deduced from these tests that these systems provide more reliable results for compounds with low to medium lipophilicity. The results demonstrated that new lanolin-based artificial membranes have the potential to be exploited as screening models for determining the permeability of a compound destined to be topically delivered.",2020,,"Alonso C, Collini I, Carrer V, Barba C, Martí M, Coderch L.",http://hdl.handle.net/10261/212237,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Dexibuprofen (DEX) is routinely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, acute postoperative pain, primary dysmenorrheal, and in lower back pain. However, it is poorly water soluble with compromised bioavailability, and hence has limited therapeutic activity. In order to overcome these issues, we studied the formulation and characterization of nanoemulsion based system i.e nanoemulgel of DEX. This study aimed to prepare topical nanoemulgel containing 2 % DEX and solubility-enhanced DEX via ternary inclusion complexation (DEX-SE-T) and to compare it with commercially available 5 % Ibuprofen gel as there is no topical formulation of DEX is available in the market currently. A pseudoternary phase diagram was constructed using the spontaneous water titration method. Blank and drug-loaded nanoemulgel were prepared using a high-speed homogenization method. All the formulations were evaluated in terms of particle size, pH, conductivity, viscosity, zeta potential, and ex vivo drug permeation. DEX loaded nanoemulgel yield enhanced in vitro skin permeation than the commercially available 5 % ibuprofen gel. The optimized nanoemulgel formulation (DEX-SE-T) was tested in in vivo anti-inflammatory models including cotton pellets-induced abdominal granuloma (chronic inflammation) and carrageenan-induced paw edema (acute inflammation). DEX-SE-T loaded nanoemulgel has improved in vivo anti-inflammatory activity as compared to ibuprofen gel.

A preliminary chemical analysis of wastewater identified several compounds associated with PPCPs, including caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine. The purpose of this study was to examine the cytotoxic and oxidative effects of these products and other wastewater-related products (i.e., coprostanol, cotinine, estradiol-17beta, nonylphenol, and cholesterol) in primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes. The redox activity of various PPCPs in trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver microsomes was investigated in vitro by tracking the rate of oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and the formation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) after a 60-min incubation period. In addition, primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes were exposed to various drugs identified in the municipal effluent for 48 h at 15 degrees C. Our results show that most PPCPs (83%) accelerated the rate of NADPH oxidation in the presence of microsomes and 72% of them increased LPO in microsomal membranes. LPO levels were significantly correlated (R = 0.5; P<0.05) with the number of functional groups on the molecule's backbone (i.e., number of O, S, N, P/number of C and H) and negatively so (R = -0.44; P<0.05) with the octanol/water partition coefficient, suggesting that nucleophilicity and hydrophobicity are related to oxidative activity for these compounds. Exposure of trout hepatocytes to these products leads in many cases to decreased cell viability, increased CYP3A-related monooxygenase activity (benzylether resorufin dealkylase), and LPO. No induction of CYP1A1-related activity (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase) was observed. Moreover, municipal effluent extracts (ethanol) were able to increase all the above responses in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the basic redox properties of PPCPs could influence oxidative metabolism in liver cells and lead to oxidative damage. These products have the potential to produce a toxic response in aquatic organisms and the above biomarkers were shown to respond readily to PPCPs in aquatic organisms.",2006,,"Gagné F, Blaise C, André C.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2005.04.004,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although a handful of previous studies have shown the impacts of pharmaceutically active compounds on the environment, the toxicological effects of their degradation products remain largely unknown. In the current study, the photo-degradation products of environmental ibuprofen were assessed for both ecotoxicological and human health effects using a series of in vitro assays. Here, six of the major degradation products are synthesized with high purity (>98%) and characterized with <sup>1</sup>HNMR, <sup>13</sup>CNMR, FT-IR and HRMS. To evaluate human health effects, three gut microbiota species, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, and two human cell lines, HEK293T and HepG2, are exposed to various concentrations of ibuprofen and its degradation products. On L. acidophilus, the ibuprofen degradation product (±)-(2R,3R)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol shows a greater toxic effect while ibuprofen enhances its growth at lower concentrations. At higher concentrations, ibuprofen shows at least a 2-fold higher toxicity compared to that of its degradation products. However, E. faecalis shows little or no effect upon exposure to these compounds. An induction of the SOS response in E. coli is observed but limited to only ibuprofen and 4-acetylbenzoic acid. In human cell line studies, survival of both HEK293T and HepG2 cell lines is profoundly impaired by the photo-degradation products of (±)- (2R,3R)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol, (±)-(2R,3S)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol, and (±)-1-(4-(1-hydroxy-2methylpropyl)phenyl)ethan-1-one. In this work, the bioluminescence bacterium, Aliivibrio fischeri, is used as a model to assess environmental impact. Both ibuprofen and its degradation products inhibit the growth of this gram-negative bacteria with the primary compound showing the most significant impact.

Whilst the substrate capacity of this transporter is broad, studies have largely been limited to small peptides and peptide-like drugs. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a diverse range of drugs can be targeted towards transport by PepT1 using a hydrolysis resistant carrier. Eleven prodrugs were synthesized by conjugating modified dipeptides containing a thioamide bond to the approved drugs ibuprofen, gabapentin, propofol, aspirin, acyclovir, nabumetone, atenolol, zanamivir, baclofen and mycophenolate. Except for the aspirin and acyclovir prodrugs, which were unstable in the assay conditions and were not further studied, the prodrugs were tested for affinity and transport by PepT1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes: binding affinities ranged from approximately 0.1 to 2 mM. Compounds which showed robust transport in an oocyte trans-stimulation assay were then tested for transcellular transport in Caco-2 cell monolayers: all five tested prodrugs showed significant PepT1-mediated transcellular uptake. Finally, the ibuprofen and propofol prodrugs were tested for absorption in rats: following oral dosing the intact prodrugs and free ibuprofen were measured in the plasma.

In this study, the activity of ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was evaluated on the control of pre-established adhered cells (2 h) and 24 h old biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial adhesion was performed by S. aureus CECT 976, while biofilm formation was also performed by the antibiotic-resistant strains: SA1199B, RN4220 and XU212. The treatment with ibuprofen promoted metabolic reductions up to 80% and total loss of culturability of adhered cells and 24 h old biofilms. Ibuprofen demonstrated moderate efficacy to remove biofilms of S. aureus CECT 976 (removal ≤ 40%), but did not display removal action against the antibiotic-resistant strains.

Uterine rings were used for isometric tension recording. Effect of SLIGRL (0.1 mM) on spontaneous contractions before and after exposure to ibuprofen (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 1.0 microM), SQ-29548 (thromboxane A(2) receptor inhibitor, 1.0 microM), ketotifen (histamine 1 receptor inhibitor, 10 microM), WEB-2170BS (platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor inhibitor, 10 microM), atropine (muscarinic receptor inhibitor, 0.1 microM), or ketanserin (serotonin receptor inhibitor, 10 microM) were compared. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's or Newman-Keuls post hoc tests were used for statistical analysis when appropriate.<h4>Significance</h4>P<0.05.<h4>Results</h4>The agents did not significantly affect time-associated decay in spontaneous contractile activity in any group of the tissues. Activation of spontaneous contractions induced by SLIGRL in non-pregnant rat myometrium did not involve coactivation of membrane chemoceptors, while in mid-pregnant rat myometrium coactivation of prostanoid, histamine, and serotonin receptors and in late pregnant rat myometrium coactivation of thromboxane receptors was noted. Expression of PAR-2 mRNA was similar in non-pregnant, mid-pregnant, and late pregnant rat myometrium.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Expression of PAR-2 in rat myometrium is not dependent on gestational age.

Furthermore drug permeation could be increased by choice of a permeation enhancing formulation. In this study, permeation of ALA and ABE was investigated from various formulations. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) experiments were performed in order to reveal an interaction between the tested formulations and stratum corneum lipid structure. Drug incorporation into Dolgit Mikrogel showed the highest increase in permeability with both ALA and ABE. Especially, ABE together with Dolgit Mikrogel was the most promising combination. Further permeation studies with poloxamer based ABE formulations, partially enriched with ibuprofen acid and medium chained triglycerides showed that both compounds promote permeation. The permeation coefficients of either drug from Excipial Creme and Basiscreme DAC were found to be very similar. These results were in accordance with those of DSC and WAXD experiments. Interaction between formulation and stratum corneum lipid structure resulting in an increased drug permeation only occurred after pretreatment with formulations enriched with ibuprofen acid. After pretreatment with Excipial Creme, Basiscreme DAC or Excipial Fettcreme stratum corneum structure and subsequently permeability remained unchanged. Nevertheless permeation of ALA from Excipial Fettcreme is slower than from the tested hydrophilic formulations and therefore believed to be influenced by the affinity of ALA to the vehicle and stratum corneum.",2005,,"Winkler A, Müller-Goymann CC.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2005.01.014,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The efficacy of three low molecular weight excipients (propylene glycol, PG, Cremophor EL and Cremophor RH) and of two copolymers of methacrylic acid (Eudragit((R)) E, EuE, and Eudragit((R)) RL, EuRL) as IB crystallization inhibitors was tested. The performances of the patches were evaluated in terms of drug release and human stratum corneum and epidermis (SCE) permeation profile. The interactions between IB and the other excipients were investigated by ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy. The stability of the patches, prepared without adding crystallization inhibitors, was unsatisfactory because crystals grew in less than 1 month. Among the low molecular weight molecules, only PG inhibited the IB crystallization up to 50 days without affecting the IB skin permeation profile. The addition of EuE or EuRL in the matrices prevented drug crystallization for more than 12 months. EuE significantly reduced the IB in vitro release rate and the IB permeated amount through the SCE compared to other formulations.

The increase in MA content in the copolymer significantly increased the percentage of elongation and decreased the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the membranes. The degree of swelling of the EMA membranes increased with the ethanol composition and MA content. The contact angle of a sessile drop (10 microL of ethanol/water solution) decreased with an increase in the ethanol fraction suggesting that the membrane wettibility increased with the ethanol content. The flux of diltiazem hydrochloride increased from 0.012 to 0.018 mg cm(-2)h(-1) with an increase in the MA content from 16.5 to 29.0%.

Secondary photoprotection is the application of medicinal agents to the body after sun exposure to reduce this damage. The objective of this study was to determine the affects of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) complexation on the secondary photoprotective properties of topically applied ibuprofen. Complexation of ibuprofen by HPCD was demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry, while solubilities were determined using HPLC. A linear (r2>0.999) relationship was found between ibuprofen solubility and HPCD concentration. For subsequent experiments, the concentration of ibuprofen was held constant at the solubility in 10% HPCD (10.6 mg/ml), while the HPCD concentration varied from 0 to 20% (w/w). In vitro transdermal permeation experiments demonstrated a parabolic relationship between transdermal kinetic parameters and HPCD concentration, with maximum values for both flux and skin accumulation occurring with the 10% HPCD formulation.

Two coagel formulations and the same coagels added of polyethylene glycol (PEG-400) were assayed in comparison with a commercial product (Arfen®) by using hairless rat skin as model. The ASC₁₆ and ASC₁₂ derivatives gave rise to stable supramolecular assemblies in water and in water/PEG mixtures (coagels), allowing the solubilization of IBU (0.85%) and producing a IBU controlled release systems, as evidenced by the dynamic dialyse test: the n values were near 1.0, indicative of a linear kinetic, for all coagel formulations, except for the ASC₁₂PEG/C formulation (n=1.51). Our results evidenced the enhancement activity of coagels and the synergic effect of the combination with PEG: all coagels showed a higher amount of IBU permeated through the skin compared to commercial Arfen® with an enhancement factor of 52.94 and 21.53 for ASC₁₂PEG/C and ASC₁₆/C respectively. Otherwise, coagels formulations appeared to produce a low IBU depot in the skin and in the same order of magnitude in epidermis and derma, in spite of significant increase of IBU cutaneous permeation. The positive synergic effect of the coagel-PEG mixtures was demonstrated by the high amount of IBU accumulated in the upper skin layers.

A comparison to other lipid nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and polymeric nanocarriers has been made. It was found that LNC could increase the flux rate of ibuprofen 21.9±0.5 compared to 5.8±0.4 μg/cm(2)h in case of drug solution. Similar flux rates were obtained for SLN and NLC with average values of 22.9±0.5 and 22.5±2.0 μg/cm(2)h, respectively.

Current CF treatment strategies are focused on targeted drug delivery to the lungs. Novel inhalable drug therapies require an in vitro CF model that appropriately mimics the in vivo CF lung environment to better understand drug delivery and transport across the CF epithelium, and predict drug therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the appropriate air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method of the CuFi-1 (CF cell line) compared to the NuLi-1 (healthy cell line) cells to be used as in vitro models of CF airway epithelia. Furthermore, drug transport on both CuFi-1 and NuLi-1 was investigated to determine whether these cell lines could be used to study transport of drugs used in CF treatment using Ibuprofen (the only anti-inflammatory drug currently approved for CF) as a model drug. Differentiating characteristics specific to airway epithelia such as mucus production, inflammatory response and tight junction formation at two seeding densities (Low and High) were assessed throughout an 8-week ALI culture period. This study demonstrated that both the NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines fully differentiate in ALI culture with significant mucus secretion, IL-6 and IL-8 production, and functional tight junctions at week 8. Additionally, the High seeding density was found to alter the phenotype of the NuLi-1 cell line. For the first time, this study identifies that ibuprofen is transported via the paracellular pathway in ALI models of NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines.

Also, we have tested whether the addition of lauric acid to propylene glycol improves skin permeation for the opioids and NSAIDs. We found that the addition of lauric acid to propylene glycol dramatically improves the penetration of the drugs, measured by the drug's ED(50). We observed a significant dose response shift to the left for all tested drugs. So, morphine's ED(50) was decreased by 19-fold. The duration of the analgesic activity of morphine dissolved in a combination of propylene glycol and lauric acid was much longer compared with the same dose of the drug dissolved in propylene glycol only. Methadone and hydrocodone also produced analgesic activity in this experimental paradigm. We then assessed potential interactions between opioids, ibuprofen and diclofenac using a fixed, low dose of each. The inclusion of either S-ibuprofen or diclofenac to a fixed, low dose of morphine raised the analgesic response from around 20% to 50% and 80%, respectively.

First degree burn of the paw elicits a secondary hyperalgesia that is dependent on Ca2+ permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), but not N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The present study takes advantage of that specificity by examining the effects of spinal pretreatments of agents on this secondary hyperalgesia. Rats with indwelling intrathecal catheters were pretreated with agents prior to paw injury. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured before, and for three h after the injury. Spinal pretreatment with cyclooxygenase (10 and 30 microg (S)-(+)-ibuprofen; and 3 and 30 microg ketorolac) and nitric oxide synthase (33 and 100 microg N(G) Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) and 10 microg thiocitrulline) inhibitors resulted in no specific anti-allodynia.

The average thickness of the unstirred water layer on each side of the membrane was estimated to be nearly 2000 microm, somewhat larger than that found in Caco-2 permeability assays (unstirred). Since the UWL thickness in the human intestine is believed to be about forty times smaller, it is critical to correct the in vitro permeability data for the effect of the UWL. Without such correction, the in vitro permeability coefficient of lipophilic molecules would be indicative only of the property of water. In single-pH PAMPA (e.g. pH 7.4), the uncertainty of the UWL contribution can be minimized if a specially-selected pH (possibly different from 7.4) were used in the assay. From the analysis of the shapes of the log P(e)-pH plots, a method to improve the selection of the assay pH, called pK(a)(flux)-optimized design (pOD-PAMPA), was described and tested. From an optimally-selected assay pH, it is possible to estimate P(o), as well as the entire membrane permeability-pH profile.",2003,,"Ruell JA, Tsinman KL, Avdeef A.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2003.08.006,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Reduction of the charge on the molecule would be expected to enhance skin penetration. The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug benzydamine hydrochloride with suitable counter-ions including ibuprofen sodium. The influence of pH of the donor solution and hence degree of ionization on partitioning between n-octanol:buffer and the flux of benzydamine hydrochloride across polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) membrane and human epidermis was determined. The maximum flux was determined at pH 7.6 when the fraction unionized was 2.51%, rather than at pH 9 when the fraction unionized was 38.7%. This suggests that at higher pH, although the permeability coefficient is increased, the decrease in solubility and therefore concentration of dissolved benzydamine in the medium results in a decrease in flux across the PDMS membrane. Ion-pair formation or interaction with each of the counter-ions was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Significant increases in logP and flux across PDMS membrane were determined for the ion-pairs (0.087, 12.54, 11.31, 0.121 microg cm(-2)h(-1) for benzydamine hydrochloride and ion-pairs with ibuprofen sodium, sodium benzoate and sodium octane sulfonate respectively).

The rigorous analysis of the concentration dependence of these processes is often limited by the lack of knowledge of the actual concentration at the site of action because the measurement of the local concentration is seldom feasible. However, the local concentrations can be estimated if the rates into and out of a particular location are known. Thus, an insight into the distribution of the permeation resistance in the in vitro cell monolayer permeation experiments would enable the estimation of local concentrations during the permeation experiments and, consequently, a more thorough analysis of the concentration dependent processes involved in the transepithelial transfer of compounds. In this study, a compartmental model was constructed applicable for dissecting the roles of apical and basal side aqueous boundary layers and the cell membranes in the total permeation barrier for weakly acidic and basic compounds. The model was applied for the analysis of the Caco-2 permeation data of three high permeability compounds, propranolol, metoprolol and ibuprofen.

The anti-inflammatory effect of these NSAID preparations was evaluated in rat models of acute inflammation (carrageenan or yeast treatment) and chronic inflammation (collagen or adjuvant treatment). Skin permeability of the preparations was evaluated in vitro using mouse skin. In rats with acute inflammation, both ketoprofen preparations significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced edema and yeast-induced hyperalgesia. Flurbiprofen and diclofenac preparations also showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect, but the ketoprofen products were the most potent among the four patch preparations and five gel preparations. With repeated application, the ketoprofen patch significantly decreased edema from day 3 in collagen-treated rats, while other preparations (ketoprofen gel, diclofenac patch, and diclofenac gel) decreased edema from day 7. In rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, only the ketoprofen patch significantly decreased edema after 2 weeks of application. In the skin permeation study, the ketoprofen preparations showed higher skin permeability compared with the other NSAID preparations. These results suggested that ketoprofen preparations had the most potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity related to good skin permeability. Efficacy of the ketoprofen patch was comparable to or better than that of ketoprofen gel at a lower dose and frequency of administration.

Xanthan gum demonstrated the performances of a thickening agent in physically stable HTMs at 5±3°C, 20±3°C, and 40±1°C during 6months. The results of physicochemical characterization (pH, conductivity, rheological behaviour, spreadability) indicated that HTMs containing 0.25-1.00% of the polymer had colloidal structure with oil nanodroplets of 14.34±0.98nm (PdI 0.220±0.075) dispersed in aqueous phase thickened with the polymer gel network which strength depended on the polymer concentration. HTMs with ibuprofen (5%) were evaluated as percutaneous drug delivery carriers. In vitro ibuprofen release from HTMs followed zero order kinetic (r>0.995) for 12h, while the referent hydrogel was described by Higuchi model. The HTM with optimized drug release rate and spreadability (HTM1) and the polymer-free microemulsion (M) were assessed and compared with the referent hydrogel in in vivo studies in rats.

For this purpose, a simple but reliable syringe-based hot melt/moulding method was employed. Chloramphenicol (antibiotic) and ibuprofen (anti-inflammatory) were chosen as model active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to be loaded into the gfSDFs. To optimize the formulations, the gfSDFs of different compositions were studied in terms of APIs release from the matrix, solid-state characteristics, gellification properties and gfSDFs resistance to mechanical stress. Release studies showed that both APIs were released at a constant rate at different pH (pH5 and 7.4, respectively) and the changes in the formulation composition affected the release behaviour. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results evidenced the complete solubilization of both API in the solid matrix. Texture analysis showed that the gfSDFs were capable of swelling once in a contact with aqueous environment and that the textural properties changed extemporaneously from the solid to gel form.

Triethyl citrate (TEC) was found to be a better liquid plasticizer than PEG 400 both in reducing the glass transition temperature of the coating polymer (cellulose acetate) and in increasing the electrical conductivity of the ODDS cores, both of which led to an enhanced coating powder adhesion and film formation. Results of SEM indicated that the uniformity of the coating film varied significantly with the difference of curing time and temperature.

This work focuses on the evaluation of both rheological and texture properties of EuRL differently plasticized with tributyl citrate (TBC) or triacetin (TRI) in order to design a pressure sensitive adhesive suitable for transdermal patch preparation. The patch adhesive properties (i.e. tack, peel adhesion and shear adhesion) as well as its in vitro biopharmaceutical performances were determined after loading ibuprofen, ketoprofen or flurbiprofen. The addition of 40-60% w/w TBC or 40-50% w/w TRI to EuRL permitted to obtain matrices with the desired adhesive properties. Moreover, the increase of plasticizer content and loading of the drug reduced the relaxation time (τ<sub>R</sub>). Consequently, the shear adhesion values decreased and the in vitro drug release constants (k) increased. Indeed, the k values from patches containing TBC were lower than the corresponding with TRI because of the lower fluidity of such matrices.

The release behavior of ibuprofen from the pectin hydrogels was found to involve 4 modes of release: Fickian diffusion; Anomalous transport; Case-II transport; and Super case II transport. The diffusion coefficient was shown to be significantly improved by two factors: using a FeCl<sub>2</sub> as the crosslinking agent and applied electric potential. For both crosslinking agents, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing crosslinking ratio.

Unfortunately, oral IBU can cause adverse gastrointestinal drug reactions, such as bleeding and ulcerations, and increases the risk for stomach or intestinal perforations. In this study, IBU nanoparticles (IBU-NPs) were prepared through emulsion solvent evaporation and freeze-drying to improve their solubility. IBU nanoemulsion and nanosuspension were optimized through a single-factor experiment. IBU-NPs with a mean particle size of 216.9±10.7nm were produced under optimum conditions. These IBU-NPs were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and residual solvent determination to determine their solvent residue, equilibrium solubility, dissolution rate, in vitro transdermal rate, transdermal bioavailability, and antifebrile experiment for febrile rats. The morphological characteristic of IBU-NPs showed porous clusters. Analysis results indicated that the prepared IBU-NPs have low crystallinity. Residual amounts of ethanol and chloroform were 170 and 9.6ppm, respectively, which were less than the ICH limit for class II. Measurement analysis showed that the IBU-NPs were converted underwent amorphous states after preparation, but the chemical structure of the IBU-NPs was unchanged.

Furthermore, the IBU-NP transdermal gel exhibited a high and stable cooling rate and a long cooling duration in febrile rats. In comparison with the raw oral IBU and raw IBU transdermal gel, the IBU-NP transdermal gel manifested better efficacy at low and mid doses.

These variations impacted only in 1 % IB formulations where both the equivalences of rheological data and J-values failed. At the highest concentration, the presence of IB crystals broke down the differences in rheological patterns and lead the IB thermodynamic activity at the maximum figuring out an overlapping of the J-values.

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.",2011,,"Xing B, Li H, Wang H, Mukhopadhyay D, Fisher D, Gilpin CJ, Li S.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.06.018,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this work, a comprehensive simulation study on the diffusion of the native <i>α</i>-, <i>β</i>- and <i>γ</i>-CDs in aqueous solutions is carried out using Molecular Dynamics simulations. The effect of the system size on the computed self-diffusivity is investigated and it is found that the required correction can be as much as 75% of the final value. The effect of the water force field is examined and it is shown that the q4md-CD/TIP4P/2005 force field combination predicts the experimentally measured self-diffusion coefficients of CDs very accurately. The self-diffusion coefficients of the three native CDs were also computed in aqueous-NaCl solutions using the Joung and Cheatham (JC) and the Madrid-2019 force fields. It is found that Na + ions have higher affinity towards the CDs when the JC force field is used and for this reason the predicted diffusivity of CDs is lower compared to simulations using the Madrid-2019 force field. As a model system for drug delivery and waste-water treatment applications, the diffusion of the <i>β</i>-CD:Ibuprofen inclusion complex in water is studied. In agreement with experiments for similar components, it is shown that the inclusion complex and the free <i>β</i>-CD have almost equal self-diffusion coefficients.

It is therefore important to consider whether ingredients other than the active may: 1) alter absorption of the active chemical, or 2) be absorbed themselves, resulting in systemic effects. Frogs have highly permeable skin and are routinely exposed to commercial chemical products in the environment or therapeutically. Ethanol and propylene glycol (PG), which have known penetration-enhancing effects, are commonly included in such products. The current study has therefore investigated the <i>in vitro</i> absorption kinetics through <i>Rh. marina</i> skin of three model chemicals - caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen - formulated individually as solutions containing: 1%, 10% or 30% v/v ethanol, or 20% v/v PG. Differential scanning calorimetry and histology were used to characterise fresh frog skin, investigate the mechanism of these enhancers in frog skin, and to determine whether these enhancers significantly affected skin structure. Results showed that the extent of absorption enhancement was influenced by chemical, enhancer and skin region, and that enhancement was generally not consistent for individual enhancers or skin regions. The exception was 1% v/v ethanol, which did not significantly alter flux across the skin for any of the chemicals evaluated. Caffeine absorption was not enhanced by any of the investigated penetration enhancers, and was in fact significantly reduced by 30% v/v ethanol and PG. Ethanol caused concentration-dependant changes in skin morphology and should be avoided in concentrations ≥10% v/v. PG, however, caused minimal changes to the skin and consistently improved absorption of benzoic acid and ibuprofen through all skin regions. Owing to the significant changes in skin structure following ≥10% v/v ethanol exposure, it is recommended to avoid its use in frogs.

Morris Water Maze test was used to evaluate the learning and memory ability, Nissl's staining and immunofluorescence double staining for neuron damage and MG M1/M2 polarization, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for neuroinflammation biomarkers in hippocampus, Western blot for key protein expression of TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway. In vitro experiments, 10 μM/l Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> induced BV-2 cell model was used to re-verify the effect of YHD regulating MG polarization to reduce neuroinflammation. Also, TREM2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to clarify the key target of YHD.<h4>Results</h4>YHD could improve the learning and memory ability of SAMP8 mice evaluated by the Morris Water Maze test. Like Ibuprofen, YHD could regulate the M1/M2 polarization of MG and the levels of neuroinflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-10 in hippocampus, and relieve neuroinflammation and neuron loss. In addition, YHD could also regulate the expression of PU.1, TREM2, p-NF-κB P65 in the TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway. Further in vitro experiments, we found that YHD had a significant regulatory effect on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced BV-2 cell polarization, and it could significantly increase PU.1, TREM2, decrease p-NF-κB P65, <i>p</i>-IKKβ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β. At the same time, using siRNA to inhibit TREM2, it proved that TREM2 was a key target for YHD to promote Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced BV-2 cell M2 polarization to reduce neuroinflammation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>YHD could regulate the TREM2/NF-κB signaling pathway through TREM2, thereby to adjust MG polarization and reduce AD-related neuroinflammation.",2024,,"Wang K, Zan S, Xu J, Sun W, Li C, Zhang W, Ni D, Cheng R, Li L, Yu Z, Zhang L, Liu S, Cui Y, Zhang Y.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35800,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Herein, this study aims to develop hydrogel from native cellulose extracted from oil palm empty fruit bunches for dermal drug delivery with an emphasis on evaluating the effect of alkali solvent compositions on hydrogel formation. Unbleached dissolving pulps were solubilized in alkali solvents containing sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (6-8%w/v) and urea (4-6%w/v) before crosslinking. Hydrogels were loaded with ibuprofen for skin permeation studies. Light brownish hydrogels formed are aesthetically acceptable and biodegradable with low cytotoxicity. NaOH content has a dominant role over urea where thinner and deformable crosslinked network walls in a porous hydrogel structure are associated with high NaOH content. Synergistic effects (cellulose solubility: 94 %; swelling ratio: ~2800 %) were observed at 7%w/v NaOH and 4%w/v urea with low toxicity.

Starting with equimolar egg-phosphatidylcholine (PC)/cholesterol liposomes, the influence of the liposomal composition and surface charge on the incorporation and retention of a model poorly water soluble drug, ibuprofen was investigated. Both the incorporation and the release of ibuprofen were influenced by the lipid composition of the multi-lamellar vesicles (MLV) with inclusion of the long alkyl chain lipid (dilignoceroyl phosphatidylcholine (C24PC)) resulting in enhanced ibuprofen incorporation efficiency and retention. The cholesterol content of the liposome bilayer was also shown to influence ibuprofen incorporation with maximum ibuprofen incorporation efficiency achieved when 4 micromol of cholesterol was present in the MLV formulation. Addition of anionic lipid dicetylphosphate (DCP) reduced ibuprofen drug loading presumably due to electrostatic repulsive forces between the carboxyl group of ibuprofen and the anionic head-group of DCP. In contrast, the addition of 2 micromol of the cationic lipid stearylamine (SA) to the liposome formulation (PC:Chol - 16 micromol:4 micromol) increased ibuprofen incorporation efficiency by approximately 8%. However further increases of the SA content to 4 micromol and above reduced incorporation by almost 50% compared to liposome formulations excluding the cationic lipid. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was used to dynamically follow the changes in liposome morphology during dehydration to provide an alternative assay of liposome stability. ESEM analysis clearly demonstrated that ibuprofen incorporation improved the stability of PC:Chol liposomes as evidenced by an increased resistance to coalescence during dehydration.

Ethyl oleate (EO) was screened as the oil phase of microemulsions, due to a good solubilizing capacity of the microemulison systems and excellent skin permeation rate of ibuprofen. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams for microemulsion regions were constructed using ethyl oleate as the oil, Tween 80 as the surfactant, propylene glycol as the cosurfactant. Various microemulsion formulations were prepared and the abilities of various microemulsions to deliver ibuprofen through the skin were evaluated in vitro using Franz diffusion cells fitted with porcine skins. The in vitro permeation data showed that microemulsions increased the permeation rate of ibuprofen 5.72-30.0 times over the saturated solution. The optimum formulation consisted of 3% ibuprofen, 6% EO, 30% Tween 80/PG (2:1) and water, showed a high permeation rate of 38.06 microg cm(-2) h(-1). Xanthan gum as a gel matrix was used to construct the microemulsion-based hydrogel for improving the viscosity of microemulsion for topical administration.

Ibuprofen was chosen as the model drug. Four different formulations of ibuprofen nanostructured lipid carriers were prepared by melted-ultrasonic methods; gelucire 44/14 was screened as one of the solid lipid matrix materials due to the good particle size dispersion and excellent contribution to the corneal permeability of the model drug. The modified Franz-type diffusion cells and isolated corneas were used in the test of drug corneal permeability and the in vivo releasing tests were carried out using microdialysis method. gelucire 44/14 and transcutol P could enhance the corneal permeability by different mechanisms. The corresponding apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)) were 1.28 and 1.36 times more than that of the control preparation. Stearylamine could prolong the pre-cornea retention time of the model drug to some extent. Ibuprofen nanostructured lipid carriers displayed controlled-release property.

The three factors chosen for factorial design were the concentrations of drug, polyoxyethylene(5)cetyl/oleyl ether and ethanol and the levels of each factor were low, medium and high. Skin permeation rates and lag times of ibuprofen were evaluated using the Franz-type diffusion cell in order to optimize the gel formulation. The permeation rate of ibuprofen significantly increased in proportion to the drug concentration, but significantly decreased in proportion to POE(5)cetyl/oleyl ether concentration. Ethanol concentration was inversely proportional to the lag time. The pharmacokinetic properties of the optimized formulation were compared with those of two marketed products in rats.

Diffusion studies of saturated solutions in 50:50 water/ethanol of methyl paraben (MP), ibuprofen (IBU) and caffeine (CF) were performed on Carbosil membrane. The spectroscopic data were analysed by target factor analysis, and evolution profiles of the signal for each component (i.e. the drug, water, ethanol and membrane) over time were obtained. Results showed that the data were successfully deconvoluted as correlations between factors from the data and reference spectra of the components, were above 0.8 in all cases. Good reproducibility over three runs for the evolution profiles was obtained. From the evolution profiles it was observed that water diffused better through the Carbosil membrane than ethanol, confirming the hydrophilic properties of the Carbosil membrane used. IBU diffused slower compared with MP and CF. The evolution profile of CF was very similar to that of water, probably because of the high solubility of CF in water, indicating that both compounds are diffusing concurrently. The second part of the work involved a study of the evolution profiles of the components of a commercial topical gel containing 5% (w/w) of ibuprofen as it permeated through human skin.

Results are reported on the membrane preparation, physical properties, and drug elution profile of a model drug. The polymeric membranes were obtained with HP-beta-CD contents ranging from 0 to 33.4 wt%, by changing the composition of the casting solution, and were further impregnated with ibuprofen using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) in batch mode.

Initially porous/non-porous, ibuprofen/lidocaine/propranolol HCl-loaded systems were exposed to phosphate buffer pH 7.4 in agitated test tubes, varying the microparticle concentration from 5:1 to 20:1mg:mL. Interestingly, drug release was virtually unaffected by the ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratio in the case of initially porous, ibuprofen-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete drug release within about 1 week. Optical microscopy, SEM, DSC and pH measurements of the bulk fluid revealed no major impact of the microparticle concentration on the systems' properties within the first couple of days. However, a more rapid and pronounced decrease in the pH of the release medium occurred after 10-14 d at elevated ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratios. This resulted in an accelerated: (i) decrease in the glass transition temperature, (ii) microparticle agglomeration, and (iii) increase in the internal and external microparticle porosity. Importantly, this phenomenon did not significantly affect drug release from initially porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete release within about 18 d. In contrast, drug release became significantly faster at higher ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratios in the case of initially non-porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles and initially porous, propranolol HCl-loaded systems, exhibiting complete release after 1 and 2 months, respectively. Thus, depending on the type of system, the ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratio may or may not affect the observed release kinetics in vitro.

S-IB has a lower melting point (T(m)=54 degrees C) than RS-IB (T(m)=77 degrees C) and, therefore, a greater solubility (S-IB: 127+/-1 microg/mL; RS-IB: 81+/-1 microg/mL). Supersaturated plasters were prepared by using a poly(dimethylsiloxane) adhesive and Eugragit RL and propylene glycol as antinucleant agents. The in vitro skin permeation profiles were determined by Franz cells and human epidermis obtained from three different donors. The permeation profiles of S-IB from saturated solutions resulted statistically higher than those of RS-IB (p<0.002). When plasters were used, no differences were noticeable between the enantiomer and racemate (p>0.17). The latter unexpected results could be explained considering that the RS-IB or S-IB in vitro release rate constants, determined using 3% w/w or 6% w/w loaded plasters, were not statistically different, suggesting that the drug diffusivity within the adhesive matrix represented the rate limiting step to the skin absorption.",2010,,"Cilurzo F, Alberti E, Minghetti P, Gennari CG, Casiraghi A, Montanari L.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.10.053,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study aimed to investigate the applicability of BC membranes in topical or transdermal drug delivery systems. To assess its therapeutic feasibility, the permeation through human epidermis of two model drugs (lidocaine hydrochloride and ibuprofen) in BC and other formulation systems was compared in vitro. A uniform distribution of both drugs in the BC membranes was achieved. Diffusion studies with Franz cells showed that the incorporation of lidocaine hydrochloride in BC membranes provided lower permeation rates than those obtained with the conventional formulations. However, the results obtained with the lipophilic drug were quite different, since permeation of ibuprofen in BC was almost three times higher than that of the drug in the gel or in a PEG400 solution.

The primary surfactant was PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides (Labrasol). The cosurfactants were commercially available mixtures of octoxynol-12 and polysorbate 20 without or with the addition of PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil (Solubilisant gamma 2421 and Solubilisant gamma 2429, respectively). The oil phase of microemulsions was isopropyl myristate. Phase behaviour study of the pseudo-ternary systems Labrasol/cosurfactant/oil/water at surfactant-to-cosurfactant weight ratios (K(m)) 40:60, 50:50 and 60:40, revealed a strong synergism in the investigated tensides mixtures for stabilisation of microemulsions containing up to 80% (w/w) of water phase at surfactant +cosurfactant-to-oil weight ratio (SCoS/O) 90:10. Solubilization of a model drug ibuprofen in concentration common for topical application (5%, w/w) was achieved at the water contents below 50% (w/w). Drug free and ibuprofen-loaded microemulsions M1-M6, containing 45% (w/w) of water phase, were prepared and characterized by polarized light microscopy, conductivity, pH, rheological and droplet size measurements. In vitro ibuprofen release kinetics from the microemulsions was investigated using paddle-over-enhancer cell method and compared with the commercial 5% (w/w) ibuprofen hydrogel product (Deep Relief, Mentholatum Company Ltd., USA). The investigated microemulsions were isotropic, low viscous Bingham-type liquids with the pH value (4.70-6.61) suitable for topical application. The different efficiency of the tensides mixtures for microemulsion stabilisation was observed, depending on the cosurfactant type and K(m) value. Solubilisant gamma 2429 as well as higher K(m) (i.e., lower relative content of the cosurfactant) provided higher surfactant/cosurfactant synergism. The drug molecules were predominantly solubilized within the interface film. The amount of drug released from the formulations M3 (10.75%, w/w) and M6 (13.45%, w/w) (K(m) 60:40) was limited in comparison with the reference (22.22%, w/w) and follows the Higuchi model. Microemulsions M2 and M5 (K(m) 50:50) gave zero order drug release pattern and ∼15% (w/w) ibuprofen released. The release profiles from microemulsions M1 and M4 (K(m) 40:60) did not fit well with the models used for analysis, although the amounts of ibuprofen released (24.47%, w/w) and 17.99% (w/w), respectively) were comparable to that of the reference hydrogel.

Several attempts have been reported to improve the permeability of poorly soluble drug compounds using supersaturated systems, however, due to thermodynamic challenges, there was a high tendency for the drug to nucleate immediately after formulating or even during storage. The present study focuses on the efficiency of drug crystals at the submicron/nano range in presence of different solubilizers to improve the permeation rate. Effect of several solubilizers, e.g. Pluronic F-127, Vitamin E TPGS, propylene glycol were studied on the submicron suspension systems of ibuprofen as a model drug. Various stabilizers such as hydroxylpropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were examined to evaluate their crystal inhibitory effects on particle growth of the drug compound at submicron range. The overall permeation enhancement process through the skin seems to be influenced by the presence of solubilizers and also the presence of submicron drug crystal.

In order to get a sustained delivery of NSAIDs without burst, hydrogel degradable microspheres were prepared by co-polymerization of a methacrylic derivative of ibuprofen with oligo(ethylene-glycol) methacrylate and poly(PLGA-PEG) dimethacrylate as degradable crosslinker. Microspheres (40-100 μm) gave a low yield of ibuprofen release in saline buffer (≈2% after 3 months). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that intact ibuprofen was regenerated indicating that ester hydrolysis occurred at the carboxylic acid position of ibuprofen. Dialysis of release medium followed by alkaline hydrolysis show that in saline buffer ester hydrolysis occurred at other positions in the polymer matrix leading to the release of water-soluble polymers (>6-8000 Da) conjugated with ibuprofen showing that degradation and drug release are simultaneous. By considering the free and conjugated ibuprofen, 13% of the drug is released in 3 months. In vitro, ibuprofen-loaded MS inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 in articular cartilage and capsule explants challenged with lipopolysaccharides.

Afterwards, permeation and release studies were carried out. According to the permeation studies, the ibuprofen liposomal formulation supplemented with PEs exhibited similar therapeutic effects, but at lower doses (20%) comparing with a commercial formulation used as a reference. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the effect caused by PEs on the adsorption mechanism of liposomal formulations onto the skin.

However, The transdermal enhancement mechanism of iontophoresis was not well known. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of drugs and the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis was revealed in this study. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used as the models, including aspirin, ibuprofen and indomethacin. Their oil-water partition coefficients were measured. The carbomer-based hydrogels of them were prepared. Iontophoresis significantly enhanced in vitro transdermal delivery across the rat skins. Strong lipophilicity could lead to high permeation of drugs. However, the dissociation extent (indicated as pKa) of drugs was the key factor to determine the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis. The more dissociation the drugs were, the higher the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis. The drug-loaded hydrogels combined with iontophoresis improved the treatment of rat raw's inflammatory syndrome. Iontophoresis significantly improved the drugs penetrating into the hypodermis, dermis and epidermis, more deeply than the application of drugs alone according to the experimental result of 5-carboxylfluorescein hydrogels.

The ex vivo delivery of ibuprofen onto and across the skin was evaluated based on system specific drug release parameters such as steady state permeation rate, permeability coefficient, permeability enhancement ratio, skin/gel partition coefficient, diffusion coefficient, lag time and release rate constant and mechanisms of release were determined using mathematical models. Interaction between ibuprofen and chitosan produced new spherical eutectic nanoconjugates with remarkable decrease in particle size of ibuprofen from 4580 (length-to-breadth aspect ratio) to a minimum of 14.15 nm (324-times), and thermally stable amorphous characteristics.

Formulation study of pseudo-ternary system liquid lecithin/poloxamer 407/water at constant liquid lecithin/poloxamer 407 mass ratio (2.0) revealed that minimum concentrations of liquid lecithin and poloxamer 407 required for formation of gel like systems were 15.75% w/w and 13.13% w/w, respectively, while the maximum content of water was 60.62% w/w. The systems comprising water concentrations in a range from 55 to 60.62% w/w were soft semisolids suitable for topical application, and they were selected for physicochemical and biopharmaceutical evaluation. Analysis of conductivity results and light microscopy examination revealed that investigated systems were water dilutable dispersions of spherical oligolamellar associates of phospholipids and triglyceride molecules in the copolymer water solution. Rheological behavior evaluation results indicated that the investigated gels were thermosensitive shear thinning systems. Ibuprofen (5% w/w) was incorporated by dispersing into the previously prepared carriers. Drug-loaded systems were physically stable at storage temperature from 5 ± 3°C to 40 ± 2°C, for 30 days.

However there are ethical and safety issues associated with obtaining human tissue. For these reasons synthetic membranes, cell culture models or in silico predictive algorithms have been researched intensively as alternative approaches to predict dermal exposure in man. Porcine skin has also been recommended as an acceptable surrogate for topical or transdermal delivery research. Here we examine the in vitro permeation of a model active, ibuprofen, using human or porcine skin, as well as the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assay (PAMPA) model and silicone membrane. Finite dose studies were conducted in all models using commercial ibuprofen formulations and simple volatile ibuprofen solutions. The dose applied in the PAMPA model was also varied in order to determine the amount of applied formulation which best simulates typical amounts of topical products applied by patients or consumers. Permeation studies were conducted up to 6h for PAMPA and silicone and up to 48h for human and porcine skin. Cumulative amounts permeated at 6h were comparable for PAMPA and silicone, ranging from 91 to 136μg/cm(2) across the range of formulations studied. At 48h, maximum ibuprofen permeation in human skin ranged from 11 to 38μg/cm(2) and corresponding values in porcine skin were 59-81μg/cm(2). A dose of 1μL was confirmed as appropriate for finite dose studies in the PAMPA model. The formulation which delivered the greatest amount of ibuprofen in human skin was also significantly more efficient than other formulations when evaluated in the PAMPA model. The PAMPA model also discriminated between different formulation types (i.e. gel versus solution) compared with other models. Overall, the results confirm the more permeable nature of the PAMPA, silicone membrane and porcine tissue models to ibuprofen compared with human skin. Further finite dose studies to elucidate the effects of individual excipients on the barrier properties of the PAMPA model are needed to expand the applications of this model.

The gels were evaluated in-vitro (using both silicone membranes, and pig skin) and in-vivo in human volunteers. All gels showed consistent behaviour in a standard in vitro release test. The stratum corneum (SC) uptake and skin penetration of ibuprofen in vitro from the novel gels and the marketed formulations were generally comparable even though the drug loading in the TOCN-based vehicles was only 20% of that in the 'reference' products. In vivo, the new gels appeared to enhance drug uptake into the SC following a relatively short application time, again matching the performance of the commercial formulations.

One of the delivery routes for which these carriers can be applied is buccal administration. However, the liquid dispersions of lipid nanoparticles can be rapidly removed from oral cavity by saliva. Thus, the development of a system that allows increased retention time on the mucosa is necessary. For this reason, the development of mucoadhesive preparations for buccal administration of lipid nanoparticles becomes important. Hydrogels prepared with mucoadhesive polymers (Carbopol<sup>®</sup> 980 and polycarbophil) constitute a promising option. The aim of this work was to develop mucoadhesive buccal hydrogels with NLC, using ibuprofen as a model drug. The obtained results showed that the developed NLC dispersions presented particles in the nanometric size range, with low polydispersity index values and efficient ability for the entrapment of the model drug. Moreover, the incorporation of NLC in hydrogels of mucoadhesive polymers resulted in preparations with desirable rheological features as well as texture (firmness and adhesiveness) and mucoadhesive properties, which could benefit the therapeutic efficacy, by increasing the residence time and easiness for topical application in the buccal mucosa.

To this purpose we engineered liposomes using phosphatidylcholines, ceramides and cholesterol. The specific molar ratio of the three components was established after studying the mixing properties of the lipid monolayers of the lipid components formed at the air-water interface. Liposomes loaded and unloaded with ibuprofen and hyaluronic acid were characterized by quasi-elastic light scattering and fluorescence polarization. Optimized liposomes, with and without drugs, were applied onto human skin and the structures formed evaluated using atomic force microscopy.

Encapsulation of drugs into nanoparticles is proposed here as a promising tool for regulating drug crystallization in transdermal patches. The degree of recrystallization and transdermal permeation of ibuprofen and hydrocortisone loaded in polymeric and lipid nanoparticles from matrix-type transdermal patches were investigated. Ethyl cellulose (EC4), poly (lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) were employed for polymeric nanoparticle preparations; while medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and witepsol were used for the preparation of MCT nanoemulsion and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), respectively. As control, similar patches were prepared containing the free form of the investigated model drugs. All nanoparticle-containing transdermal patches exhibited less degree of drug recrystallization after 4 weeks compared to the control groups. Among the investigated nanocarriers, transdermal patches formulated with drug-loaded lipid nanoparticles showed the lowermost degree of recrystallization. Drug encapsulation into SLNs succeeded to reduce the degree of ibuprofen and hydrocortisone recrystallization from 23.3 ± 0.9 and 21.9 ± 1.2% to 0.2 ± 0.1 and 1.8 ± 0.1%, respectively. Additionally, the decreased crystalline fraction was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the drug flux through excised pig skin, which was found to be correlated to the hydrophobicity of the different nanocarriers. In conclusion, polymeric and lipid nanoparticles proved to be effective tools for the preparation of transdermal patches with on-demand drug loadings, while lowering the recrystallization risks.

The relationships between the linear and non-linear rheological properties and the main adhesive and biopharmaceutical properties of the prepared patches have been demonstrated. The higher the viscous component of the matrix, the lower its cohesiveness and the faster the drug release rate. The in vitro skin permeability of ibuprofen was not limited by the polymeric matrix, even if compared to the commercial reference product.

Seven drugs with different physicochemical parameters including clonidine (CLO), flurbiprofen (FLU), diclofenac (DIC), ibuprofen (IBU), zolmitriptan (ZOL), lidocaine (LID), tulobuterol (TUL) and the mixed adhesive (7:3, w/w) of Oppanol® B 15 N (M.W. = 108,000 Da) and Oppanol® N 50 (M.W. = 565,000 Da) were selected for in vitro drug release and skin permeation studies. Regression analysis was used to study the relationship between physicochemical parameters and release behaviors. The release behaviors of drugs were a negative correlation with polarizability and dipole moment per molecular volume (μ/V), which represented van der Waals and dipole-dipole interaction, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and molecular dynamics simulation were used to provide molecular details of the interaction between the drug and PIB. The free volume and molecular mobility of PIB were characterized using mechanical property tests, rheology study, MDSC and molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the above results, drugs with high polarizability and μ/V had stronger van der Waals and dipole-dipole interaction with PIB, reducing the free volume and molecular mobility of PIB, so that the drug struggled to release from PIB.

Mechanical strength tests demonstrated that IBU MNs formed pores both on Parafilm M® and human cadaver skin. IBU-MNs consisting of 0.23 %w/v and 0.49 %w/v LAP with 10 %w/v water showed ∼ 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> sustained drug permeation at 72 h in skin permeation experiments with flux of ∼ 40 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>/h.

Among the existing 3D printing techniques, direct powder extrusion (DPE) resulted as the most practical approach thanks to the possibility to directly process excipients and drugs in a single step. The main goal of this work was to determine whether different grades of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer might be employed as new feedstock materials for the DPE technique to manufacture transdermal patches. By selecting two model drugs with different thermal behavior, (i.e., ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium) we also wanted to pay attention to the versatility of EVA excipient in preparing patches for customized transdermal therapies. EVA was combined with 30 % (w/w) of each model drugs. The physicochemical composition of the printed devices was investigated through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analyses. FT-IR spectra confirmed that the starting materials were effectively incorporated into the final formulation, and thermal analyses demonstrated that the extrusion process altered the crystalline morphology of the raw polymers inducing the formation of crystals at lower thicknesses. Lastly, the drug release and permeation profile of the printed systems was evaluated for 48 h and showed to be dependent on the VA content of the EVA grade (74.5 % of ibuprofen released from EVA 4030AC matrix and 12.6 % of diclofenac sodium released from EVA1821A matrix). Hence, this study demonstrated that EVA and direct powder extrusion technique could be promising tools for manufacturing transdermal patches. By selecting the EVA grade with the appropriate VA content, drugs with dissimilar melting points could be printed preserving their thermal stability. Moreover, the desired drug release and permeation profile of the drug can be achieved, representing an important advantage in terms of personalized medicine.",2023,,"Maurizii G, Moroni S, Khorshid S, Aluigi A, Tiboni M, Casettari L.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2023.122720,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To achieve this, nonionic surfactants and three cosolvents were employed to develop new microemulsions (MEs) that contained IB as nanocarriers. The aim was to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of the drug after transdermal administration. The MEs were characterised by droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), and rheological properties. Furthermore, the flux of IB was evaluated by Franz diffusion cells using excised rat skin and in vivo bioavailability using rats. The results showed that the MEs had ideal viscosity and droplet size below 100 nm. Moreover, using the developed MEs, an improvement in the solubility (170 mg/mL) and flux through the rat skin (94.6 ± 8.0 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>.h) was achieved. In addition, IB demonstrated a maximum plasma level of 0.064 mg/mL after 8 h of transdermal administration in rats using the ME with an increase in the bioavailability of about 1.5 times in comparison to the commercial IB gel.

Traditionally, formulation development relies on empirical knowledge and trial-and-error experiments. In this paper, we introduced the Bayesian optimisation method and compared it with the traditional response surface methodology (RSM) for topical drug formulation. The objective was to optimise the formulation composition of ibuprofen gel-like to achieve a maximum flux through in vitro permeation tests (IVPTs). As a model system, poloxamer 407, ethanol, and propylene glycol (PG) were selected as the key excipients, whose concentrations were optimised. Strat-M membrane, serving as a surrogate for human skin, and Franz cell diffusion were employed in IVPTs. Two sets of experiments were conducted under identical conditions for 30 h.

Despite ongoing research, no United States Food and Drug administration (USFDA) approved drugs for OA are available. The current investigation explores the potential of glucosamine sulphate endorsed ibuprofen nanocrystals loaded polymeric gel (IBU-GS-NCs gel) for its anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying capabilities in the osteoarthritic rat model. IBU-GS-NCs were engineered by using the anti-solvent precipitation method that later exhibited particle size 34.57 ± 0.79 nm, zeta (ζ) potential -2.81 ± 0.6 mV, and drug content 7.05 ± 0.19 %. On the other hand, IBU-GS-NCs gel demonstrated 0.507 ± 0.029 % drug loading with spreadability and viscosity close to marketed diclofenac emulgel. Next, the amount of IBU infused through the rat skin in ex vivo permeation study from IBU-GS-NCs gel and IBU gel was calculated to be 479.59 ± 6.28 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> and 255.91 ± 4.44 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively after 24 h with 1.87-fold increment.

In contrast to the positive control, the representative radiograph for IBU-GS-NCs gel-treated osteoarthritic rats indicated regeneration of articular cartilage with the absence of osteophytes. Histological evaluation of IBU-GS-NCs gel illustrated marked recovery in articulate cartilage thickness as well as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) level.

The model integrates pressure-driven, coupled laminar flow through the MN lumen and skin tissue, employing the Beavers-Joseph interfacial condition at the HMN tip and skin interface to represent the transition between free flow (lumen) and porous regions (tissue). For modelling purposes, IBU is loaded into a porous tablet within the HMN reservoir, which, in practice, can increase the shelf life of the drug formulation and provide greater ease of handling. Drug transport in the system is modelled using the convection-diffusion equation for diluted species (i.e., ignoring any inter-species interactions) coupled with a pharmacokinetic component to predict systemic absorption of the drug. Parametric analyses have revealed that MN geometry, drug loading, and skin permeability significantly influence delivery efficiency. Notably, an increase in the drug-loaded tablet diameter leads to higher fluid velocity within the tablet, enhancing drug release. Among the key design parameters, the number of MNs and lumen diameter exhibit the strongest effect on the IBU (drug) permeability, with the permeability nearly doubling when the needle count increases four times from 9 to 36. In contrast, the pitch has a relatively minor impact. Inlet pressure emerges as a critical design factor: while higher pressures (e.g., 40 kPa) improve IBU permeability, they also reduce delivery control and compromise pharmacodynamic stability. The results indicate that maintaining moderate pressure levels enables a more balanced and sustained therapeutic effect, supporting the need for optimised delivery parameters tailored to specific drug characteristics and patient safety.",2025,,"Prakash R, Nadda R, Das DB, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2025.126309,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In fact, developing drug formulations with high encapsulation efficiency remains a challenging area of research, particularly in the context of targeted therapies that are often hindered by issues related to drug delivery. There is an emerging need for effective drugs with no adverse side effects that restrict their delivery. Several methods of drug encapsulation are available, including microencapsulation, liposomal encapsulation, polymer encapsulation, hydrogel encapsulation, and molecular encapsulation. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry has commercialized many encapsulated drugs, such as anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen, dexamethasone), high blood pressure drugs (valsartan, azilsartan), proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole), anti-cancer (carboplatin, carmustine, cisplatin, trastuzumab, cytarabine, paclitaxel, doxorubicin (DOX), vincristine) antiparasitic (amphotericin), antifungal (clotrimazole), and hormonal (melatonin (MLT))).

A ""standard experimental set-up"", in which the implants were directly exposed to well agitated phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was used, as well as set-ups, in which the implants were embedded within agarose hydrogels (mimicking living tissue). The gels were exposed to well agitated phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Ibuprofen-loaded implants were prepared by hot melt extrusion. The systems were thoroughly characterized before and during drug release by optical and scanning electron microscopy, gravimetric analysis, pH and solubility measurements as well as gel permeation chromatography. The bulk fluid was either completely or partially replaced by fresh medium at each sampling time point. In all cases, sink conditions were provided in the agitated bulk fluids throughout the experiments. Interestingly, the agarose set-ups did not show any noteworthy impact of the bulk fluid sampling volume on the observed drug release patterns, whereas complete fluid renewal in the ""standard set-up"" led to accelerated drug release. This could be explained by the considerable fragility of the implants once substantial polymer swelling set on, transforming them into PLGA <i>gels</i>: Complete fluid renewal caused partial disintegration and damage of the highly swollen systems, decreasing the lengths of the diffusion pathways for the drug. The mechanical stress is very much reduced at low sampling volumes, or if the implants are embedded within agarose gels.

Cupping therapy uses a tool to form a vacuum at certain points on the skin.<h4>Objectives</h4>We investigated the mechanism of pain relief caused by cupping therapy in primary dysmenorrhea that is played by cupping therapy in PD. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the cupping method on pain symptoms, changes in PGF2α, PGE, and β-endorphin levels, and uterine morphology in PD.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 35 female rats were divided into five groups (n = 7 rats per group): control, PD, dysmenorrhea treated with dry cupping (DC), dysmenorrhea treated with wet cupping (WC), and dysmenorrhea treated with ibuprofen (IB) as a standard drug. Pain was assessed by measuring the degree of writhing pain. Serum PGF2α, PGE, and β-endorphin levels were evaluated using ELISA. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to examine uterine morphology, such as thickness, vacuolization, and inflammation.<h4>Results</h4>WC had a pain normalization effect comparable to that of ibuprofen.

WC and DC have capabilities comparable to those of ibuprofen in improving uterine vacuolization and inflammation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results indicate that WC is more effective than DC in suppressing dysmenorrhea symptoms, modulating the hormone level ratio, and repairing uterine pathology.

However, recent studies have demonstrated the antiviral effects of niclosamide against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. In this study, we developed and validated a quantitative analysis method for the determination of niclosamide in rat and dog plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and used this method for pharmacokinetic studies. Biological samples were prepared using the protein precipitation method with acetonitrile. Ibuprofen was used as an internal standard. The mobile phase used to quantify niclosamide in rat or dog plasma consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate in distilled water-acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) or 5 mM ammonium acetate-methanol (30:70, v/v). An XDB-phenyl column (5 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm) and a Kinetex® C18 column (5 µm, 2.1 × 500 mm) were used as reverse-phase liquid chromatography columns for rat and dog plasma analyses, respectively. Niclosamide and ibuprofen were detected under multiple reaction monitoring conditions using the electrospray ionization interface running in the negative ionization mode. Niclosamide presented linearity in the concentration ranges of 1-3000 ng/mL (r = 0.9967) and 1-1000 ng/mL (r = 0.9941) in rat and dog plasma, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision values were < 7.40% and < 6.35%, respectively, for rat plasma, and < 3.95% and < 4.01%, respectively, for dog plasma. The intra- and inter-day accuracy values were < 4.59% and < 6.63%, respectively, for rat plasma, and < 12.1% and < 10.9%, respectively, for dog plasma. In addition, the recoveries of niclosamide ranged between 87.8 and 99.6% and 102-104% for rat and dog plasma, respectively. Niclosamide was stable during storage under various conditions (three freeze-thaw cycles, 6 h at room temperature, long-term, and processed samples). A reliable LC-MS/MS method for niclosamide detection was successfully used to perform pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs. Niclosamide presented dose-independent pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 0.3-3 mg/kg after intravenous administration, and drug exposure in rats and dogs after oral administration was very low. Additionally, niclosamide presented high plasma protein binding (>99.8%) and low metabolic stability. These results can be helpful for further developing and understanding the pharmacokinetic characteristics of niclosamide to expand its clinical use.",2021,,"Choi HI, Kim T, Lee SW, Woo Kim J, Ju Noh Y, Kim GY, Jin Park H, Chae YJ, Lee KR, Kim SJ, Koo TS.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.122862,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Statistical investigation of in vitro release revealed that the diffusion process was the main drug release mechanism and the Higuchi's model provided the best fit. In vivo studies showed the presence of ibuprofen in saliva (range 70-210 microg/ml) for 5 h and no irritation was observed.

Ibuprofen saturated solutions were prepared using 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 M disodium hydrogen phosphate solution (DHP). The solubility of ibuprofen in DHP increased as the molarity of DHP increased. Thus the four saturated solutions of ibuprofen (0.1M-DHP-IBU, 0.2M-DHP-IBU, 0.3M-DHP-IBU and 0.4M-DHP-IBU) have different concentrations of the same drug, and showed same pH (pH 7.0+/-1). The permeability study was also carried out using human epidermis and silastic membrane. Permeation rate of ibuprofen across rat epidermis and human epidermis from 0.4M-DHP-IBU was much greater than from 0.1M-DHP-IBU. The magnitudes of increase in the drug flux were 46.4-fold with rat epidermis and 9.4-fold with human epidermis. Such a great increase in drug flux was not observed with silastic membrane, only 1.4-fold. This suggests that the increased drug flux is likely due to drug-skin interaction and not the increased concentration of ibuprofen per se. Surface tension (ST) measurements of DHP versus ibuprofen concentration showed ST reduction of DHP, from 72 to 27.9 dyn/cm. This is an indication that ibuprofen acted as ionic surfactant and the observed skin permeability enhancement is attributed to disruption of stratum corneum barrier. Results of DSC study supported this assumption. DSC of untreated rat stratum corneum samples showed lipid transitions at 41.9+/-0.0 degrees C (T1), 55.1+/-1.6 degrees C (T(x)), 70.2+/-0.1 degrees C (T2) and 77.5+/-0.1 degrees C (T3), while those pretreated with 0.4M-DHP-IBU did not show the first three lipid transitions. Also, pretreatment of rat epidermis with 0.4M-DHP-IBU enhanced permeation of diclofenac sodium greater than 1250-fold. This corroborates that ibuprofen not only enhances its own permeation but also that of other drugs, such as diclofenac sodium.",2004,,Al-Saidan SM.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.08.011,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Aqueous ibuprofen solubility is dependent on pH increasing solubility when increasing pH. The very low aqueous solubility of ibuprofen can lead to a segregation of the drug in to microdomains and possible crystallization which will affect the release profile even leading to possible damage of the mucous membrane of the stomach. Therefore, homopolymers and copolymers of N-ethylmorpholine methacrylamide (EMA) and N, N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) hydrogels have been prepared to be applied as matrices for ibuprofen release as a method for minimizing these issues. The hydrogels were loaded with ibuprofen and the release over time was tested at 37°C and at different pH values: 2, 5 and 7.4. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) was performed in order to identify the stretching vibrations of the carbonyl group for each component. Dissolution of the ibuprofen from the formulations at different pHs was studied using the ATR-FTIR spectroscopic imaging. The results showed that for DMA hydrogels, most of ibuprofen was released as non crystalline ibuprofen at pH 7.4 but it was not able to prevent crystallization at pH 2 and 5. In contrast, the EMA hydrogels were able to prevent crystallization of the ibuprofen at all pHs.

Ibuprofen sodium was used as the model here and was successfully formulated at approximately 50% w/w in the dry state using the copolymer poly(methylvinylether/maleic acid). These MNs were robust and effectively penetrated skin in vitro, dissolving rapidly to deliver the incorporated drug. The delivery of 1.5mg ibuprofen sodium, the theoretical mass of ibuprofen sodium contained within the dry MN alone, was vastly exceeded, indicating extensive delivery of the drug loaded into the baseplates. Indeed in in vitro transdermal delivery studies, approximately 33mg (90%) of the drug initially loaded into the arrays was delivered over 24h. Iontophoresis produced no meaningful increase in delivery. Biocompatibility studies and in vivo rat skin tolerance experiments raised no concerns. The blood plasma ibuprofen sodium concentrations achieved in rats (263μgml(-1) at the 24h time point) were approximately 20 times greater than the human therapeutic plasma level. By simplistic extrapolation of average weights from rats to humans, a MN patch design of no greater than 10cm(2) could cautiously be estimated to deliver therapeutically-relevant concentrations of ibuprofen sodium in humans. This work, therefore, represents a significant progression in exploitation of MN for successful transdermal delivery of a much wider range of drugs.",2014,,"McCrudden MT, Alkilani AZ, McCrudden CM, McAlister E, McCarthy HO, Woolfson AD, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.02.007,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, often during the biodegradation process, these barriers trigger inflammation and cause a foreign body reaction with subsequent decrease in anti-adhesion efficacy. Here, a facile strategy comprising the incorporation of ibuprofen (IBU) into implantable membranes and its sustained release was proposed in order to improve anti-adhesion effects and neurological outcomes, namely to prevent failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). The combination of free IBU and a newly synthetized polymeric prodrug of IBU, namely poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with ester-linked IBU, was successfully used in order to reduce initial burst drug release and provide sustained drug release from fibrous membranes throughout several weeks. Such release profile was shown useful in preventing both acute and chronic inflammation in rats following laminectomy and membrane implantation. Moreover, histological analysis provided evidence of an excellent anti-adhesion effect, while associated neurological deficits were effectively reduced. Furthermore, the assessment of macrophage density, neovascularization, and related gene expression at the lesion site revealed that a sustained anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with the IBU-loaded proposed fibrous membranes. Results suggested that the COX2 pathway plays an important role in the development epidural fibrosis and arachnoiditis.

Here we demonstrate the strategy of enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) by designing a phosphorylated peptide-drug (IBF-HYD-GFFpY) precursor through the ester bond to release active drugs at the target site. Meanwhile, the in vivo assembly can be achieved by the catalysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the tear fluid for ocular drug delivery efficiently. The in vitro enzymatic experiments indicate that the dephosphorylation of IBF-HYD-GFFpY occurs firstly with the yield of IBF-HYD-GFFY which subsequently self-assembles into the supramolecular hydrogel to afford sustained drug release over 96 h. In the treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated Raw 264.7 macrophages, IBF-HYD-GFFpY exerts the more potent anti-inflammatory efficacy than that of free ibuprofen (IBF) at the concentration of 200 μM. Moreover, the aqueous solution of IBF-HYD-GFFpY via topical instillation hardly causes ocular irritation, and displays longer precorneal retention compared to the conventional eye drop formulation. In addition, in the in vivo study, a rabbit model of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) evidences the comparable therapeutic efficacy of IBF-HYD-GFFpY eye drops with that of clinically used 0.1 wt% diclofenac (DIC) sodium eye drops by the reduction of macrophage and leukocyte influx.

However, cell viability and subsequent tissue regeneration might be severely interfered with the unrestricted release and the locally excessive concentration of anti-inflammatory drugs. Herein, we report a double-layered membrane with sustained and uni-directional drug delivery features to prevent peritendinous adhesion without hampering the healing outcome. A vortex-assisted electrospinning system in combination with ibuprofen (IBU)-in-water emulsion was utilized to fabricate IBU-loaded poly-ʟ-lactic-acid (PLLA) fiber bundle membrane (PFB-IBU) as the anti-adhesion layer. The resultant highly porous structure, oleophilic and hydrophobic nature of PLLA fibers enabled in situ loading of IBU with a concentration gradient across the membrane thickness. Aligned collagen nanofibers were further deposited at the low IBU concentration side of the membrane for regulating cell growth and achieving uni-directional release of IBU. Drug release kinetics showed that the release amount of IBU from the high concentration side reached 79.32% at 14 d, while it was only 0.35% at the collagen side. Therefore, fibroblast proliferation at the high concentration side was successfully inhibited without affecting the oriented growth of tendon-derived stem cells at the other side. In vivo evaluation of the rat Achilles adhesion model confirmed the successful peritendinous anti-adhesion of our double-layered membrane, in that the macrophage recruitment, the inflammatory factor secretion and the deposition of pathological adhesion markers such as α-SMA and COL-III were all inhibited, which greatly improved the peritendinous fibrosis and restored the motor function of tendon.",2024,,"Deng J, Yao Z, Wang S, Zhang X, Zhan L, Wang T, Yu W, Zeng J, Wu J, Fu S, Wu S, Ouyang Y, Huang C.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2024.06.046,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Local and systemic effects of topically applied compounds can be significantly increased by plant constituents having skin penetration enhancers.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this study, we examined the proposed penetration enhancing properties of spilanthol, an N-alkylamide abundantly present in several Asteraceae plants like Spilanthes acmella L., on three model drugs (caffeine, testosterone and ibuprofen). Moreover, as plants are frequently contaminated with toxic environmental substances, the mutual influence on the transdermal behavior between spilanthol and six model mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fumonisin B1, citrinin, zearalenone, T-2 toxin) was investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Spilanthol exhibits component and concentration dependent penetration enhancing effects. No significant penetration enhancing effect for ibuprofen has been observed, but with increasing spilanthol concentration (from 0 up to 1w/V%), the permeability of caffeine increased, resulting in an enhancing ratio (ER) of 4.60. For testosterone, a maximal penetration enhancing concentration of 0.5% spilanthol was found (ER=4.13). Next to its beneficial applicability to increase local as well as systemic pharmacological effects of dermally co-administrated drug, this N-alkylamide negatively influences human health risk if spilanthol containing formulations are polluted with mycotoxins: the presence of spilanthol (0.3w/V%) induced a significant increase of permeability coefficient Kp of five investigated mycotoxins, with ER values ranging between 1.57 and 6.37.

No previous reports traced the mechanistic activity of this plant for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in relation to its chemical constituents.<h4>Aim of the study</h4>The present study was designed to substantiate the anti-arthritic potential of S. argel and identification of its secondary metabolites responsible for the action using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The air-dried powder of S. argel was subjected to liquid-liquid fractionation method to yield polar metabolites fraction (PMF) and nonpolar metabolites fraction (NPMF) where the metabolites that represent each fraction were identified using UPLC/HRMS. The in-vitro anti-arthritic effects of both fractions were tested using protein denaturation, membrane stabilization and proteinase inhibition assays, in addition to in-vitro enzyme inhibition assays of COXs, LOX and collagenases.

However, NSAIDs induce gastrointestinal damage, alter renal function, and decrease cardiovascular function, which could compromise thermoregulation and increase Tc. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of NSAIDs on Tc in exercising, adult humans.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, and Google Scholar for literature published up to November 2020. We conducted a quality assessment review using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Nine articles achieved a score ≥ seven to be included in the review.<h4>Results</h4>Seven studies found aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen had no effect (p > .05) on Tc during walking, running, or cycling for ≤ 90 min in moderate to hot environments. Two studies found significant Tc changes. In one investigation, 81 mg of aspirin for 7-10 days prior to exercise significantly increased Tc during cycling (p < .001); final Tc at the end of exercise = 38.3 ± 0.1 °C vs. control = 38.1 ± 0.1 °C. In contrast, participants administered 50 mg rofecoxib for 6 days experienced significantly lower Tc during 45 min of cycling compared to placebo (NSAID Tc range ≈ 36.7-37.2 °C vs control ≈ 37.3-37.8 °C, p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>There are limited quality studies examining NSAID effects on Tc during exercise in humans. The majority suggest taking non-selective NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin) 1-14 days before exercise does not significantly affect Tc during exercise. However, it remains unclear whether Tc increases, decreases, or does not change during exercise with other NSAID drug types (e.g., naproxen), higher dosages, chronic use, greater exercise intensity, and/or greater environmental temperatures.",2021,,"Emerson DM, Chen SC, Kelly MR, Parnell B, Torres-McGehee TM.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesf.2020.12.003,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen (IBU) represents one of the most widespread pharmaceuticals in surface waters and sediments in spite of the high removal rates occurring in conventional wastewater technologies. To assess the potentiality of phytoremediation in assisting these technologies, the screening of plant species for tolerance and removal ability of pollutants is a very important issue. In this study, the effects of different IBU concentrations on callus cultures of Populus nigra L., a pioneer tree species in the riparian ecosystem, were investigated. Results evidenced a notable tolerance of poplar cells to IBU, especially at high concentrations (IBU 30 mg L(-1)), which even stimulated growth. At this concentration, the ability to withstand IBU was accompanied by inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, reduction of lipid peroxide content and increase of membrane redox activity. Irrespective of initial IBU concentrations, a complete removal of this compound from the growth medium by poplar cells during a subculture occurred. Antioxidative enzyme activities and polyamine content were stimulated by IBU 0.03 mg L(-1), while no effect was found in cells exposed to IBU 30 mg L(-1), except for a decrease of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity.

It was found that all membranes with silica fouling showed more severe permeate flux decline at low pHs (3 and 5) than at high pHs (8 and 10) by the decomposition of nonionized silica particles to form a dense gel layer on membrane surfaces, which was hard to be removed by backwash. Silica fouling rendered the membrane surface considerably more hydrophilic, and only IBU, TRI and SMZ were adsorbed on membranes. Silica fouling on tight membranes (NF90 and XLE) can promote rejection of most PPCPs because the dense fouling layer could supply membrane with synergistic steric hindrance to reduce the transportation of PPCPs across membrane surface, implying that size exclusion is the dominating mechanism. While for loose NF270, electrostatic repulsion dominates by enhanced rejection of PPCPs as pH increased. Although fouling layer could provide extra steric hindrance for NF270, its effect was overwhelmed by the accompanied cake-enhanced concentration polarization phenomenon (CEOP). CEOP impeded back diffusion of PPCPs into the feed solution, trapped and accumulated PPCPs on membrane surface so as to increase their diffusion across membrane. At all pH levels, intermediate blocking and gel layer formation was the major fouling mechanism for tight and loose membrane, respectively.",2014,,"Lin YL, Chiou JH, Lee CH.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.01.023,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A computational assessment of the mechanism and thermodynamics of the adsorption of 18 most common pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenofibric acid, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, phenazone, primidone, propranolol, salicylic acid, tramadol) on four different CNMs (pristine/functionalised graphene and carbon nanotube) in two different solvents (water and n-octanol) was provided. We show that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on pristine CNMs is controlled by dispersion forces, π-interactions and hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand, adsorption on functionalised CNMs is controlled by hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how functionalization of CNM, CNM curvature and background solution properties modulate the intensity of non-covalent interactions and their contribution towards adsorption free energy. With this knowledge, we pinpoint functionalised graphene at environmental pH as the most effective setting for the removal of a given set of pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater.

However, microdiscectomy fails to address annulus fibrosus (AF) defects, increasing the risk of recurrent herniation. Current therapeutic strategies for this condition remain limited in efficacy. The lack of repair following injury and unresolved inflammation can further damage the IVD function, ultimately leading to irreversible IVD degeneration. Therefore, the development of an AF adhesive capable of both mechanically stabilizing annular fissures and enabling localized anti-inflammatory drug delivery emerges as a promising strategy to address this clinical challenge.<h4>Methods</h4>The developed AF adhesive system, designated as STIG, is formulated from silk fibroin, tannic acid, ibuprofen, and guanidine hydrochloride (GuCl). A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on STIG, encompassing its microstructure, composition, injectability, tissue adhesion, rheological properties, and biocompatibility. To assess anti-inflammatory efficacy, an <i>in vitro</i> inflammatory microenvironment is established via lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated AF cells. For <i>in vivo</i> validation, a rat model of IVD degeneration is surgically induced through puncturing the AF to simulate nucleus pulposus (NP) herniation. This experimental framework enables evaluation of STIG's ability to prevent NP protrusion, modulate inflammatory responses, and delay IVD degeneration.<h4>Results</h4>In the STIG system, GuCl serves the role of a hydrogen bond disruptor, facilitating its release into bodily fluids, which in turn allows for the reformation of hydrogen bonds. This property endows STIG with the ability to transition from an injectable, low-stiffness state to a high-stiffness adhesive gel upon contact with water. The inclusion of ibuprofen in the adhesive effectively curbs the production of inflammatory mediators and the breakdown of extracellular matrix constituents. In a rat tail model, STIG effectively preserves the NP water content, maintains the disc height index, and safeguards the structural integrity of the IVD post-surgery.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings highlight STIG's potential as a promising therapeutic solution for sealing AF fissures and preventing IVD degeneration.<h4>The translational potential of this article</h4>STIG shows significant clinical potential in spinal surgery.

However, little is known about its potential benefits in pain management. While current pharmacologic methods are effective in many cases, the associated side effects can limit their use. Non-pharmacological methods would minimize drug dependence, facilitating a reduction of the opioid burden. Green light therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing chronic pain in humans and rodents. However, its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. In this study, we demonstrate that green light exposure reduced postsurgical hypersensitivity in rats. Moreover, this therapy potentiated the antinociceptive effects of morphine and ibuprofen on mechanical allodynia in male rats. Importantly, in female rats, GLED potentiated the antinociceptive effects of morphine but did not affect that of ibuprofen. We showed that green light increases endogenous opioid levels while lessening synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation. Importantly, this study reveals new insights into how light exposure can affect neuroinflammation and plasticity in both genders. Clinical translation of these results could provide patients with improved pain control and decrease opioid consumption. Given the noninvasive nature of green light, this innovative therapy would be readily implementable in hospitals.

The majority of intercellular lipids are in a solid state at normal humidity (RH) and ambient temperature; however, several studies indicate that a small fraction exist in a fluid state.

A different change in the skin permeability related to the different lipid structures of the extracted lipids was suggested. To increase the knowledge of the specific role of different lipids on skin structure, a selective lipid modification is proposed. This study assess the effect of Ac on skin barrier lipids in-depth. Synchrotron based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR), which is used to study SC lipid organization, revealed a more ordered lipid organization after Ac treatment. In vitro experiments using Franz cells, which were selected to follow the SC barrier function capability, demonstrated that Ac-treated skin retained caffeine and ibuprofen on the SC with very low permeation of both compounds into the deeper skin layers. In vitro transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements revealed the ability of Ac to induce a less water permeated skin.

The conducted analyses reveal that the internal structure and total porosity of the resulting composites strongly depend on the catalyst which was used for silica precursor gelation. The parameters characterizing the porosity of both of the acid set composites are much lower than the parameters of the base set composites. Moreover, the basic catalyst supplied in the vapour phase does not affect the ibuprofen sodium molecules, whereas the acid one causes transformation of the ibuprofen sodium into the sodium chloride and a derivative of propanoic acid, which is poorly water soluble. The release profiles of ibuprofen sodium from composites demonstrate that there are differences in the rate and efficiency of drug desorption from them.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) has been shown to increase length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. Because the clinical behavior of PAF parallels that of inflammation following surgery, we investigated the effect of the inflammatory mediator arachidonic acid on the electrical behavior of normal atrial tissue in vitro and assessed the efficacy of the topical application of anti-inflammatory drugs at suppressing PAF in an animal model.<h4>Methods</h4>To study changes in electrical behavior from inflammation, the conduction properties of six normal canine right atrial appendages were quantified as a function of the direction of impulse propagation with and without 80 mum arachidonic acid. To study the effect of topical anti-inflammatory drugs, 24 adult mongrel dogs were prepared according to the model of sterile talc pericarditis. Nine dogs received talc alone (T), seven received talc combined with 600 mg ibuprofen (T + I), and eight received talc combined with 10 mg methylprednisolone (T + M). Three days following preparation, programmed electrical stimulation was performed to quantify conduction characteristics and to attempt the induction of atrial fibrillation (AF).<h4>Results</h4>In vitro, arachidonic acid produced an anisotropic and rapidly reversible 36.1 +/- 3.4% (P = 0.01) decrease in conduction velocity transverse to the long axis only. In vivo, both ibuprofen and methylprednisolone significantly reduced the incidence of sustained AF (from 56 to 0% T + I and 12% T + M, respectively, P = 0.02). No differences in conduction velocities or refractory periods were seen during sinus rhythm among the groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Acute inflammation as mimicked by arachidonic acid slows conduction anisotropically, mainly transverse to the long axis of the atrial myocardial fibers.

Although the etiopathogenesis of BD remains unknown, immune-mediated mechanisms play a major role in the development of the disease. BD patients present leukocyte infiltration in the mucocutaneous lesions as well as neutrophil hyperactivation. In contrast to neutrophils, whose involvement in the pathogenesis of BD has been extensively studied, the biology of monocytes during BD is less well known. In this study, we analyzed the phenotype and function of circulating monocytes of 38 BD patients from Hospital of Braga. In addition, we evaluated the impact of inflammatory and metabolomic plasma environment on monocyte biology. We observed a worsening of mitochondrial function, with lower mitochondrial mass and increased ROS production, on circulating monocytes of BD patients. Incubation of monocytes from healthy donors with the plasma of BD patients mimicked the observed phenotype, strongly suggesting the involvement of serum mediators. BD patients, regardless of their symptoms, had higher serum pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IP-10 levels and IL-1β/IL-1RA ratio. Untargeted metabolomic analysis identified a dysregulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism on BD patients, where a significant reduction of phospholipids was observed concomitantly with an increase of lysophospholipids and fatty acids. These observations converged to an enhanced phospholipase A2 (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activation. Indeed, inhibition of PLA<sub>2</sub> with dexamethasone or the downstream cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme with ibuprofen was able to significantly revert the mitochondrial dysfunction observed on monocytes of BD patients.

These samples were collected from Indian and KSA local supermarkets to ensure consistency in their therapeutic effects.<h4>Methods</h4>EOs were extracted from Indian and KSA <i>A. subulatum</i> fruit samples using a hydro-distillation method and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>) was determined using minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration methods. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were determined using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-induced free radical assay, and a bovine albumin inhibitory assay, respectively. These analyses were performed to evaluate the pharmacological activities of the substances.<h4>Results</h4>GC-MS retention times of both samples demonstrated 56 bioactive ingredients with different percentages.

The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices. Therefore, the development of an inhalable formulation with high bioavailability in the lungs was the leitmotiv of our investigation. The hypertonic ibuprofen solution to be nebulized (NIH) presents great relevant characteristics: bactericidal, virucidal, mucolytic and has a known anti-inflammatory property. Bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection. Our preliminary results indicate that the presence of this high ionic strength solution reduces 10 times the amount of ibuprofen necessary to kill bacteria, but also the time to kill 1x10<sup>6</sup> bacteria, from 4 h (in its absence) to only three minutes (in its presence). That was observed using Pseudomona aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia. Also, ""in vitro'' ibuprofen demonstrated virucidal activity against the so-called enveloped virus, a family that includes coronavirus strain (2019-nCoV). We observed too, the markedly reduced local inflammation in the airways after administering NIH lays on its ability to inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase and to markedly diminish reactive oxygen species (ROS). Other investigators also showed the importance of actin in the rapid spread of virus infection. Furthermore, reorganization of the actin filaments is a key step in lung inflammation induced by systemic inflammatory responses caused by SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that the interaction between actin proteins and S1 is involved in the 2019-nCoV infection and pathogenesis. Consequently, the possibility of interfering in this interaction could represent a valid hypothesis for the development of promising therapeutic and prevention strategies.

Translocation of effector proteins by the type III secretion systems depends on close contact between microbial and host cells. Our finding that both the ExoU-producing PA103 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its mutant obtained by deletion of exoU adhered poorly to endothelial cells (EC) led to the hypothesis that, in some cells, the amount of injected toxin may not be enough to induce cell lysis but cells would suffer from a long-term effect of ExoU intoxication. To address this question, cells were exposed to both bacteria for 1 h and then treated with gentamicin-containing medium, to eliminate infecting microorganisms. After 24 h, the percentage of viable EC in PA103-infected cultures was significantly lower than in cultures exposed to the mutant, as determined by the MTT assay. Cell death was not likely to depend on the ExoU lytic activity since cell labeling with propidium iodide was similar in cultures infected with both bacterial strains. Bacterial cytotoxicity was significantly reduced by MAFP, a specific inhibitor of cPLA2 and iPLA2. Since the PLA2 activity on membrane phospholipids generates free fatty acid, including arachidonic acid (AA), we next compared the bacterial ability to release AA from infected EC. PA103 was shown to induce a potent AA release that was inhibited by MAFP. AA oxidation by oxygenases generates eicosanoids, known to induce both cell death and proliferation. However neither inhibitors of cyclooxygenases (ibuprofen) nor lipoxygenases (NDGA) reduced the ExoU toxicity. Since non-enzymatic oxidation of AA generates reactive radicals, we next investigated the PA103 ability to induce oxidative stress in infected cells. FACS analysis of cell labeling with the C-11 fluor probe and with anti-4-hydroxynonel antibody revealed a significant peroxidation of cell membrane lipids. These results, together with our finding that PA103-infected EC death was significantly attenuated by alpha-tocopherol, led to the conclusion that AA-induced oxidative stress may be another mechanism of cell damage in the course of infection by ExoU-producing P. aeruginosa.",2006,,"Saliba AM, de Assis MC, Nishi R, Raymond B, Marques Ede A, Lopes UG, Touqui L, Plotkowski MC.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2005.07.011,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

During the adrenergic stimulation of brown adipocytes, free fatty acids generated from lipolysis activate UCP1 via an unclear interaction. Here, we set out to characterise activator binding to purified UCP1 to clarify the activation process, discern novel activators and the potential to target UCP1.<h4>Methods</h4>We assessed ligand binding to purified UCP1 by protein thermostability shift analysis, which unlike many conventional approaches can inform on the binding of hydrophobic ligands to membrane proteins. A detailed activator interaction analysis and screening approach was carried out, supported by investigations of UCP1 activity in liposomes, isolated brown fat mitochondria and UCP1 expression-controlled cell lines.<h4>Results</h4>We reveal that fatty acids and other activators influence UCP1 through a specific destabilising interaction, behaving as transport substrates that shift the protein to a less stable conformation of a transport cycle. Through the detection of specific stability shifts in screens, we identify novel activators, including the over-the-counter drug ibuprofen, where ligand analysis indicates that UCP1 has a relatively wide structural specificity for interacting molecules. Ibuprofen successfully induced UCP1 activity in liposomes, isolated brown fat mitochondria and UCP1-expressing HEK293 cells but not in cultured brown adipocytes, suggesting drug delivery differs in each cell type.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings clarify the nature of the activator-UCP1 interaction and demonstrate that the targeting of UCP1 in cells by approved drugs is in principle achievable as a therapeutic avenue, but requires variants with more effective delivery in brown adipocytes.",2022,,"Cavalieri R, Hazebroek MK, Cotrim CA, Lee Y, Kunji ERS, Jastroch M, Keipert S, Crichton PG.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2022.101526,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Cisplatin (CDDP) is a representative platinum drug in the treatment of breast cancer, however, its therapeutic application is often constrained by systemic toxicity and the frequent onset of chemoresistance. Here, we introduce a novel charge-adaptive nanoprodrug system, referred to as PP@, engineered to respond to tumor-specific conditions. This platform was constructed by conjugating ibuprofen and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic termini of an amphiphilic dendrimer, respectively, enabling the formation of uniform and stable nanostructures through spontaneous self-assembly. Importantly, PP@ undergoes charge reversal in response to acidic pH and elevated glutathione levels (GSH), facilitating deeper tumor penetration. Cisplatin was subsequently encapsulated within the nanoprodrug to yield the PP@-based CDDP nanoformulation (PP@CDDP). The physicochemical properties and therapeutic performance of PP@CDDP were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrated that PP@CDDP significantly improves cellular uptake, suppresses drug efflux, and reduces intracellular GSH levels, collectively contributing to prolonged drug retention at the tumor site. In vivo studies further confirmed that PP@CDDP significantly improved the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin, as evidenced by marked inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis, along with a favorable safety profile. These results underscore the potential of this charge-adaptive nanoprodrug platform to address key limitations of traditional cisplatin chemotherapy. The rational integration of smart material design with pharmacological strategies offers a promising pathway for improving therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.",2025,,"Xie G, Zhao W, Liu Q, Wang B, Feng R, Sun H, Cong M.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtbio.2025.102228,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study, electrospun blend fibers were produced from polyethylene oxide (PEO) and ethyl cellulose (EC) at various compositions to encapsulate a poorly water-soluble drug of ibuprofen (IBP) at 30% loading. Microscopic evaluation showed smooth and defect-free fiber morphologies for blank and IBP-loaded PEO/EC fibers. The average fiber diameters and fiber yields suggested a potential optimization on the blend fiber composition for the electrospun drug-eluting PEO/EC fibers, where the highest average fiber diameter and fiber yield occurred at 50PEO/50EC fiber composition. Surface wettability studies demonstrated the effects on surface hydrophobicity from blend fibers of water-soluble PEO and hydrophobic EC as well as the incorporation of IBP. In addition, blend fibers containing more PEO promoted the water absorption rates through dissolution of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, results from mechanical testing of the blend fibers showed the highest fiber elastic modulus and tensile strength at fiber compositions in between 75PEO/25EC and 50PEO/50EC, corresponding to the average fiber diameter measurements. The in vitro IBP release rates demonstrated a dependence on the EC compositions supported by the surface wettability and water absorption rate studies. In general, our work demonstrated the ability to electrospin blank and IBP-loaded PEO/EC fibers with the scientific understandings of EC compositions on modulations of fiber physicomechanical properties and in vitro drug release rates.

It also serves as an agonist for the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR109A. Nicotinic acid is widely used at high doses as a lipid-lowering drug, which is associated with an ocular side effect known as niacin maculopathy. Here we investigated the mechanism by which nicotinate is transferred into retina across the inner blood-retinal barrier (BRB). In vivo the blood-to-retina transport of [(3)H]-nicotinate was studied using the carotid artery injection technique. The characteristics of nicotinate transport at the inner BRB were examined in a conditionally immortalized rat retinal capillary endothelial cell line (TR-iBRB2), an in vitro model of inner BRB. The expression of transporters in TR-iBRB2 cells was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In vivo [(3)H]-nicotinate uptake by the retina was 5.4-fold greater than that of [(14)C]-sucrose, a BRB impermeable vascular space marker. Excess amounts of unlabeled nicotinate and salicylate significantly decreased the in vivo retinal uptake of [(3)H]-nicotinate. [(3)H]-Nicotinate was taken up by TR-iBRB2 cells via an H(+)-dependent saturable process with a Michaelis constant of ~7 mM. Na(+) had minimal effect on the uptake. The H(+)-dependent uptake was significantly inhibited by endogenous monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate, and monocarboxylic drugs such as valproate, salicylate, and ibuprofen. These characteristics are consistent with those of H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 mRNAs were expressed in TR-iBRB2 cells. The Na(+)-dependent monocarboxylate transporters SMCT1 and SMCT2 were not expressed in these cells. In conclusion, transfer of nicotinate from blood to retina across the inner BRB occurs primarily via H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporters.",2011,,"Tachikawa M, Murakami K, Martin PM, Hosoya K, Ganapathy V.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mvr.2011.06.009,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Abeta is believed to cause Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that a link may exist between the two diseases. If AD and sIBM are linked, then treatments that lower Abeta in brain may prove useful for sIBM. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress APP in skeletal muscle were treated for 6 months with a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; naproxen, ibuprofen, carprofen or R-flurbiprofen), a subset of which reduce Abeta in brain and cultured cells.

We tested the hypothesis that dendritic degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampal area resulting from seizure-induced neurotoxicity is modulated by cerebral oxidative damage. Kainic acid (KA, 1 nmol/5 microl) was injected intracerebroventricularly to C57Bl/6 mice. F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) and F4-neuroprostanes (F4-NeuroPs) were used as surrogate measures of in vivo oxidative stress and biomarkers of lipid peroxidation. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was quantified by evaluating citrulline level and pyramidal neuron dendrites and spines were evaluated using rapid Golgi stains and a Neurolucida system. KA produced severe seizures in mice immediately after its administration and a significant (p<0.001) increase in F2-IsoPs, F4-NeuroPs and citrulline levels were seen 30 min following treatment. At the same time, hippocampal pyramidal neurons showed significant (p<0.001) reduction in dendritic length and spine density. In contrast, no significant change in neuronal dendrite and spine density or F2-IsoP, F4-NeuroPs and citrulline levels were found in mice pretreated with vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol, 100mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 days, or with N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN, 200mg/kg, i.p.) or ibuprofen (inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, COX, 14 microg/ml of drinking water) for 2 weeks prior to KA treatment.

Epidemiological studies have suggested that long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy reduces the risk for Alzheimer's disease; however, the mechanism remains unknown. We report that a 9-month treatment of aged R1.40 mice resulted in 90% decrease in plaque burden and a similar reduction in microglial activation. Ibuprofen treatment reduced levels of lipid peroxidation, tyrosine nitration, and protein oxidation, demonstrating a dramatic effect on oxidative damage in vivo. Fibrillar β-amyloid (Aβ) stimulation has previously been demonstrated to induce the assembly and activation of the microglial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase leading to superoxide production through a tyrosine kinase-based signaling cascade. Ibuprofen treatment of microglia or monocytes with racemic or S-ibuprofen inhibited Aβ-stimulated Vav tyrosine phosphorylation, NADPH oxidase assembly, and superoxide production. Interestingly, Aβ-stimulated Vav phosphorylation was not inhibited by COX inhibitors. These findings suggest that ibuprofen acts independently of cyclooxygenase COX inhibition to disrupt signaling cascades leading to microglial NADPH oxidase (NOX2) activation, preventing oxidative damage and enhancing plaque clearance in the brain.",2012,,"Wilkinson BL, Cramer PE, Varvel NH, Reed-Geaghan E, Jiang Q, Szabo A, Herrup K, Lamb BT, Landreth GE.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.06.014,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In many reports, NSAIDs have induced apoptosis in a variety of cell lines such as colon cancer cells. On the other hand, more recently a few reports have found that NSAIDs protect against apoptosis. Here we investigate endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells. The aim of this study is to examine the involvement of NSAIDs, in particular diclofenac, on ER-stress-induced apoptosis of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Diclofenac significantly suppressed SH-SY5Y cell death induced by two types of ER-stress-inducing agents: thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and tunicamycin, a glycosylation blocker. Other NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, ibuprofen, aspirin, and ketoprofen, also suppressed ER-stress-induced SH-SY5Y cell death. The dose-dependent anti-apoptotic effect of diclofenac did not correlate with the reduction of prostaglandin release. Administration of prostaglandin E2, which was a primary product of arachidonic metabolism, showed no effects against anti-apoptotic effects produced by diclofenac. Thapsigargin and tunicamycin each significantly activated caspase-3, -9, and -2 in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. Diclofenac suppressed the activation of caspases induced by both ER stresses. Thapsigargin and tunicamycin decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in SH-SY5Y cells. Diclofenac suppressed the mitochondrial depolarization induced by both ER stresses. Diclofenac inhibited ER-stress-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells by suppressing the activation of caspases in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Here, we investigated the role of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) in brain phospholipids for neuronal survival. We used organotypic cultures of rat brain hippocampal slices exposed to 40 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation, to study the consequences of experimental ischemia. In [14C]docosahexaenoic acid-labeled cultures, oxygen-glucose deprivation induced significant release of radioactive docosahexaenoic acid. This release could be blocked by the selective inhibitor of the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2, 4-bromoenol lactone (10 microM), when it was added 30 min prior to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Addition of 4-bromoenol lactone at 30 min prior to oxygen-glucose deprivation markedly decreased the neuronal damage induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation. The protective effect was substantially higher in dentate gyrus than in CA1 and CA3 areas. Enrichment of the hippocampal tissue with docosahexaenoic acid by incubation with 10 microM docosahexaenoic acid for 24 h exerted the same neuroprotective effect, which was observed after treatment with 4-bromoenol lactone. In contrast to the 24 h-preincubation, simultaneous addition of docosahexaenoic acid with the onset of oxygen-glucose deprivation had no protective effect. This suggests that incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid into phospholipids is required for the protective effect observed. Then the possible involvement of arachidonic acid metabolism in docosahexaenoic acid-induced neuroprotection was tested. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by ibuprofen produced no change in neuroprotection after 24-h incubation of the hippocampal slices with docosahexaenoic acid. Simultaneous inhibition of Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent phospholipases A2 by treatment with the general phospholipase A2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (3 microM, 30 min prior to oxygen-glucose deprivation) resulted in significant enhancement of the neuroprotective effect in the dentate gyrus, but not in the CA1 and CA3 areas. In summary, the results reported here indicate that docosahexaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid-containing phospholipids provide potent protection against neurodegeneration after hypoxia/hypoglycemia.

In diffuse brain-injured rats, a chronic sensory sensitivity to whisker stimulation models the agitation of TBI survivors and provides anatomical landmarks across the whisker-barrel circuit to evaluate post-traumatic neuropathology. As a consequence of TBI, acute and chronic microglial activation can contribute to degenerative and reparative events underlying post-traumatic morbidity. Here we hypothesize that a temporal sequence of microglial activation states contributes to the circuit pathology responsible for post-traumatic morbidity, and test the hypothesis by examining microglial morphological activation and neuroinflammatory markers for activation states through gene expression and receptor-binding affinity. Adult male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a single moderate midline fluid percussion injury (FPI) or sham injury. Microglial activation was determined by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and receptor autoradiography in the primary somatosensory barrel field (S1BF) and ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus at 7 and 28 days following FPI. Morphological changes indicative of microglial activation, including swollen cell body with thicker, shrunken processes, were evident in S1BF and VPM at 7 and 28 days post-injury. Principally at 7 days post-injury in VPM, general inflammatory gene expression (major histocompatibility complex I, major histocompatibility complex II, translocator protein 18 kDa [TSPO]) is increased above sham level and TSPO gene expression confirmed by receptor autoradiography. Further, CD45, a marker of classical activation, and TGF-βI, an acquired deactivation marker, were elevated significantly above sham at 7 days post-injury. Daily administration of the anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (20mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the expression of these genes. Evidence for alternative activation (arginase 1) was not observed. Thus, these data demonstrate concomitant classical activation and acquired deactivation phenotypes of microglia in diffuse TBI in the absence of overt contusion or cavitation.

Sodium salicylate, a COX-2 inhibitor, can induce tinnitus in high doses. Hyperactivity of DCN neurons is observed in several animal models of tinnitus, including salicylate-induced tinnitus. The DCN presents several forms of endocannabinoid (EC)-dependent synaptic plasticity and COX-2 can also participate in the oxidative degradation of ECs. We recently demonstrated that short-term perfusion of sodium salicylate and other inhibitors of both oxidative and hydrolytic EC degradation did not affect depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a form of EC-dependent short-term synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that prolonged incubation with high doses of sodium salicylate (1.4 mM) enhances DSE of synapses onto glycinergic DCN interneurons but not those innervating glutamatergic DCN fusiform neurons. This effect was not reproduced with lower doses of salicylate (140 µM) or with ibuprofen, another inhibitor of COX-2. This effect was not observed in the presence of AM251, an antagonist/inverse agonist of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, showing that it was dependent on EC release. Finally we demonstrated that incubation with salicylate potentiated the increase in intracellular calcium during the depolarization.

Fiber supplementation did not significantly alter LBP concentration or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity in the overall cohort. However, in a subgroup of individuals with elevated baseline LBP concentrations, fiber supplementation significantly reduced LBP from 9.27 ± 3.52 to 7.02 ± 2.32 µg/mL (P = .003).

Local permeation of these agents has been one of the major concerns. Here we propose an approach to predict the permeability of topically applied agents for oral cancer chemoprevention. In theory, the total flux through the oral mucosa (Jmax) can be estimated by adding the transcellular flux (JTC) and the paracellular flux (JPC). To target the Cox-2 enzyme in oral epithelial cells, it is desirable to maximize the theoretical activity index, the ratio of JTC and IC50 of a Cox-2 inhibitor (JTC/IC50-Cox-2). Among the 12 commonly used NSAIDs, celecoxib, nimesulide and ibuprofen had the highest values and may be the agents of choice to target Cox-2 in oral epithelial cells through topical application. Based on these calculations, a long-term chemopreventive experiment using celecoxib (3% or 6%) through topical application was performed in a DMBA induced hamster oral cancer model.

The present study performed a comprehensive analysis of gene/protein expression induced by a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib, compared with a non-selective COX inhibitor, ibuprofen, and placebo in a clinical model of acute inflammatory pain (the surgical extraction of impacted third molars) using microarray analysis followed by quantitative RT-PCR verification and Western blotting. Inhibition of COX-2 modulated gene expression related to inflammation and pain, the arachidonic acid pathway, apoptosis/angiogenesis, cell adhesion and signal transduction. Compared to placebo, rofecoxib treatment increased the gene expression of ANXA3 (annexin 3), SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2), SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) and IL1RN (IL1 receptor antagonist) which are associated with inhibition of phospholipase A(2) and suppression of cytokine signaling cascades, respectively. Both rofecoxib and ibuprofen treatment increased the gene expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators, IL6 and CCL2 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 2), following tissue injury compared to the placebo treatment. These results indicate a complex role for COX-2 in the inflammatory cascade in addition to the well-characterized COX-dependent pathway, as multiple pathways are also involved in rofecoxib-induced anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects at the gene expression level.

While clinical reports indicate an important role of cytokines in inflammatory pain, methodological limitations have made systematic human studies difficult. This study examined the utility of a human in vivo bioassay combining microdialysis with multiplex immunoassay techniques for measuring cytokine arrays in tissue. The first experiment measured cytokines in interstitial fluid collected from non-inflamed and experimentally inflamed skin (UVB). The effects of noxious heat on cytokine release were also assessed. The second experiment examined whether anti-hyperalgesic effects of the COX-inhibitor ibuprofen were associated with decreased tissue levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6. In the first experiment, inflammation significantly increased IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, G-CSF, and MIP-1 beta. Noxious heat but not experimental inflammation significantly increased IL-7 and IL-13. In the second experiment, an oral dose of 400 and 800 mg ibuprofen produced similar anti-hyperalgesic effects suggesting a ceiling effect.

These results support the utility of explored method for tracking cytokines in human tissue and suggest that anti-hyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of ibuprofen are at least partially dissociated. The data further suggest that high clinical doses of ibuprofen exert anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulating tissue cytokine levels.

The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen​​​​​​ and worsening of infections.

Identifying the dehydration event using < 1μg of material is an increasingly important challenge. Atomic Force Microscopy indentation mapping is implemented at controlled temperatures between 25-100°C, for nanoscale volumes of hydrated APIs exhibiting distinct dehydration behavior and anhydrous APIs as controls. For caffeine hydrate and azithromycin dihydrate, the relative mechanical modulus increases ~10-fold at dehydration temperatures. These are confirmed by conventional macroscopic measurements including Variable Temperature Powder X-ray Diffraction, Thermogravimetric Analysis, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Conversely, no such mechanical transition is observed for anhydrous ibuprofen or a proprietary anhydrous compound.

Studies showed that the regular use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs might reduce disease progression risk for prostate cancer patients with prostate cancer. We evaluated the effects of ectopic expression of p53 on the biological functions of ibuprofen and diclofenac.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>For this purpose, We investigated cell death decision pathways related to survival and aggressive cellular phenotypes such as extrinsic/intrinsic apoptosis decision, Protein Kinase B/ Forkhead box O (AKT/FoxO) axis, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition) in wild type and p53 + PC3 prostate cancer cells.<h4>Results and conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen (1 mM) and diclofenac (250 μM) effectively induced cell cycle arrest and led to apoptosis <i>via</i> modulating both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, diclofenac was the only drug to generate ROS intermediates. Diclofenac triggered a typical EMT process with downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail in PC3 cells, regardless of p53 expression. In conclusion, although both drugs are effective on cell death mechanism, only diclofenac caused EMT because of increased ROS generation independent of p53. On the other hand, ibuprofen could inhibit metastasis <i>via</i> upregulating E-cadherin.

Both PGHS isoforms are integral membrane proteins and their substrate fatty acids readily partition into membranes, but the impact of phospholipids and lipid membranes on COX catalysis and the actions of COX inhibitors are not well understood. We have characterized the COX kinetics and ibuprofen inhibition of the purified PGHS isoforms in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) with varying acyl chain structure and physical state. PC was found to directly inhibit COX activity, with non-competitive inhibition by PC monomers binding away from the COX active site and competitive inhibition by micellar/bilayer forms of PC due to sequestration of the arachidonate substrate. Competitive inhibition by native membranes was observed in a comparison of COX kinetics in sheep seminal vesicle microsomes before and after solubilization of PGHS-1. PC liposomes significantly increase the inhibitory potency of ibuprofen against both PGHS isoforms without changing the reversible character of ibuprofen action or requiring binding of PGHS to the liposomes.

Previous studies suggest that the activation threshold and magnitude of the HS response may be modified by treatment with arachidonic acid (AA). We analyzed the effect of exogenous AA and its metabolites, PGE(2), LTD(4), and 15-HETE on HSF-1-dependent gene expression in A549 human respiratory epithelial-like cells. When added at 1microM, PGE(2) much more than LTD(4), but not 15-HETE increased activity of a synthetic HSF-1-dependent reporter after HS exposure (42 degrees C for 2h), but had no effect in the absence of HS. Exposing A549 cells to HS stimulated the release of PGE(2) and treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, reduced HS-induced HSF-1-dependent transcription. PGE(2) increased HS-induced HSP72 mRNA and protein expression but EMSA and Western blot analysis failed to show an effect on HSF-1 DNA binding activity or post-translational modification.

Even for early-stage lung cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy yields merely slight increase to patient survival. EF-hand domain-containing protein D2 (EFHD2) has recently been implicated in recurrence of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, we investigated the correlation between EFHD2 and chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression of EFHD2 was significantly associated with poor overall survival of NSCLC patients with chemotherapy in in silica analysis. Ectopic EFHD2 overexpression increased cisplatin resistance, whereas EFHD2 knockdown improved chemoresponse. Mechanistically, EFHD2 induced the production of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and in turn the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), consequently activating membrane expression of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) for drug efflux. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen suppressed EFHD2 expression by leading to the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of EFHD2 through a cyclooxygenase (COX)-independent mechanism. Combining ibuprofen with cisplatin enhanced antitumor responsiveness in a murine xenograft model in comparison with the individual treatment.

Tablets made from cross-linked hydrophobically modified poly (acrylic acid) (CLHMPAA), commercially available as Pemulen™, have previously shown promising abilities to control the release of hydrophobic model substances. This study further investigates the possibility to use CLHMPAA in tablet formulations using ibuprofen as a model substance. Furthermore, surfactants were added to the dissolution medium in order to simulate the presence of bile salts in the intestine. The release of ibuprofen is strongly affected by the presence of surfactant and/or buffer in the dissolution medium, which affect both the behaviour of CLHMPAA and the swelling of the gel layer that surrounds the disintegrating tablets. Two mechanisms of tablet disintegration were observed under shear, namely conventional dissolution of a soluble tablet matrix and erosion of swollen insoluble gel particles from the tablet. The effects of surfactant in the surrounding medium can be circumvented by addition of surfactant to the tablet. With added surfactant, tablets that may be insusceptible to the differences in bile salt level between fasted or fed states have been produced, thus addressing a central problem in controlled delivery of hydrophobic drugs.

Manganism is caused by neuronal injury in both cortical and subcortical regions, particularly in the basal ganglia. The basis for the selective neurotoxicity of Mn is not yet fully understood. However, several studies suggest that oxidative damage and inflammatory processes play prominent roles in the degeneration of dopamine-containing neurons. In the present study, we assessed the effects of Mn on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, changes in high-energy phosphates and associated neuronal dysfunctions both in vitro and in vivo. Results from our in vitro study showed a significant (p<0.01) increase in biomarkers of oxidative damage, F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-IsoPs), as well as the depletion of ATP in primary rat cortical neurons following exposure to Mn (500 μM) for 2h.

Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on S. pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy). Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication. Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate. In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.",2020,,"Micallef J, Soeiro T, Jonville-Béra AP, French Society of Pharmacology, Therapeutics (SFPT).",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0040595720300925?via%3Dihub,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A new report submitted to the French Medicines Agency in 2024 documented 216 cases of serious bacterial infections (162 with ibuprofen, 54 with ketoprofen) over 4.5 years following the use of NSAIDs for fever or acute pain. This represents about 21% of serious adverse events with ibuprofen (8% with ketoprofen). Streptococcal infections were most common with ibuprofen (62% of serious bacterial infections; 44% with ketoprofen). These streptococcal infections were invasive (97%) and included severe sepsis/toxic shock, pleuropneumopathy, meningitis/meningoencephalitis and necrotizing dermohypodermatitis. Pharmacoepidemiological studies all suggest an association between NSAID exposure and an increased risk of pleuropulmonary complications, with estimated risks ranging from 1.8 to 8. Several mechanistic data also suggest a specific adverse effect on the severity of invasive streptococcal infections through a specific intrinsic effect of NSAIDs on the enhancement of streptococcal diffusion (via vimentin). Experimental studies in animals have also demonstrated this risk, even when NSAIDs are combined with antibiotics. In conclusion, in the presence of a streptococcal infection, whether diagnosed or not, taking an NSAID for fever or acute pain, even for a short time and even in association with an antibiotic, is a risky practice. It encourages the development of a more serious streptococcal infection, not only by delaying management of the infection, but more importantly by promoting the dissemination of the streptococcus. As invasive S. pyogenes infections are a real public health problem, any potential risk factor for aggravation must be taken into account.",2025,,"Jonville-Bera AP, Micallef J.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2025.02.012,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The present study examines the toxicity of (S)-ibuprofen on chondrocytes and synoviocytes isolated from sheep shoulder joint and cultured in monolayers during 72 h, and on joint explants (cartilage and capsule) cultured in mono- or in co-culture for 13 days. (S)-ibuprofen (5 μM up to 1 mM) did not reduce the cell viability and protein content when added on chondrocyte monolayers, while at 1 mM (S)-ibuprofen reduced (by 8%, p=0.01) the synoviocytes viability compared to untreated cells. During co-culture of joint explants, (S)-ibuprofen at 50 μM significantly reduced by 35% the spontaneous release of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from cartilage (p=0.0065) whereas in monoculture, (S)-ibuprofen was inactive on GAG metabolism. (S)-ibuprofen at 1 mM significantly reduced cell lysis (lactate dehydrogenase leakage) by 74% during monoculture of capsule explants (p=0.0136) and by 35% during co-culture of explants (p=0.0013). Our findings demonstrate that the active isomer of ibuprofen at micro- and millimolar levels was not toxic for chondrocytes and synoviocytes and may reduce at 1mM the cell lysis during culture of joint explants.

The exposure of haemocytes to IBU did not affect significantly their viability, but increased the percentage of cells with round shape. IBU caused a significant reduction in both phagocytic activity and lysosomal membrane stability. The percentage of haemocytes positive to TUNEL reaction (indicative of DNA fragmentation) increased significantly after IBU exposure. Significant decreases in the percentage of haemocytes positive to acid phosphatase were recorded at 1000 μg/L of IBU. Conversely, no significant variations were recorded in the percentage of haemocytes positive to phenoloxidase and peroxidase.

We recently identified genes important for acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity in a comprehensive screen and our findings suggested that a small set of yeast strains carrying deletions of ubiquitin-related genes can be informative for drug toxicity profiling. In yeast, approximately 20 different deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have been identified, of which only one is essential for viability. We investigated whether the toxicity profile of DUB deletion yeast strains would be informative about the toxicological mode of action of APAP. A set of DUB deletion strains was tested for sensitivity and resistance to a diverse series of compounds, including APAP, quinine, ibuprofen, rapamycin, cycloheximide, cadmium, peroxide and amino acids and a cluster analysis was performed. Most DUB deletion strains showed an altered growth pattern when exposed to these compounds by being either more sensitive or more resistant than WT. Toxicity profiling of the DUB strains revealed a remarkable overlap between the amino acid tyrosine and acetaminophen (APAP), but not its stereoisomer AMAP. Furthermore, co-exposure of cells to both APAP and tyrosine showed an enhancement of the cellular growth inhibition, suggesting that APAP and tyrosine have a similar mode of action.",2018,,"Huseinovic A, van Dijk M, Vermeulen NPE, van Leeuwen F, Kooter JM, Vos JC.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2017.12.007,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Since then it has been used in several conflicts like the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The use of SM in Syria 2015 indicated the still existing threat. Despite decades of research no causal antidote against SM intoxication is available, so far. A SM intoxication is accompanied by necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation. To counteract the SM-induced inflammation, glucocorticoids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds (NSAIDs) are recommended. Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the anti-inflammatory compounds dexamethasone, ibuprofen and diclofenac in vitro. For that purpose, two different cell culture models were used. Firstly, a monoculture of keratinocytes (HaCaT) and secondly, an established co-culture of keratinocytes (HaCaT) and immunocompetent cells (THP-1) to identify the role of immune cells in the process and to mimic the dermal physiology more closely. Both models were challenged with different SM concentrations (100, 200 and 300μM) and treated with different anti-inflammatory compounds one hour after the SM exposure. Analytical analysis of necrosis (ToxiLight), apoptosis (CDDE) and inflammation (IL-6 and -8 ELISAs) followed 24h thereafter. Dexamethasone provided small but consistent protective effects in the monoculture. For the reduction of apoptosis, 3μM dexamethasone was sufficient. The most effective reduction regarding interleukin (IL) production was found with 6μM dexamethasone. Protective effects were less pronounced in co-culture, which implies, that the protective effects of dexamethasone are rather generic and not due to a modulation of the immune cells. Against our expectations, ibuprofen strongly amplified apoptosis and necrosis in SM exposed cells in the monoculture as well as the co-culture. Therefore, use of ibuprofen for treatment of SM intoxication should at least be considered most critically, if not even regarded as harmful. Diclofenac significantly reduced necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation in the co-culture in a dose-dependent manner. The greatest benefit regarding cell survival and reduction of the inflammation-marker IL-6 after a SM treatment was observed after diclofenac treatment. The protective effects of diclofenac were less pronounced in the monoculture which suggests, that diclofenac can modify the response of immune cells to SM. In conclusion, the results of our experiments, showing a benefit for diclofenac after SM exposure are in line with in vivo data of other researchers. Though, our in vitro results suggest the preferred use of diclofenac over ibuprofen. The benefit of dexamethasone is still equivocal, but low concentrations seem to have some positive effects.",2018,,"Menacher G, Steinritz D, Schmidt A, Popp T, Worek F, Gudermann T, Thiermann H, Balszuweit F.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.09.003,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Treatment of SM-induced adverse health effects, such as cutaneous blistering, ulceration, and inflammation remains a challenging task. Antidotes or specific therapeutic measures are lacking. Some drugs (e.g. cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors) exhibited beneficial effects after SM poisoning in vivo. However, in vitro studies that evaluate and compare the potency of COX inhibitors are missing. In the presented study, non-specific (acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, and piroxicam), COX-2-specific (celecoxib and parecoxib) inhibitors and COX-independent drugs (paracetamol and tofacitinib) were compared regarding anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects after SM exposure in post-exposure treatment settings. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were used as a surrogate model. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) formation, a direct indicator for COX activity, was determined by ELISA. Changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels after SM exposures were assessed by quantitative determination of 27 inflammatory cytokines using a multiplex method. Cytotoxicity was determined using an XTT viability assay. The results demonstrated that SM highly increased PGE<sub>2</sub> production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, predominantly IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. In general, all COX inhibitors and paracetamol were able to reduce the PGE<sub>2</sub> formation, while tofacitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinase, had no influence on PGE<sub>2</sub> levels. In addition, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α formation were also inhibited, but sometimes independently of PGE<sub>2</sub>. The COX-2 specific celecoxib was identified as the most potent drug to reduce IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α formation after SM exposures in vitro.

Our working hypothesis was as follows: could the use of short different amino acid sequence containing d-peptides in adduct detection confer any add-on value to that obtained with GSH? All ""risky"" agents' resulted in the formation of several GSH adducts in the incubation mixture and with at least one peptide adduct with both microsomal preparations. Amlodipine did not form any adducts with any of the trapping agents.

However, many women are unaware of these risks, and commonly report their use in pregnancy. We aimed to determine if umbilical cord was a reliable matrix for detecting NSAID use, determine incidence of use close to labour, and uncover associations with obstetric/neonatal outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a UHPLC-MS/MS method to simultaneously detect diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, and salicylic acid in plasma and umbilical cord lysate. Using this method, we screened 380 lysates to determine the prevalence of NSAID use. Results were compared to the clinical outcomes in pregnancy using ICD9/10 chart codes (n = 21).<h4>Results</h4>The UHPLC-MS/MS method has excellent linearity, accuracy, and precision in solvent and plasma, but lower sensitivity in umbilical cord lysate. We report a 3 % rate of NSAID ingestion within days of labour - the pharmacokinetically-determined window for active ingestion. There were no significant differences observed for maternal, obstetric, or neonatal outcomes between the NSAID positive group (n = 11) and NSAID negative group (n = 369).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Because NSAID use in third trimester is contraindicated, even a 3% usage rate is alarmingly high. Based on UHPLC-MS/MS performance of umbilical cord lysate, 3% is likely a conservative estimate.

A fresh urine solution and a synthetic solution of similar inorganic composition were tested at different pH values in order to investigate their separation behavior. These solutions were spiked with the micropollutants propranolol, ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine. Among the membranes tested, NF270 showed the best performance with respect to the retention of micropollutants. The optimum retention of micropollutants was obtained at values of around pH 5. At this point, the retention of all micropollutants in non-hydrolysed urine was above 92%, while the corresponding value for the synthetic urine solution was above 73%. From the results, it can be concluded that the retention mechanism is determined by steric and electrostatic effects as well as by the partitioning of the micropollutants in the membrane. The nutrients urea and ammonia were well permeated, but phosphate and sulfate were almost completely retained.

The MBR was operated with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h and a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of 8.6-10 g/L. Standard solutions of ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen were dosed into the synthetic feed of the MBR. Influent and permeate samples were then collected for enantiospecific analysis. The individual (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the three pharmaceuticals were derivatised using a chiral derivatizing agent to form pairs of diastereomers, which could then be separated and analysed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Accurate quantitation of individual enantiomers was undertaken by an isotope dilution process. By comparing the total concentration (as the sum of the two enantiomers) in the MBR influent and permeate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen concentrations were observed to have been reduced as much as 99%, 43% and 68%, respectively. Furthermore, evidence of enantioselective biodegradation was observed for all three pharmaceuticals.

This work investigates abiotic degradation pathways of a particular PPCP, ibuprofen, in the presence of a major mineral component of soil (kaolinite clay), as well as the health effects of the primary compound and its degradation products. Results from these studies showed that the rate and extent of ibuprofen degradation is greatly influenced by the presence of clay particles and solar radiation. In the absence of solar radiation, the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface where surface silanol groups play a key role. In contrast, under solar radiation and in the presence of clay particles, ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions. The decay rates were at least 6-fold higher for irradiated samples compared to those of dark conditions. Toxicity of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues were tested on three microorganisms: Bacillus megaterium, Pseudoaltermonas atlantica; and algae from the Chlorella genus.

Selected formulations were incorporated in a hydrogel to assess their in-vivo wound healing efficiency using full-thickness wound model. The vesicles exhibited high EE% (60.6-93.9 %), particle size ranged from 114.8 to 663.5 nm and zeta potential was from -26.2 to -42.3 mV which indicated good stability. In-vitro release pattern was biphasic. In-vivo assessment of wound healing efficacy of selected Ibu-loaded spanlastics disclosed significant reduction of wound size. A significant inhibition in TNF-α secretion as well as increased production of VEGF and Col-1 were noticed in rats treated with topical application of Ibu-spanlastics and an almost normal histological structure was observed in their microphotographs. These results confirmed that spanlastics might be a peculiar delivery system for Ibu to improve its topical wound healing efficacy.",2025,,"Khalil RM, Shalaby ES, Abdelhameed MF, Shabana ME, Wagdi MA.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2025.103796,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It has traditionally necessitated manual sampling and refilling, which requires complex scheduling, and is time-consuming and labour-intensive. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a FDC autosampler, Otto, that could be retrofitted to generic FDCs to automate sampling and refilling. Methylene blue (MB) was used as a model drug to assess the volume consistency and accuracy of the samples. Otto achieved highly consistent sample volumes (coefficient of variation, CV = 3.2 %), surpassing the consistency of manual operation (CV = 7.4 %). The amount of MB measured across multiple sampling-refill cycles mirrored the theoretical amount, as well as the amount determined through manual operation. Otto collected up to 100 samples unattended, over 24 h, in an in vitro ibuprofen permeation study. The samples were collected into standard sample vials to integrate seamlessly with downstream analytical equipment. Otto improved the quality of the permeation data over manual sampling, by sampling automatically around the clock to effectively maintain sink condition in the FDC. It therefore offers a cost-effective, performant and reliable automation solution for permeation studies that use the FDC.",2025,,"Chan HKY, Archbold L, Lau WM, Ng KW.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2025.103837,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although HSCR has clear genetic causes, no HSCR-associated mutation is 100% penetrant, suggesting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions determine HSCR occurrence. To test the hypothesis that certain medicines might alter HSCR risk we treated zebrafish with medications commonly used during early human pregnancy and discovered that ibuprofen caused HSCR-like absence of enteric neurons in distal bowel. Using fetal CF-1 mouse gut slice cultures, we found that ibuprofen treated enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDC) had reduced migration, fewer lamellipodia and lower levels of active RAC1/CDC42. Additionally, inhibiting ROCK, a RHOA effector and known RAC1 antagonist, reversed ibuprofen effects on migrating mouse ENCDC in culture. Ibuprofen also inhibited colonization of Ret+/- mouse bowel by ENCDC in vivo and dramatically reduced bowel colonization by chick ENCDC in culture. Interestingly, ibuprofen did not affect ENCDC migration until after at least three hours of exposure. Furthermore, mice deficient in Ptgs1 (COX 1) and Ptgs2 (COX 2) had normal bowel colonization by ENCDC and normal ENCDC migration in vitro suggesting COX-independent effects. Consistent with selective and strain specific effects on ENCDC, ibuprofen did not affect migration of gut mesenchymal cells, NIH3T3, or WT C57BL/6 ENCDC, and did not affect dorsal root ganglion cell precursor migration in zebrafish. Thus, ibuprofen inhibits ENCDC migration in vitro and bowel colonization by ENCDC in vivo in zebrafish, mouse and chick, but there are cell type and strain specific responses. These data raise concern that ibuprofen may increase Hirschsprung disease risk in some genetically susceptible children.",2016,,"Schill EM, Lake JI, Tusheva OA, Nagy N, Bery SK, Foster L, Avetisyan M, Johnson SL, Stenson WF, Goldstein AM, Heuckeroth RO.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.09.023,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), however, has been inconsistently associated with endometrial cancer risk.<h4>Methods</h4>22,268 female residents of western Washington State, ages 50-76, completed a baseline questionnaire in 2000-2002 and reported on their use of individual NSAIDs over the past 10years. Use was categorized as none, low (<4days/week or <4years), and high (≥4days/week and ≥4years). Over 9years of follow-up, 262 incident invasive endometrial cancers were identified. Multivariable proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Relative to non-use, high use of aspirin was inversely associated with endometrial cancer risk (HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41-1.01; P trend=0.03). Findings were stronger for regular-strength than low-dose aspirin. High use of non-aspirin NSAIDs (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.68-1.95), including ibuprofen (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 0.73-2.28), and naproxen (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.39-2.95) was not associated with risk. In subgroup analyses, findings for aspirin were strongest for cancers of endometrioid histology and were restricted to non-smokers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides additional evidence that use of aspirin, but not non-aspirin NSAIDs, may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, especially in estrogen-mediated cases; however additional prospective studies with high-quality measurement of NSAID use are needed.

Targeting the secretion of sEV PD-L1 has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy. However, the lack of small-molecule inhibitors poses a challenge for clinical translation. In this study, we developed a target and phenotype dual-driven high-throughput screening strategy that combined virtual screening with nanoflow-based experimental verification. We identified ibuprofen (IBP) as a novel inhibitor that effectively targeted sEV PD-L1 secretion. IBP disrupted the biogenesis and secretion of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> sEVs in tumor cells by physically interacting with a critical regulator of sEV biogenesis, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate. Notably, the mechanism of action of IBP is distinct from its commonly known targets, cyclooxygenases. Administration of IBP stimulated antitumor immunity and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma mouse models. To address potential adverse effects, we further developed an IBP gel for topical application, which demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy when combined with anti-PD-1 treatment. The discovery of this specific small inhibitor provides a promising avenue for establishing durable, systemic antitumor immunity.",2024,,"Chen ZK, Zheng S, Long Y, Wang KM, Xiao BL, Li JB, Zhang W, Song H, Chen G.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2024.08.027,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Often only one concentration is available in the literature, hence a general evidence-based theory could allow prediction of how altering the concentration would produce a linear, increased, or decreased relative permeation. Here, we group topical chemicals into groups of how they permeate the skin when we increase or decrease their concentrations per unit area and discuss why we would like to predict their permeability in ranges of studied concentrations.<h4>Purpose</h4>Our research question is: How, if at all, do changes in surface chemical concentration affect percutaneous penetration/absorption in man? Specifically, as the drug concentration is relatively increased, is the rate or extent of absorption proportionally affected? And if so, how?<h4>Methods</h4>We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, the United States Food and Drug Administration, Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, and the European Food Safety Authority for approved transdermal delivery systems from January 1965 to October 2020. Search terms included combinations of the following words: topical + [absorption/penetration] + cm + [human/man].<h4>Results</h4>Of the nineteen chemicals identified, five (testosterone, hydrocortisone, benzoic acid, fluazifop-butyl and lindane) showed decreased percent absorbed with increased dose, one (2-butoxyethanol) showed decreased flux with increased concentration, and thirteen (Basic Brown 17, benzene in gasoline, benzophenone-3, benzoyl peroxide, boric acid, caffeine, climbazole, diclofenac, ethanolamines, ibuprofen, N-octylamine, 2-phenoxyethanol, 2-pyrrolidone) showed increased flux with increasing concentrations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Dermal absorption depends on the interaction between the characteristics of the substance, the vehicle, and the skin. Without experiments investigating these characteristics, we cannot accurately predict the percent absorbed or flux of a formulation without in vitro or in vivo data. More experimental data, especially in vivo, is mandated before a highly efficient prediction model will be reached for validation.",2022,,"Do LHD, Law RM, Maibach HI.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2022.105186,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The effect of ibuprofen on cathepsin D as a marker of lysosomal membrane ""leakiness"" and thromboxane B2 as a marker of platelet activation was evaluated in 44 patients with angina pectoris. Samples of blood analyzed for cathepsin D, thromboxane B2, and lactate were withdrawn from the coronary sinus and brachial artery before and after pacing to 140 beats/min for 4 minutes. Myocardial ischemia was assessed by determination of transmyocardial lactate extraction or production. Ibuprofen (800 mg) or placebo was administered orally 2 hours before cardiac catheterization. Patients were classified into 4 groups on the basis of administration of placebo or ibuprofen and the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia as determined by demonstration of lactate extraction or production after atrial pacing. In patients with lactate extraction, no significant efflux of cathepsin D or thromboxane B2 occurred after pacing. In patients with lactate production given placebo, a 64 +/- 25% increase in the thromboxane B2 level and a 113 +/- 37% increase in cathepsin D activities occurred in the coronary sinus effluent sampled after pacing. In contrast, in patients with comparable coronary artery disease and comparable lactate production who were given ibuprofen, no release of thromboxane B2 (p = 0.05 compared with patients given placebo) or cathepsin D (p less than 0.01 compared with patients given placebo) occurred after pacing-induced ischemia.

It inhibited markedly the enhanced brain cyclooxygenase activity, primarily cyclooxygenase-2, in vivo and dose dependently increased brain cyclooxygenase activity in vitro.

The aim of this study was to identify a xenobiotic that induces hypercholeresis by a similar mechanism.<h4>Methods</h4>Five organic acids (sulindac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, and norfloxacin) were infused into rats with biliary fistulas. Biliary recovery, bile flow, and biliary bicarbonate were analyzed. Sulindac transport was further characterized using Tr(-) rats (deficient in mrp2, a canalicular transporter for organic anions), the isolated perfused rat liver, and hepatocyte membrane fractions.<h4>Results</h4>In biliary fistula rats, sulindac was recovered in bile in unconjugated form and induced hypercholeresis of canalicular origin. Other compounds underwent glucuronidation and were not hypercholeretic. In the isolated liver, sulindac had delayed biliary recovery and induced prolonged choleresis, consistent with a cholehepatic circulation. Sulindac was secreted normally in Tr(-) rats, indicating that its canalicular transport did not require mrp2. In the perfused liver, sulindac inhibited cholyltaurine uptake, and when coinfused with cholyltaurine, induced acute cholestasis. With both basolateral and canalicular membrane fractions, sulindac inhibited cholyltaurine transport competitively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sulindac is secreted into bile in unconjugated form by a canalicular bile acid transporter and is absorbed by cholangiocytes, inducing hypercholeresis. At high flux rates, sulindac competitively inhibits canalicular bile salt transport; such inhibition may contribute to the propensity of sulindac to induce cholestasis in patients.",1999,,"Bolder U, Trang NV, Hagey LR, Schteingart CD, Ton-Nu HT, Cerrè C, Elferink RP, Hofmann AF.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0016-5085(99)70356-2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Study into the role of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids.,"This study was designed to evaluate the effect of an exogenous free radical generating system consisting of purine plus xanthine oxidase on the isolated rat heart and in particular to assess the possible contribution of arachidonic acid or its metabolites to toxicity produced by this drug combination. Purine plus xanthine oxidase produced a time-dependent depression in cardiac contractility which was associated with stimulated release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Electron microscopic analysis revealed a distinct separation of the glycocalyx from the sarcolemmal membrane with no apparent intracellular defects. Purine plus xanthine oxidase was a potent stimulus for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6K-PGF1 alpha) synthesis but leukotriene production was undetectable under any condition. Eicosatetraynoic acid, which totally prevents the metabolism of arachidonic acid, accelerated the loss in force and increased LDH release invoked by purine plus xanthine oxidase, but produced no noticeable change in sarcolemmal ultrastructure. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors produced little influence although pretreatment with either acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen decreased contractility toward the end of purine plus xanthine oxidase perfusion. Nordihydroguarietic acid, a purported inhibitor of 5'-lipoxygenase accelerated the loss in force produced by purine plus xanthine oxidase. The nordihydroguarietic acid effects were associated with reduced 6K-PGF1 alpha efflux but LDH release was unaffected. We also examined whether modification of arachidonic acid release through changes in calcium concentration was associated with altered response to purine plus xanthine oxidase. Lowering the calcium concentration to 0.41 mM (from 1.25 mM control) reduced markedly 6K-PGF1 alpha, efflux as well as LDH release. Although the latter is suggestive of protection, hypocalcemic perfusion resulted in a greater loss in force due to free radical generation. Furthermore, cells from these hearts exhibited a greater degree of glycocalyx separation. Increasing the calcium concentration to 2.50 mM produced no further toxic manifestations in the response to purine plus xanthine oxidase, although the release of 6K-PGF1 alpha was increased. Our results suggest complex toxicity induced by an exogenously generated free radical system. The injury produced by this method is restricted to sarcolemmal changes, the latter being dependent on the external calcium concentration. The study further suggests that accumulation of intracellular unesterified arachidonic acid, which may result from peroxidation of membrane lipids, increases tissue injury caused by exogenous free radicals.",1987,,"Basu DK, Karmazyn M.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-3565(25)39135-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Twelve indomethacin/ibuprofen-like arylalkanoic acid (AAA) anti-inflammatory drugs alone had no effect on [35S]TBPS binding, or on its inhibition by GABA, but potentiated the GABA-antagonistic effects of the four quinolones. Felbinac (4-biphenylacetic acid) was most potent in this respect (EC50 = 110 nM, together with 5 microM norfloxacin), followed by flurbiprofen > anirolac > metiazinic acid > tolmetin = ketoprofen = fenbufen = indomethacin > fenoprofen > ibuprofen = (+)-naproxen = sulindac. Other anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs, including aspirin, diclofenac, diflunisal, meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid, nambumetone, phenacetin, piroxicam, and phenylbutazone, failed to potentiate the GABA-antagonistic effect of norfloxacin. Felbinac (1 microM) increased the GABA-antagonistic potencies of norfloxacin and enoxacin about 26-fold, while increasing those of ciprofloxacin and pipemidic acid 7-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively. Using subsaturating concentrations of the four quinolones, concentration-response curves for felbinac yielded EC50 values ranging from 110 nM with 5 microM norfloxacin to 1.3 microM with 100 microM pipemidic acid. Three other piperazinoquinolone antibacterial agents (amifloxacin, difloxacin, and fleroxacin) and four nonpiperazinoquinolone anti-bacterial agents (oxolinic acid, cinoxacin, nalidixic acid, and piromidic acid) were much weaker GABA antagonists and were not significantly potentiated by felbinac.

Our results suggest that norfloxacin and related piperazinoquinolones, acting at GABAA receptors, may induce a high affinity binding site for indomethacin/ibuprofen-like anti-inflammatory agents (the AAA site) that, when occupied, reciprocally increases the affinities of the quinolones for GABAA receptors.

UVB exposure initially induces an inflammatory response characterized by edema, dermal infiltration of leukocytes, sunburn cell formation, as well as the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression and subsequent increase in the production and release of prostaglandins. This process of inflammation induced by UVB exposure has been linked to tumor formation. Recently, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib, was developed, which inhibits COX-2-induced inflammation without inhibiting the cytoprotective function of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). The present study compared the effects of topical treatment with Celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor) and Ibuprofen (a nonspecific COX inhibitor) on the acute UVB-induced cutaneous inflammatory response. We show that the specific inhibition of COX-2 effectively reduced many parameters of UVB-mediated inflammation, including edema, dermal neutrophil infiltration and activation, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels and the formation of sunburn cells. By inhibiting this inflammatory response, topical Celecoxib treatment may ultimately be effective in preventing UVB-induced tumor development in the skin.",2000,,"Wilgus TA, Ross MS, Parrett ML, Oberyszyn TM.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0090-6980(00)00089-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

As the factors which regulate the release of choriomammotrophin remain to be elucidated, we investigated the potential involvement of phospholipase C-induced phospholipid metabolism in the release of this placental hormone. Phospholipase C (PLC) caused a dose-dependent release of choriomammotrophin from ovine placenta, incubated in vitro. At a concentration of 0.2 units/ml (0.25 microgram protein/ml), PLC caused the release of choriomammotrophin from placental tissue to approximately double that observed in control incubations (7.08 +/- 0.4 micrograms/50 mg/h and 3.26 +/- 0.3 micrograms/50 mg/h, respectively). PLC treatment did not significantly alter plasma membrane permeability, as indicated by the release of lactate dehydrogenase and protein. PLC-stimulated release of oCM was completely abolished by incubation in calcium-free medium or by preincubation with the inorganic calcium-channel blocking agents cobalt chloride (4 mM) and lanthanum chloride (1 mM). The effects of PLC treatment on ovine choriomammotrophin (oCM) release were also inhibited by preincubation of placental tissue with inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism: ibuprofen (10(-5) M), naproxen (10(-4) M) or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) 5 X 10(-6) M).

These novel dual drug systems provided significantly enhanced in vitro penetration rates through a model lipophilic barrier membrane compared to conventional individual formulations of each active. Thus, for ibuprofen, drug penetration flux enhancements of three- and 10-fold were observed when compared to an aqueous ibuprofen suspension and a commercial alcohol-based ibuprofen formulation, respectively. Methyl nicotinate penetration rates were shown to be similar for aqueous gels and emulsified systems. Mechanisms explaining these observations are proposed.

A range of ibu:terpene binary mixtures were melted together, cooled, and recrystallised. Composition/melting point phase diagrams were determined by DSC and FT-IR analysis was used to investigated the nature of the interaction. Permeation of ibu across human epidermal membrane from the eutectic system was measured and compared to the flux from a saturated aqueous solution across skin and skin pretreated with the terpenes. The eutectic, i.e. minimum, melting points of these systems ranged from 32 degrees C for ibu:thymol 40:60 (% w/w) to -13 degrees C for ibu:1,8-cineole 40:60 (% w/w) compared to 76 degrees C for ibu alone. FT-IR studies indicated that only the terpenes which formed hydrogen bonds with ibu produced eutectic systems. Each set of ibu:terpene eutectic systems produced a significant (t-test, p = 0.05) increase in flux compared to a saturated aqueous solution applied to untreated and to terpene pretreated skin. For example, ibu:thymol 40:60 (% w/w) produced a flux of 150 micrograms/cm2/h, 5.9 times the flux from a saturated aqueous solution with thymol pretreated skin and 12.7 times the flux from a saturated aqueous solution across non-pretreated skin.

Cellulose additives significantly prolonged ibuprofen release, whereas additives were found to have a slight release-increasing effect on lidocaine as compared with the PO gel. The structural differences of the gels, more than the macroviscosity, seem to regulate the release of drugs. The drug permeation-prolonging effect of the respective gels, along with the control solutions, was evaluated in vitro using porcine dura mater membrane. The compact gel depot acted as the rate-limiting step, and significantly prolonged the dural permeation of both drugs in comparison with control solutions.

Paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) were determined using von Frey filaments. Ligated rats developed tactile allodynia within 24h, as evidenced by a decrease in PWT in the affected hindpaw (<4 g vs. >15 g control). Sham-operated controls were unchanged from baseline (>15 g). Allodynia was also characterized by a significant increase in the evoked release of PGE(2). Thus, brushing the plantar surface of the affected hindpaw with a cotton-tipped applicator, 5 days postligation, increased the [PGE(2)](dialysate) to 199+/-34% of the prestimulus control period. In contrast, brushing had no detectable effect on release before surgery or in sham-operated animals. Basal release (no brushing) was similar before and after surgery (sham-operated and ligated rats). In a separate group of rats and beginning 2 days after ligation, the acute i.t. injection of S(+)-ibuprofen, SC-51322, SC-236, or SC-560 significantly reversed allodynia (maximum effect=69+/-9, 66+/-6, 57+/-4, 20+/-5%, respectively).

Chilled aqueous solutions of xyloglucan that had been partially degraded by beta-galactosidase formed gels at concentrations of 1-2% w/w when warmed to 37 degrees C. The in vitro release of ibuprofen and ketoprofen at pH 7.4 from the enzyme degraded xyloglucan gels and the subsequent permeation of these fully ionized drugs through cellulose membranes followed root-time kinetics over a period of 12 h after an initial lag period. Diffusion coefficients were appreciably higher when the drugs were released from 1.5% w/w xyloglucan gels than when released from 25% w/w Pluronic F127 gels formed in situ under identical conditions. The difference in release rates was attributed to differences in the structure of the gels. The permeation rate of ibuprofen through excised skin was higher than that of ketoprofen when released from both gels, but of similar magnitude through cellulose membranes.

We believe this is the first time that simultaneous permeation across skin of a solute and its vehicle has been determined purposefully. The data successfully demonstrated that simultaneous permeation of NSAIDs and essential fatty acids, EPA and DHA from a formulation containing fish oil is feasible. In addition, for both NSAIDs, the relative rates of permeation of EPA and DHA, were in proportion to their levels in the fish oil and the permeation rate of either fatty acid was higher when the permeation rate of the solute was greater. This suggested that the greater the rate of permeation of the NSAID, the greater the rate of permeation of the vehicle, and that a solute permeates skin complete with its vehicular solvation cage.

This observation prompted study of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) accumulations and products of cyclooxygenase. Experiments were conducted with a skin abrasion preparation. Five groups of six rabbits were pretreated intravenously with: (1) placebo, (2) ibuprofen, (3) imidazole and two other Tx syntase inhibitors, (4) OKY 1555, or (5) OKY 046. Zymosan-activated serum (ZAS) and leukotriene B4 were used as chemotaxins and balanced salt solution as control. After pretreatment with placebo, PMN accumulation in leukotriene B4 sites was 2130 +/- 874 PMN/mm3 (mean +/- SD). Pretreatment with ibuprofen, imidazole, or OKY 046 decreased (p less than 0.05) accumulations to 205 +/- 139 PMN/mm3, 485 +/- 387 PMN/mm3, and 504 +/- 260 PMN/mm3, respectively. In ZAS sites, placebo pretreatment led to 2006 +/- 866 PMN/mm3, while the ibuprofen, imidazole, and OKY 046 groups had decreased (p less than 0.05) responses of 295 +/- 218 PMN/mm3, 444 +/- 477 PMN/mm3, and 386 +/- 151 PMN/mm3, respectively. Pretreatment with OKY 1555 did not produce significant reductions in response. Six animals in each group received intradermal injections of the two chemotaxins or Hank's balanced salt solution. Reduction in PMN accumulations after cyclooxygenase and Tx inhibition were similar to those observed in the skin abrasion preparation. Pretreatment with either ibuprofen, imidazole, or OKY 046 resulted in a decreased concentration of Tx in abrasion fluid exudate in response to leukotriene B4, 275 +/- 164 pg/ml, 460 +/- 144 pg/ml, and 440 +/- 260 pg/ml, respectively, as compared with 1168 +/- 380 pg/ml in the placebo group. The reduced responses were not the result of a decrease in regional perfusion as measured by 133Xe washout. The in vitro chemotactic response of PMN to leukotriene B4 and ZAS was unchanged after incubation in either ibuprofen, imidazole, OKY 1555, or OKY 046.

With the aim of improving the availability of sodium ibuprofen (IBU) at the intraocular level, IBU-loaded polymeric nanoparticle suspensions were made from inert polymer resins (Eudragit RS100). The nanosuspensions were prepared by a modification of the quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion technique using variable formulation parameters (drug-to-polymer ratio, total drug and polymer amount, stirring speed). Nanosuspensions had mean sizes around 100 nm and a positive charge (zeta-potential of +40/+60 mV), this makes them suitable for ophthalmic applications. Stability tests (up to 24 months storage at 4 degrees C or at room temperature) or freeze-drying were carried out to optimize a suitable pharmaceutical preparation. In vitro dissolution tests indicated a controlled release profile of IBU from nanoparticles. In vivo efficacy was assessed on the rabbit eye after induction of an ocular trauma (paracentesis). An inhibition of the miotic response to the surgical trauma was achieved, comparable to a control aqueous eye-drop formulation, even though a lower concentration of free drug in the conjunctival sac was reached from the nanoparticle system. Drug levels in the aqueous humour were also higher after application of the nanosuspensions; moreover, IBU-loaded nanosuspensions did not show toxicity on ocular tissues.",2002,,"Pignatello R, Bucolo C, Ferrara P, Maltese A, Puleo A, Puglisi G.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0928-0987(02)00057-x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Our research focused on physico-chemical characterization of ternary systems containing ibuprofen lysinate, lecithin and water. The influence of the resulting microstructures on drug release and permeation through excised human stratum corneum was also investigated. Depending on the mixing ratio different physical states (lamellar and hexagonal liquid crystals, micellar solutions, liposomal dispersions and biphasic systems) were determined by gross, polarizing microscopic and small angle-X-ray analysis. A special emphasis was laid upon the storage-induced transformation of liposomal dispersions into mixed micellar solutions and its influence on drug release and permeation. A model for the transformation process is presented. Drug release of the liposomal dispersion (Da=1.1x10-5 cm2/s) and of the identically composed mixed micellar solution (Da=2.9x10-5 cm2/s) was delayed compared with the data of the aqueous drug solution (Da=4.7x10-5 cm2/s). Because of the association of ibuprofen lysinate molecules with phospholipid molecules within the liposomal and the mixed micellar system the share of free ibuprofen lysinate monomers, which can pass through the dialysis membrane in the release experiment, is markedly reduced. The results of permeation experiments of these systems, however, did not correspond to the release data. The permeability of the mixed micellar solution rose after 6 weeks of storage (P=4.2x10-8 cm/s), and almost reached the permeation of the aqueous solution (P=3.9x10-8 cm/s), whereas the permeation of the liposomal dispersion was very slow (P=1.5x10-8 cm/s). The different colloidal microstructures of the formulations obviously resulted in divergent interactions with the permeation barrier - the stratum corneum - and subsequently in different permeation behavior.",1998,,"Stoye I, Schröder K, Müller-Goymann CC.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0939-6411(98)00023-x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In these organotypic cultures the dermal cells are incorporated into a contracted collagen gel, the epidermal cells are seeded on top of this gel and form a multilayered stratified epidermis when cultivated at the air-liquid interface. For permeation studies two different donor systems containing ibuprofen acid were used, Ibutop-Creme and Dolgit-Mikrogel. Studies using excised human stratum corneum showed differences in drug permeability for these two formulations which were also observed when the native organotypic cultures were used. In general, organotypic cultures show a higher permeability for topically applied drugs than excised human stratum corneum, the cultures consisting of transformed cells showed an increase in drug permeability for the Dolgit-Mikrogel compared with the native cultures which might be due to a higher sensitivity for the enhancer isopropanol in this formulation.",1998,,"Specht C, Stoye I, Müller-Goymann CC.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0939-6411(98)00028-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A specific group of NSAIDs (indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, acemetacin, zomepirac and mefenamic acid) all at non-toxic levels, significantly increased the cytotoxicity of the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin), as well as teniposide, VP-16 and vincristine, but not the other vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vinorelbine. A substantial number of other anticancer drugs, including methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, hydroxyurea, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitoxantrone, actinomycin D, bleomycin, paclitaxel and camptothecin, were also tested, but displayed no synergy in combination with the NSAIDs. The synergistic effect was concentration dependent. The effect appears to be independent of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory ability of the NSAIDs, as (i) the synergistic combination could not be reversed by the addition of prostaglandins D2 or E2; (ii) sulindac sulphone, a metabolite of sulindac that does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, was positive in the combination assay: and (iii) many NSAIDs known to be cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, e.g. meclofenamic acid, diclofenac, naproxen, fenoprofen, phenylbutazone, flufenamic acid, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and ketoprofen, were inactive in the combination assay. The enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed in a range of drug sensitive tumour cell lines, but did not occur in P-170-overexpressing multidrug resistant cell lines. However, in the HL60/ADR and COR L23R cell lines, in which multidrug resistance is due to overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP, a significant increase in cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of the active NSAIDs. Subsequent Western blot analysis of the drug sensitive parental cell lines, DLKP and A549, revealed that they also expressed MRP and reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that mRNA for MRP was present in both cell lines. It was found that the positive NSAIDs were among the more potent inhibitors of [3H]-LTC4 transport into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles prepared from MRP-expressing cells, of doxorubicin efflux from preloaded cells and of glutathione-S-transferase activity. The NSAIDs did not enhance cellular sensitivity to radiation.

A rapid absorption of orally administered CS is observed in rats and in humans when the drug is dissolved in water. Lower and delayed absorption is observed when CS is administered in gastroresistant capsules. The absolute bio-availability is 15 and 12% for rats and humans respectively. The CS shows a tropism for cartilagineous tissues in rats and for knee tissues in humans as demonstrated by scintigraphic analysis with 99mTc-CS. Monomers, oligo and polysaccharides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of CS appear in the blood and tissues together with native CS. The effects of partially depolymerized (m.m. 3 to 15 kD) and desulfated fractions on human leukocytes were investigated. CS and its fractions inhibit the directional chemotaxis induced by zymosan-activated serum, are able to decrease the phagocytosis and the release of lysozyme induced by zymosan and to protect the plasma membrane from oxygen reactive species. In rats the oral administration of CS significantly decreases granuloma formation due to sponge implants and cell migration and lysosomal enzyme release in carrageenan pleurisy. Compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen), CS appears to be more effective on cellular events of inflammation than on edema formation. It is noteworthy that CS is devoid of dangerous effects on the stomach, platelets and kidneys. In synovial fluid of patients requiring joint aspiration, treated orally for 10 days with CS (800 mg/day) the hyaluronate concentration and the intrinsic viscosity significantly increased, while collagenolytic activity, phospholipase A2 and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) decreased.

Calcium efflux was estimated with arsenazo III as an indicator and the redox state of NAD(P)H was monitored fluorimetrically at the 366/450 nm excitation/emission wavelength pair. Dipyrone, paracetamol and ibuprofen did not induce calcium efflux even at 1 mM, piroxicam and salicylate were poor inducers, while diclofenac sodium and mefenamic acid were potent inducers releasing calcium even at 20 microM and 10 microM, respectively. In the presence of 10 microM calcium, CsA had no appreciable effect while in the presence of 30 microM calcium it delayed calcium efflux. Oxidation of mitochondrial NAD(P)H, concomitant with calcium efflux and inhibited by CsA, was observed only in the presence of 30 microM calcium. The results suggest that diclofenac sodium and mefenamic acid induce calcium efflux in mitochondria through both a mechanism intrinsic to the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and a mechanism including the electroneutral Ca2+/nH+ porter.",1998,,"Pigoso AA, Uyemura SA, Santos AC, Rodrigues T, Mingatto FE, Curti C.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s1357-2725(98)00030-2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This new approach facilitates mass transport into the microdialysis probe by inclusion of a complexation agent in the microdialysis perfusion fluid.

Only the polycarbonate/polyether membrane was able to give an E(d) greater than 100%. In general, a maximum increase in E(d) was found when 0.5 w/v% β-CD was included in the perfusion fluid. Variations in the ibuprofen concentration external to the microdialysis probe did not significantly change E(d) when 0.5 w/v% β-CD was included in the perfusion fluid. In contrast to the ibuprofen data, β-CD inclusion in the microdialysis perfusion fluid did not affect antipyrine E(d). Antipyrine does not form known inclusion complexes with β-CD.

The current study used an in vitro primary fish gill cell culture system to assess the effect of pH values in the range of 4.5-8.75 on the uptake rates of the base propranolol (pKa 9.42) and the acid ibuprofen (pKa 4.59). The rate-limiting step in the uptake was the diffusive supply flux of the unionized form from the water to the apical membrane, with subsequent rapid transfer across the epithelium. Computed uptake rate based on the unionized fraction best described the uptake of propranolol and ibuprofen over the range of pH values 5-8 and 6-8.75, respectively. For ibuprofen, the computed uptake rate overestimated the uptake below pH 6 where the unionized fraction increased from 4% at pH 6 to 55% at pH 4.5. As the unionized fraction increased, the uptake rate plateaued suggesting a saturation of the transport process. For both drugs, large variations in the uptake occur with only small fluctuations in pH values.

We grew P. australis in perlite under greenhouse conditions and treated plants with 60 μg/L of IBP. Roots and rhizomes (RR), stems and leaves (SL), and liquid samples were collected during 21 days of exposure. Results show that P. australis can take up, translocate, and degrade IBP. IBP was completely removed from the liquid medium after 21 days with a half-life of 2.1 days. IBP accumulated in RR and was partly translocated to SL. Meanwhile, four intermediates were detected in the plant tissues: hydroxy-IBP, 1,2-dihydroxy-IBP, carboxy-IBP and glucopyranosyloxy-hydroxy-IBP. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was involved in the production of the two hydroxy intermediates. We hypothesize that transformation of IBP was first catalyzed by P450, and then by glycosyltransferase, followed by further storage or metabolism in vacuoles or cell walls. No significant phytotoxicity was observed based on relative growth of plants and stress enzyme activities.

The majority of pharmaceuticals are ionizable, and freshwaters can have a range of pH values that affect speciation. In this study, we assessed the uptake of 10 pharmaceuticals (acetazolamide, beclomethasone, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, norethindrone, propranolol, and warfarin) with differing modes of action and physicochemical properties (p K<sub>a</sub>, log S, log D, log K<sub>ow</sub>, molecular weight (MW), and polar surface area (PSA)) by an in vitro primary fish gill cell culture system (FIGCS) for 24 h in artificial freshwater. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) regression was used to determine the molecular descriptors that influence the uptake rates. Ionizable drugs were taken up by FIGCS; a strong positive correlation was observed between log S and the uptake rate, and a negative correlation was observed between p K<sub>a</sub>, log D, and MW and the uptake rate. This approach shows that models can be derived on the basis of the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals and the use of an in vitro gill system to predict the uptake of other compounds.

Binding of these drugs destabilizes the protein, suggesting that this may be the mechanism of inhibition, as reported for the anticancer drug toremifene and the painkiller ibuprofen, which bind in the same large cavity on the glycoprotein. Crystal structures show that the position of binding and the mode of interaction within the pocket vary significantly between these compounds. The binding constants (K<sub>d</sub>) determined by thermal shift assay correlate with the protein-inhibitor interactions as well as with the antiviral activities determined by virus cell entry assays, supporting the hypothesis that these drugs inhibit viral entry by binding the glycoprotein and destabilizing the prefusion conformation.

The structure of LLC matrices is complementary to cell membranes and provides an efficient, controlled, and selective release of drugs. In this work, a complex of experimental methods was used to characterize binary LLCs Pluronic P123/DMSO and triple LLC systems Pluronic P123/DMSO/Ibuprofen, which are interesting as transdermal drug delivery systems. Liquid crystalline, thermal, and rheological properties of LLCs were studied. Concentration and temperature areas of the lyomesophase existence were found, and phase transition enthalpies were evaluated. Intermolecular interactions among the components were studied by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. In vitro studies of Ibuprofen (Ibu) release from various LLCs allow differentiation of its release depending on the polymer content. Atomic force microscopy and contact angle methods were used to characterize the surface morphology of the hydrophobic membrane, which was used as a stratum corneum model, and also evaluate the adhesion work of the LLCs.

Artemisinin, a gift from traditional Chinese medicine, has been used in the treatment of malaria and has shown good therapeutic efficiency. However, due to its low solubility, poor bioavailability, and short half-life time, some smart delivery strategies are still required. Herein, a multifunctional DES prepared from ibuprofen and menthol was prepared. This DES was shown to efficiently promote the solubility of artemisinin up to 400-fold. Then, it was further applied as the oil phase to construct an O/W microemulsion with the help of Tween-80 + Span-20 mixed surfactants. The prepared microemulsion displayed high efficiency in improving the permeability of artemisinin, which can be ascribed to the presence of the permeation enhancer menthol in DES and the microstructure of the O/W microemulsion.

Cell-free tools used to predict membrane interactions should replicate the molecular organization of the membrane. Microcavity array-supported lipid bilayer (MSLB) platforms are versatile biophysical models of the cell membrane that combine liposome-like membrane fluidity with stability and addressability. We used an MSLB herein to interrogate drug-membrane interactions across seven drugs from different classes, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories: ibuprofen (Ibu) and diclofenac (Dic); antibiotics: rifampicin (Rif), levofloxacin (Levo), and pefloxacin (Pef); and bisphosphonates: alendronate (Ale) and clodronate (Clo). Fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (FLCS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to evaluate the impact of drug on 1,2-dioleyl- sn-glycerophosphocholine and binary bilayers over physiologically relevant drug concentrations. Although FLCS data revealed Ibu, Levo, Pef, Ale, and Clo had no impact on lipid lateral mobility, EIS, which is more sensitive to membrane structural change, indicated modest but significant decreases to membrane resistivity consistent with adsorption but weak penetration of drugs at the membrane. Ale and Clo, evaluated at pH 5.25, did not impact the impedance of the membrane except at concentrations exceeding 4 mM. Conversely, Dic and Rif dramatically altered bilayer fluidity, suggesting their translocation through the bilayer, and EIS data showed that resistivity of the membrane decreased substantially with increasing drug concentration. Capacitance changes to the bilayer in most cases were insignificant. Using a Langmuir-Freundlich model to fit the EIS data, we propose R<sub>sat</sub> as an empirical value that reflects permeation. Overall, the data indicate that Ibu, Levo, and Pef adsorb at the interface of the lipid membrane but Dic and Rif interact strongly, permeating the membrane core modifying the water/ion permeability of the bilayer structure.

Current dissolution methodologies may not always be suitable for such compounds due to excessive fluid volume, high fluid shear rates, heterogeneity of shear rates, suboptimal fluid flow, and, ultimately, the lack of absorption ability (Gray The Science of USP 1 and 2 Dissolution: Present Challenges and Future Relevance; <i>Pharmaceutical Research</i>, 2009; Vol. 26; pp 1289-1302). Herein, a new dissolution apparatus is introduced in combination with an ultrathin, semipermeable polymer membrane that mimics human passive absorption for lipophilic compounds. The ultrathin large-area polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane (UTLAM) absorption system is designed to mimic the dissolution and passive transcellular diffusion process representing the oral absorption pathway. A simple spin-casting method was developed to fabricate the ultrathin highly uniform membranes. To minimize membrane resistance to diffusion and maximize transport across the polymer membrane, 10-40 μm PDMS membranes were successfully prepared. A new diffusion cell was designed and tested to support the UTLAM and incorporates a hydrofoil impeller for more desirable hydrodynamics and mixing, using ibuprofen as a model weak acidic drug. UTLAM permeability was sufficiently high that the aqueous boundary layer contributed to the overall permeability of the system. This diffusion cell system demonstrated that, when the aqueous diffusion layer contributes to the overall resistance to transport, the pH at which absorption is 50% of maximum (pH<sub>50%</sub>) shifts from the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> to higher values, demonstrating why weak acid drugs can exhibit high absorption at pH's significantly greater than their p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>.

Of these advantages, long-acting drug delivery is perhaps the most valuable. Hydrophilic compounds are particularly difficult to deliver for prolonged times. This work investigates the use of poly(caprolactone) (PCL)-based implant coatings as a novel strategy to prolong the delivery of hydrophilic compounds from implantable devices that have been prepared by additive manufacturing (AM). Hollow implants were prepared from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) using fused filament fabrication (FFF) AM and subsequently coated in a PCL-based coating. Coatings were prepared by solution-casting mixtures of differing molecular weights of PCL and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Increasing the proportion of low-molecular-weight PCL up to 60% in the formulations decreased the crystallinity by over 20%, melting temperature by over 4 °C, and water contact angle by over 40°, resulting in an increased degradation rate when compared to pure high-molecular-weight PCL. Addition of 30% PEG to the formulation increased the porosity of the formulation by over 50% when compared to an equivalent PCL-only formulation. These implants demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> release rates for hydrophilic model compounds (methylene blue and ibuprofen sodium) ranging from 0.01 to 34.09 mg/day, depending on the drug used. The versatility of the devices produced in this work and the range of release rates achievable show great potential.

We thoroughly investigate global and local molecular dynamics, thermal properties, and physical stability of the IBU+acMAL binary systems by using broadband dielectric spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry as well as test their water solubility and dissolution rate. The obtained results are extensively discussed by analyzing several factors considered to affect the physical stability of amorphous systems, including those related to the global mobility, such as plasticization/antiplasticization effects, the activation energy, fragility parameter, and the number of dynamically correlated molecules as well as specific intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonds, supporting the latter by density functional theory calculations.

Before being absorbed through epithelial cell membranes to reach the systemic circulation, drugs must first dissolve in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. <i>In vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> dissolutions are complex because of their dependency upon the drug physicochemical properties, drug product, and GI physiological properties. However, an understanding of this process is critical for the development of robust drug products. To enhance our understanding of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> dissolutions, a hierarchical mass transfer (HMT) model was developed that considers the drug properties, GI fluid properties, and fluid hydrodynamics. The key drug properties include intrinsic solubility, acid/base character, p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>, particle size, and particle polydispersity. The GI fluid properties include bulk pH, buffer species concentration, fluid shear rate, and fluid convection. To corroborate the model, <i>in vitro</i> dissolution experiments were conducted in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) 2 dissolution apparatus. A weakly acidic (ibuprofen), a weakly basic (haloperidol), and a nonionizable (felodipine) drug were used to study the effects of the acid/base character, p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>, and intrinsic solubility on dissolution. 900 mL of 5 mM bicarbonate and phosphate buffers at pH 6.5 and 37 °C was used to study the impact of the buffer species on drug dissolution. To investigate the impacts of fluid shear rate and convection, the apparatus was operated at different impeller rotational speeds. Moreover, presieved ibuprofen particles with different average diameters were used to investigate the effect of particle size on drug dissolution. <i>In vitro</i> experiments demonstrate that the dissolution rates of both the ionizable compounds used in this study were slower in bicarbonate buffer than in phosphate buffer, with the same buffer concentration, because of the lower interfacial buffer capacity, a unique behavior of bicarbonate buffer. Therefore, using surrogates (i.e., 50 mM phosphate) for bicarbonate buffer for biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> dissolution testing may overestimate the <i>in vivo</i> dissolution rate for ionizable drugs. Model simulations demonstrated that, assuming a monodisperse particle size when modeling, dissolution may overestimate the dissolution rate for polydisperse particle size distributions. The hydrodynamic parameters (maximum shear rate and fluid velocity) under <i>in vitro</i> conditions in the USP 2 apparatus under different rotational speeds are orders of magnitude higher compared to the <i>in vivo</i> situation. The inconsistencies between the <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> drug dissolution hydrodynamic conditions may cause an overestimation of the dissolution rate under <i>in vitro</i> conditions. The <i>in vitro</i> dissolution data supported the accuracy of the HMT for drug dissolution.

The incorporation of additives, such as surfactants, during microneedle fabrication might be an alternative solution to overcome the limited range of materials used in fabricating dissolving MAPs. However, there is a lacuna in the knowledge on the effect of surfactants on the manufacture and performance of dissolving MAPs. The current study explores the role of surfactants in the manufacture and performance of dissolving MAPs fabricated from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) loaded with the model drugs, ibuprofen sodium and itraconazole. Three nonionic surfactants, Lutrol F108, Pluronic F88, and Tween 80, in solutions at varying concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% w/w) were loaded into these dissolving MAPs. It was discovered that all of the dissolving MAPs that incorporated surfactant displayed a lower reduction in the microneedle height (≈10%) relative to the control formulation (≈20%) when subjected to a compressive force of 32 N. In addition, the incorporation of surfactants in some instances enhanced the insertion profile of these polymeric MAPs when evaluated using <i>ex vivo</i> neonatal porcine skin. The incorporation of surfactant into ibuprofen sodium-loaded dissolving MAPs improved the insertion depth of MAPs from 400 μm down to 600 μm. However, such enhancement was not apparent when the MAPs were loaded with the model hydrophobic drug, itraconazole. Skin deposition studies highlighted that the incorporation of surfactant enhanced the delivery efficiency of both model drugs, ibuprofen sodium and itraconazole. The incorporation of surfactant enhanced the amount of ibuprofen sodium delivered from 60.61% up to ≈75% with a majority of the drug being delivered across the skin and into the receptor compartment. On the other hand, when surfactants were added into MAPs loaded with the model hydrophobic drug itraconazole, we observed enhancement in intradermal delivery efficiency from 20% up to 30%, although this did not improve the delivery of the drug across the skin.

It is critical to understand how particle size and dose affect the behavior of dissolving particles in the presence of a CBL adjacent to a semipermeable surface both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Control of particle size is ubiquitous in the pharmaceutical industry; however, traditional pharmaceutical assumptions of particle dissolution typically ignore particle dissolution within the length scale of the CBL. The CBL does not physically prevent particles from traveling to the semipermeable surface (mucus, epithelial barrier, synthetic membrane, etc.), and particle dissolution can occur within the CBL thickness (δ<sub>C</sub>) if the particle is sufficiently small (∼<i>d</i><sub>particle</sub> ≤ δ<sub>C</sub>). The total flux (the time rate transport of molecules across the membrane surface per unit area) was chosen as a surrogate parameter for measuring the additional mass generated by particles dissolving within the donor CBL. Mass transfer experiments aimed to measure the total flux of drug using an ultrathin large-area membrane diffusion cell described by Sinko et al. with a silicone-based membrane ( <i>Mol.

Experimentally measured total flux across the semipermeable membrane/CBL region agreed with the predictions from the proposed model, and at a range of relatively low suspension concentrations, dependent on the average particle size, there was a measurable effect on the flux due to the difference in δ<sub>C</sub> that formed at the membrane surface. Additionally, the dose-dependent total flux across the membrane was up to 10% higher than the flux predicted by the standard Higuchi-Hiestand dissolution model where the effects of confinement were ignored as described by Wang et al.

Comparative Study for the Xanthine Derivatives to Recognize Their Intermolecular Interactions Using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectra, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray Powder Diffractometry (XRPD).","Molecular interactions between active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and xanthine (XAT) derivatives were analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD). XAT derivatives were mixed with equimolar amounts of ibuprofen (IBP) and diclofenac (DCF), and their dissolution behaviors were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The solubility of IBP decreased in mixtures with caffeine (CFN) and theophylline (TPH), whereas that of DCF increased in mixtures with CFN and TPH. No significant differences were observed between the mixtures of theobromine (TBR) or XAT with IBP and DCF. Mixtures with various molar ratios were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to further explore these interactions. The results were subjected to SVD. This analysis provides valuable insights into the differences in interaction strength and predicted interaction sites between XAT derivatives and APIs based on the combinations that form mixtures. The results also showed the impact of the XAT derivatives on the dissolution behavior of IBP and DCF. Although IBP and DCF were found to form intermolecular interactions with CFN and TPH, these effects resulted in a reduction of the solubility of IBP and an increase in the solubility of DCF.

The study highlights how the chemical structure of the cation significantly influences surface activity, lipophilicity, and solubility in aqueous media. Furthermore, the new ionic forms of APIs, the synthesis of which was assessed with <i>Green Chemistry</i> metrics, exhibited very good antibacterial properties against common pathogens that contribute to the development of acne, resulting in remarkable enhancement of biological activity ranging from 200 to as much as 2000 times when compared to salicylic acid alone.

The polar/electrostatic interaction forces between analytes and membrane phospholipids (Δlog kW(IAM)) were calculated as the differences between the experimental values of log kW(IAM) and those expected for isolipophilic neutral compounds having polar surface area (PSA) = 0. The values of passage through a porcine brain lipid extract (PBLE) artificial membrane for 36 out of the 42 compounds considered, measured by the so-called PAMPA-BBB technique, were taken from the literature (P0(PAMPA-BBB)). The values of blood-brain barrier (BBB) passage measured in situ, P0(in situ), for 38 out of the 42 compounds considered, taken from the literature, represented the permeability of the neutral forms on ""efflux minimized"" rodent models. The present work was aimed at verifying the soundness of Δlog kW(IAM) at describing the potential of passage through the BBB as compared to data achieved by the PAMPA-BBB technique. In a first instance, the values of log P0(PAMPA-BBB) (32 data points) were found significantly related to the n-octanol lipophilicity values of the neutral forms (log P(N)) (r(2) = 0.782) whereas no significant relationship (r(2) = 0.246) was found with lipophilicity values of the mixtures of ionized and neutral forms existing at the experimental pH 7.4 (log D(7.4)) as well as with either log kW(IAM) or Δlog kW(IAM) values. log P0(PAMPA-BBB) related moderately to log P0(in situ) values (r(2) = 0.604). The latter did not relate with either n-octanol lipophilicity indexes (log P(N) and log D(7.4)) or phospholipid affinity indexes (log kW(IAM)). In contrast, significant inverse linear relationships were observed between log P0(in situ) (38 data points) and Δlog kW(IAM) values for all the compounds but ibuprofen and chlorpromazine, which behaved as moderate outliers (r(2) = 0.656 and r(2) = 0.757 for values achieved on IAM.PC.MG and IAM.PC.DD2, respectively). Since log P0(in situ) refer to the ""intrinsic permeability"" of the analytes regardless their ionization degree, no correction for ionization of Δlog kW(IAM) values was needed. Furthermore, log P0(in situ) were found roughly linearly related to log BB values (i.e., the logarithm of the ratio brain concentration/blood concentration measured in vivo) for all the analytes but those predominantly present at the experimental pH 7.4 as anions. These results suggest that, at least for the data set considered, Δlog kW(IAM) parameters are more effective than log P0(PAMPA-BBB) at predicting log P0(in situ) values for all the analytes. Furthermore, ionization appears to affect differently, and much more markedly, BBB passage of acids (yielding anions) than that of the other ionizable compounds.",2016,,"Grumetto L, Russo G, Barbato F.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00397,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The study aim was to investigate the role of secondary cytotoxic effect in a macrophage-lung cancer coculture model after nanoparticle treatment in the presence and absence of anti-inflammatory drugs. An in vitro coculture model composed of confluent alveolar macrophage MH-S and A-549 lung cancer cells separated by a 0.4 μm porous membrane was used in the study. Macrophages were treated with two sizes of gelatin nanoparticles and two sizes of poly(isobutyl cyanoacrylate) (PIBCA) nanoparticles, with and without doxorubicin as a chemotherapeutic drug. The treatment effect with and without the presence of anti-inflammatory drug was studied using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The model drugs were ibuprofen, celecoxib, prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methotrexate. Different nanoparticles in different sizes were synthesized with a range of physicochemical characteristics. Doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles were prepared with an entrapment efficiency of 82-83% for PIBCA and 39-42% for gelatin. Nanoparticle treatment of macrophages showed a secondary cytotoxic effect on A-549 cancer cells at 24 and 36 h, with a drop in cell viability of 40-62%. However, this effect was significantly reduced to 10-48% if the macrophages were exposed to anti-inflammatory drugs. When ibuprofen and celecoxib were used the cell viability rebounded between 24 and 36 h. For prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methotrexate the cell viability dropped further between 24 and 36 h. Macrophages exposed to nanoparticles show secondary cytotoxicity, which has a significant antitumor effect in the microclimate of the coculture model. The beneficial nanoparticle treatment effect was significantly reduced if nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, or methotrexate was given at the same time.

The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the in vivo drug dissolution and systemic absorption of the BCS class IIa drug ibuprofen under fed and fasted conditions by direct sampling of stomach and small intestinal luminal content. Expanding current knowledge of drug dissolution in vivo will help to establish physiologically relevant in vitro models predictive of drug dissolution. A multilumen GI catheter was orally inserted into the GI tract of healthy human subjects. Subjects received a single oral dose of ibuprofen (800 mg tablet) with 250 mL of water under fasting and fed conditions. The GI catheter facilitated collection of GI fluid from the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. Ibuprofen concentration in GI fluid supernatant and plasma was determined by LC-MS/MS. A total of 23 subjects completed the study, with 11 subjects returning for an additional study visit (a total of 34 completed study visits). The subjects were primarily white (61%) and male (65%) with an average age of 30 years. The subjects had a median [min, max] weight of 79 [52, 123] kg and body mass index of 25.7 [19.4, 37.7] kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Ibuprofen plasma levels were higher under fasted conditions and remained detectable for 28 h under both conditions. The AUC<sub>0-24</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were lower in fed subjects vs fasted subjects, and T<sub>max</sub> was delayed in fed subjects vs fasted subjects. Ibuprofen was detected immediately after ingestion in the stomach under fasting and fed conditions until 7 h after dosing. Higher levels of ibuprofen were detected in the small intestine soon after dosing in fasted subjects compared to fed. In contrast to plasma drug concentration, overall gastric concentrations remained higher under fed conditions due to increased gastric pH vs fasting condition. The gastric pH increased to near neutrality after feedingbefore decreasing to acidic levels after 7 h. Induction of the fed state reduced systemic levels but increased gastric levels of ibuprofen, which suggest that slow gastric emptying and transit dominate the effect for plasma drug concentration. The finding of high levels of ibuprofen in stomach and small intestine 7 h post dosing was unexpected.

PDMS is biomimetic because of similarities in small molecule transport, such as mechanism, ionization selectivity, lipophilicity. Nine molecular probes are used to evaluate the transport pathways and properties used to predict human oral absorption rates. The transport pathways through PDMS (bulk/pore) are analogous to transcellular (TCDT) and paracellular (PCDT) drug transport pathways. PDMS PCDT is assessed using positronium annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and partition experiments; TCDT using diffusion and partition experiments. PALS determined that PDMS pores were uniform (D ∼ 0.85 nm), isolated, and void volume was unaffected by drug accumulation after equilibrium partitioning. Therefore, there is no PCDT or convective flow through PDMS. A strong linear correlation exists between predicted octanol-water partition coefficients and PDMS partition coefficients (LogK<sub>PDMS</sub> = 0.736 × LogP<sub>O-W</sub> - 0.971, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.981). The pH-partition hypothesis is confirmed in PDMS using ibuprofen over pH 2-12.

Although NSAIDs are known to impact multiple cellular signaling mechanisms, a recent finding is that the NSAID salicylate can disrupt histone acetylation, in part through direct inhibition of the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300/CBP. While salicylate is a relatively weak KAT inhibitor, its CoA-linked metabolite is more potent; however, the ability of NSAID metabolites to inhibit KAT enzymes biochemically and in cells remains relatively unexplored. Here we define the role of metabolic and nonmetabolic mechanisms in inhibition of KAT activity by NSAID chemotypes. First, we screen a small panel of NSAIDs for biochemical inhibition of the prototypical KAT p300, leading to the finding that many carboxylate-containing NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, are able to function as weak inhibitors. Assessing the inhibition of p300 by ibuprofen-CoA, a known NSAID metabolite, reveals that linkage of ibuprofen to CoA increases its biochemical potency toward p300 and other KAT enzymes. In cellular studies, we find that carboxylate-containing NSAIDs inhibit histone acetylation. Finally, we exploit the stereoselective metabolism of ibuprofen to assess the role of its acyl-CoA metabolite in regulation of histone acetylation. This unique strategy reveals that formation of ibuprofen-CoA and histone acetylation are poorly correlated, suggesting metabolism may not be required for ibuprofen to inhibit histone acetylation. Overall, these studies provide new insights into the ability of NSAIDs to alter histone acetylation, and illustrate how selective metabolism may be leveraged as a tool to explore the influence of metabolic acyl-CoAs on cellular enzyme activity.",2018,,"Shrimp JH, Garlick JM, Tezil T, Sorum AW, Worth AJ, Blair IA, Verdin E, Snyder NW, Meier JL.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00943,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In a previous study, we determined the solution and total concentrations of ibuprofen as a function of time in aspirated GI fluids, after oral administration of an 800 mg IR tablet (reference standard) of ibuprofen to 20 healthy volunteers in fasted state conditions. In addition, we determined luminal pH and motility pressure recordings that were simultaneously monitored along the GI tract. Blood samples were taken to determine ibuprofen plasma levels. In this work, an in-depth statistical and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to explain which underlying GI variables are determining the systemic concentrations of ibuprofen between (inter-) and within (intra-) subjects. In addition, the obtained plasma profiles were deconvoluted to link the fraction absorbed with the fraction dissolved. Multiple linear regressions were performed to explain and quantitatively express the impact of underlying GI physiology on systemic exposure of the drug (in terms of plasma C<sub>max</sub>/AUC and plasma T<sub>max</sub>). The exploratory analysis of the correlation between plasma C<sub>max</sub>/AUC and the time to the first phase III contractions postdose (TMMC-III) explains ∼40% of the variability in plasma C<sub>max</sub> for all fasted state subjects. We have experimentally shown that the in vivo intestinal dissolution of ibuprofen is dependent upon physiological variables like, in this case, pH and postdose phase III contractions. For the first time, this work presents a thorough statistical analysis explaining how the GI behavior of an ionized drug can explain the systemic exposure of the drug based on the individual profiles of participating subjects. This creates a scientifically based and rational framework that emphasizes the importance of including pH and motility in a predictive in vivo dissolution methodology to forecast the in vivo performance of a drug product.

Many in vivo techniques are available to investigate the impact of GI physiology on oral drug behavior in fasting state conditions. However, little is known about the intraluminal behavior of a drug in postprandial conditions. In a previous report, we described the mean solution and total concentrations of ibuprofen after oral administration of an immediate-release (IR) tablet in fed state conditions. In parallel, blood samples were taken to assess systemic concentrations. The purpose of this work was to statistically evaluate the impact of GI physiology (e.g., pH, contractile events) within and between individuals (intra and intersubject variability) for a total of 17 healthy subjects. In addition, a pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed by noncompartmental analysis, and PK parameters were correlated with underlying physiological factors (pH, time to phase III contractions postdose) and study parameters (e.g., ingested amount of calories, coadministered water). Moreover, individual plasma profiles were deconvoluted to assess the fraction absorbed as a function of time, demonstrating the link between intraluminal and systemic behavior of the drug. The results demonstrated that the in vivo dissolution of ibuprofen depends on the present gastric pH and motility events at the time of administration. Both intraluminal factors were responsible for explaining 63% of plasma C<sub>max</sub> variability among all individuals.

However, these physical barriers could not prevent adhesion formation completely. Because a high-intensity inflammation occurs in the surgical area, the presence of relevant drugs to control such an inflammation is desperately needed. In this study, we fabricated an electrospun composite ibuprofen-loaded poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous membrane (NFM) to prevent abdominal adhesions. This membrane aimed to act as a barrier between the abdominal wall and surrounding tissues, without interrupting mass transfer and normal wound healing. Among various fabricated composite NFMs, PCL/25PEG-6% NFMs showed the lowest fiber diameter (448.8 ± 124.4 nm), the smallest pore size (<2 μm), and moderate ultimate stress and strain. The PCL/25PEG-6% NFMs had the lowest water contact angle (≈75°) and the highest drug profile release (≈80%) within 14 days. Furthermore, <i>in vitro</i> toxicity examination of PCL/25PEG-6% toward fibroblast cells demonstrated a cell viability of ≈82% after 3 days, proving its prolonged antiadhesion ability. In addition, the low number of adherent cells with a rounded shape and low cell proliferation on these NFMs indicated their special antiadhesive effects. Collectively, these results indicated that the PCL/25PEG-6% membrane might be a suitable barrier to prevent abdominal adhesion.",2022,,"Kheilnezhad B, Hadjizadeh A, Hadjizadeh A.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsabm.2c00126,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this work, we developed a pore-expanded version of MIL-101(Cr), MIL-101(Cr)-P, and assessed its potential as a carrier for ibuprofen and 5-fluorouracil drugs along with its regular MIL-101(Cr) analogue. The pore expansion strategy gave rise to a higher surface area and mesopore volume for MIL-101(Cr)-P relative to regular MIL-101(Cr). The characterization results revealed successful incorporation of 30, 50, and 80 wt % of both drugs within the MOF structure. Upon incorporation of species, the surface area and porosity of the two MOF carriers decreased drastically; however, the drug-loaded MOFs still retained some degree of porosity, even at high drug loadings. For both drugs, the delivery experiments conducted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) showed that MIL-101(Cr)-P possessed better pharmacokinetic behavior than MIL-101(Cr) by delivering higher amounts of drug at all three loadings and exhibiting much faster release rates. Such behavior was originated from large mesopores that were created during pore expansion, providing diffusional pathways for efficient delivery of the drugs. The highest rate constant obtained by fitting the release kinetics to the Higuchi model was found to be 0.44 h<sup>-1/2</sup> for the release of 30 wt % 5-fluorouracil from MIL-101(Cr)-P.

Therefore, multifunctional wound dressings that can modulate these factors to promote wound healing are in high demand. In this work, a multifunctional Janus electrospinning nanofiber dressing with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, controlled release of drugs, and unidirectional water transport was prepared by depositing coaxial nanofibers on a hydrophilic poly(ε-caprolactone)@polydopamine-ε-polyl-lysine (PCL@PDA-ε-PL) nanofiber membrane. The coaxial nanofiber was loaded with the phase change material lauric acid (LA) in the shell layer and anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (IBU) in the core layer. Among them, LA with a melting point of 43 °C served as a phase change material to control the release of IBU. The phase transition of LA was induced by near-infrared (NIR) irradiation that triggered the photothermal properties of PDA. Moreover, the Janus nanofiber dressing exhibited synergistic antimicrobial properties for <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> due to the photothermal properties of PDA and antibacterial ε-PL. The prepared Janus nanofiber dressing also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity and biocompatibility. In addition, the Janus nanofiber dressing had asymmetric wettability that enabled directional water transport, thereby draining excessive wound exudate. The water vapor transmission test indicated that the Janus nanofiber dressing had good air permeability.

The Solution Blow Spinning (SBS) technique has attracted the attention of researchers due to the production of nanofiber mats in a continuous process, which exhibit high porosity and the ability to deliver drugs locally. The objective of this work was to produce and encapsulate ibuprofen in mats of PCL/PEG as a fast-acting analgesic drug delivery system. Initially, beaded nanofiber structures were produced from PCL solutions in chloroform at 8% (w/v) and PCL/PEG solutions in mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1. The influence of the PEG concentration, gas pressure (compressed air), and solution injection rate on the fibers' morphology was analyzed by SEM. Then, the best condition for the formation of PCL/PEG beaded fiber structure was selected (1:1, 137.90 kPa, and 7.2 mL/h) for the fabrication of the mat containing ibuprofen at proportions of 5, 15, and 30% by polymer mass (PCL/PEG). The SBS-spun mats demonstrated a remarkable swelling capacity of approximately 400%, with bead presence enabling a gradual release of ibuprofen within the first 5 h.

Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) represents a frequently utilized chemotherapeutic agent for liver cancer patients. Sodium bicarbonate (SB) serves to neutralize the acidic tumor microenvironment, while ibuprofen (IBU) attenuates inflammatory factor production. The combination of these three commonly used drugs facilitates antitumor efficacy and relapse prevention. Composite fibrous membranes were prepared by incorporating the antitumor drug DOX into MSN, which was then codispersed with IBU in a poly l-lactic acid (PLLA) electrospinning solution after acid sensitization using SB. The resulting membrane was characterized using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The toxic effect of this fibrous membrane and its pro-apoptotic effect on tumor cells were evaluated, along with the expression of cell proliferation-related factors, immune/inflammatory factors, and apoptosis-related factors. Immunohistochemistry and HE staining confirmed its ability to inhibit recurrence of postoperative residual cancer without causing toxicity to vital organs. The PLLA-MSN@DOX-SB-IBU nanofibrous membrane not only mitigates the cardiotoxicity associated with DOX but also inhibits tumor cell proliferation and enhances the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating significant antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, it effectively prevents the recurrence of residual cancer postsurgery while exhibiting excellent biocompatibility.

However, the permeation of drug molecules across the skin is difficult due to the presence of highly ordered lipid barrier. This study details the development of a novel TD system, which has the potential to simultaneously enhance the skin permeability and adhesion behavior. Ibuprofen (IP) was selected as model drug. The ability of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) and hydrophobic titanium nanotube (TNT) to enhance the skin permeability was explored. Additionally, β-cyclodextrin (βCD), which can exceptionally encapsulate poorly water-soluble drugs, is grafted with methacrylates to improve the skin adhesion property. Finally, Au-TNT nanocomposite was deposited onto methacrylate-grafted βCD matrix. The developed material was characterized through NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The characteristics of the film, including water vapor permeability (WVP), thermomechanical properties, etc., were examined in terms of Au-TNT content. The TD delivery of IP with different concentrations of Au-TNT was evaluated via an in vitro skin permeation study through rat skin. It is revealed that the prepared TD film exhibited an improved drug-delivery performance due to the synergistic action of AuNP and hydrophobic TNT. The cumulative percent of IP delivered across the skin is extremely depending on nanofiller content, lipophilicity, and thickness of the membrane, and the device incorporated with 4.0% Au-TNT displayed the best performance. In addition, a study on storage stability was performed by storing the films for 2 months at different temperatures. The study revealed that the device possessed excellent storage stability when stored at low temperature. The developed film offers excellent WVP, drug encapsulation efficiency, thermomechanical properties, and skin adhesion behavior. Moreover, the device was cosmetically attractive, noncytotoxic, and resistant to microbial growth and hence extremely reliable for skin application.

The resulting flexible membrane consists of microscaled, multilayered cellulose acetate (CA) membranes loaded with IBU in the shape of either concentric squares or circles, as the top and bottom layers of a sandwich structure. In between the CA-IBU layers are randomly electrospun polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) layers loaded with GLP. The complete fibrous membrane sandwich can be folded and embedded into a 0-size capsule to achieve oral compliance. Simulated in vitro testing of gastric and intestinal fluids demonstrated a triphasic release profile. There was an immediate release of GLP after gastric juices dissolved the capsule shell and the PVP, followed by the short-term release of 60% of the IBU within an hour afterward, and the remaining IBU was released in a sustained manner following a Fickian diffusion profile.

It is an emergency condition and challenging to treat due to the poor vascularity of affected body parts, and it requires immediate action. In addition to cold trauma-induced tissue damage, the inflammatory mediators majorly contribute to pathologic aggravations. We have designed and evaluated a topical ""nano-spray gel (NSG)"" formulation, which is based on a combination of liposomal heparin sodium (Hp) and ibuprofen (Ibu) for rapid relief of frostbite injury in extremely low temperatures. The scientific literature suggests that heparin is associated with rapid endothelial cell repair, normalizing blood circulation in capillaries, and has a potential role in wound healing. Hp-containing liposomes were prepared by the extruder method, which suitably formulated an ibuprofen-containing gel to obtain a nano-Spray formulation (HLp-Ibu-NSG) applicable for topical delivery. A single spray puff of the formulation delivers ∼154 mg of the gel, which corresponds to ∼205 U of heparin. In this study, heparin liposomes exhibited significant healing of wound in vitro (scratch assay, fibroblast cells) and in vivo (wound healing in Sprague Dawley rats) at a low dose. In the rat model of frostbite injury, the HLp-Ibu-NSG formulation demonstrated significant reduction in the wound area (up to ∼96%) and improvement of histopathology in 14 days as compared to the control groups. No edema and erythema were detected post-treatment of HLp-Ibu-NSG in the affected area. The underlying mechanism was delineated as a modulation of the inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-4) mediators at the wound site and blood circulation to foster frostbite healing. Future clinical studies on the nano-spray gel are required to evaluate its efficacy for the treatment of frostbite symptoms.

In the brain, however, the transporter-mediated drug delivery has not yet been fully achieved due to the complexity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Because L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a good candidate to improve the brain delivery, we developed here four novel LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of four nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. As a result, all the prodrugs were able to cross the BBB and localize into the brain cells. The brain uptake of salicylic acid (SA) was improved five times, not only across the mouse BBB but also into the cultured mouse and human brain cells. The naproxen prodrug was also transported efficiently into the mouse brain achieving less peripheral exposure, but the brain release of naproxen from the prodrug was not improved. Contrarily, the high plasma protein binding of the flurbiprofen prodrug and the premature bioconversion of the ibuprofen prodrug in the mouse blood hindered the efficient brain delivery. Thus, the structure of the parent drug affects the successful brain delivery of the LAT1-utilizing prodrugs, and the small-sized LAT1-utilizing prodrug of SA constituted a successful model to specifically deliver its parent drug across the mouse BBB and into the cultured mouse and human brain cells.",2020,,"Montaser AB, Järvinen J, Löffler S, Huttunen J, Auriola S, Lehtonen M, Jalkanen A, Huttunen KM.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00564,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The CZPPrgo has the best performance with maximum adsorption capacities of 148 and 146 mg·g<sup>-1</sup> for removing IBP and DCF from water, respectively. The experimental data were fitted into different kinetic and isotherm models; the removal of IBP and DCF follows the pseudo-second order, which can be best explained by the Freundlich isotherm model. The reuse efficiency was above 80% even after four adsorption cycles. This shows that the CZPPrgo is a promising adsorbent for removing IBP and DCF in water.",2023,,"Bayode AA, Folorunso MT, Helmreich B, Omorogie MO.",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c07769,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Deep-learning-based drug repurposing can contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic applications for drugs with other indications. The current study used a trained deep-learning model to screen an FDA-approved drug library for novel COX-2 inhibitors. Reference COX-2 data sets, composed of active and decoy compounds, were obtained from the DUD-E database. To extract molecular features, compounds were subjected to RDKit, a cheminformatic toolkit. GraphConvMol, a graph convolutional network model from DeepChem, was applied to obtain a predictive model from the DUD-E data sets. Then, the COX-2 inhibitory potential of the FDA-approved drugs was predicted using the trained deep-learning model. Vismodegib, an anticancer agent that inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway by binding to smoothened, was predicted to inhibit COX-2. Noticeably, some compounds that exhibit high potential from the prediction were known to be COX-2 inhibitors, indicating the prediction model's liability. To confirm the COX-2 inhibition activity of vismodegib, molecular docking was carried out with the reference compounds of the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and ibuprofen. Furthermore, the experimental examination of COX-2 inhibition was also carried out using a cell culture study. Results showed that vismodegib exhibited a highly comparable COX-2 inhibitory activity compared to celecoxib and ibuprofen. In conclusion, the deep-learning model can efficiently improve the virtual screening of drugs, and vismodegib can be used as a novel COX-2 inhibitor.",2023,,"Yasir M, Park J, Han ET, Park WS, Han JH, Kwon YS, Lee HJ, Chun W.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c05425,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Because of its source, it is characterized by a high carbon content, and so it has been considered a worthwhile substrate for the synthesis of carbon dots (CDs). Therefore, waste biomass with high availability in Central Europe was selected as substrates for CDs synthesis: apple pomace, rapeseed pomace, and potato peelings. These materials are characterized by varying the composition and nitrogen content. The synthesis of CDs by thermolysis was investigated. The obtained CDs were examined by UV-vis spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The CDs synthesis yield (SY) and fluorescence quantum yield (QY) were determined. This paper proves that CDs can be synthesized efficiently by thermal degradation in a solvent-free process using plant waste biomass. Despite the varying compositions of the substrates, CDs with similar emission characteristics were achieved. CDs obtained from apple pomace and potato peelings have a crystalline structure and size of 4-5 nm, while CDs obtained from rapeseed pomace have an amorphous structure and size of 11 nm. CDs derived at 260 °C from potato peelings are characterized by the strongest fluorescence among synthesized materials, a QY of 14.5%, with 12.3% SY. The potential of the obtained CDs as an optical biosensor was investigated against a variety of metal ions and water pollutants. The CDs obtained from potato peelings can be effectively used in the detection of Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions (linearity range 12.5-1250 μM) and ibuprofen (linearity range 0.25-5 mM).",2025,,"Matyjasik W, Matus K, Długosz O, Pulit-Prociak J, Banach M.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c10119,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In particular, pharmaceuticals have caused great concern because after their consumption, traces of metabolites are excreted and reach the water resources either directly or after inefficient treatment. Despite this, these compounds are not regulated in drinking water, and existing toxicity data are inadequate to assess potential risks from chronic low-dose exposure. Considering the necessity to find new efficient, reusable, and biocompatible systems to remove organic pollutants from wastewater, the adsorption process has been found to be the most effective and economical because it is simple, highly efficient, regenerative, and scalable and does not produce intermediates that can increase the toxicity of the parent contaminants. Prompted by these reasons, in this research, an adsorbed medium composed of graphene oxide and an amine-oxazoline-based polymer (poly-(2-(3-(amino)-propyl))-2-oxazoline) was synthesized and employed in several adsorption experiments targeting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (<b>1</b>), aspirin (<b>2</b>), ketoprofen (<b>3</b>), and benzoic acid (<b>4</b>). The specific interaction between acidic moieties of drugs and basic domains of the polymer has been investigated by targeting both acid compounds and pharmaceutical products free of carboxylic groups. Also, the influence of several parameters, including initial concentration, liquid-phase composition, pH, and reusability, has been investigated. Results show that the maximum adsorption capacity for ibuprofen (<b>1</b>), aspirin (<b>2</b>), ketoprofen (<b>3</b>), and benzoic acid (<b>4</b>) for experiments conducted in water, at the maximum initial concentration explored (90 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and at natural pH equilibrium (pH ∼ 4), are, respectively, 37.4, 27.5, 43.5, and 26.0 mg g<sup>-1</sup>. These findings suggest that the prepared GO-pAmOx material has significant potential for adsorbing these drugs in water and good versatility for all investigated acid compounds and maintains high reusability.

Despite the recent reports, integrated information related to the measurements and effects of NSAIDs on Brazilian water ecosystems is still limited, given the importance of Brazilian aquatic biodiversity. Thus, to fill these gaps, after a close literature search using scientific databases, this review aims to summarize the main scientific efforts concerning the occurrence of NSAIDs in Brazilian aquatic environments, the multiple physiological effects on native species, and the different protocols used in the research laboratories. Accordingly to the current literature data (2013-2023), a total of 32 studies were found describing the occurrence of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen in Brazilian waters, with concentration ranging from 2.5 to 785,280 ng L<sup>-1</sup>, with the majority of the studies performed in Sao Paulo state (<i>n</i> = 10) showing the heterogeneity of monitoring across Brazilian territory. Regarding the adverse effects on native aquatic species, a total of 3 species, including <i>Rhamdia quelen</i>, <i>Astyanax lacustris</i>, and <i>Hoplias malabaricus</i>, have been used to investigate the NSAIDs' adverse effects. The investigations reported endocrine disruption effects by diclofenac and ibuprofen, isolated and combined, in teleosts, oxidative stress responses, and immunotoxicity effects after NSAIDs exposure. When considering the ecotoxicological risk assessment of NSAIDs to Brazilian water bodies, the data showed a low risk quotient (RQ) for the native models across Brazilian territory. However, due to the lack of investigations using representative biological models and robust data concerning the adverse biological impacts of NSAIDs, the RQ may be underestimated, and future directions on NSAIDs investigations are suggested using an integrative approach between environmental safety standards and human health at different environmental risk evaluations.",2025,,"Godoi FGA, Dias MA, Montagner CC, Lo Nostro FL, Moreira RG.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.5c01916,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-101-(Cr) material was synthesized hydrothermally and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm its structure and surface functionality. To construct the solid-phase extraction (SPE) tip, only 5 mg of MOF was immobilized within a 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter, enabling rapid and solvent-efficient sample pretreatment. Coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), the method achieved a detection limit of 0.038 μg/L and a recovery rate of 96.84% at pH 3. The extraction performance was strongly influenced by solution pH, with ζ-potential analysis revealing electrostatic attraction as the primary mechanism for naproxen adsorption under acidic conditions.

However, mounting evidence suggests that their pharmacology extends beyond this canonical pathway. In this study, the potential of NSAIDs to modulate human acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme linking neuroinflammation, metabolic dysfunction and degenerative diseases, was evaluated. An integrative strategy combining silicon and vitro approaches was employed. Structure-based molecular docking using GOLD, molecular dynamics simulations with AMBER21, and MM-GBSA free energy calculations were performed to assess binding stability and energetic favorability. Among the compounds that were tested, nimesulide displayed the highest binding affinity (Δ<i>G</i> = -24.2 kcal/mol), followed by dipyrone (-16.0 kcal/mol), ibuprofen (-11.0 kcal/mol), and paracetamol (-9.0 kcal/mol). The per-residue energy decomposition revealed the involvement of aromatic and polar residues in the catalytic gorge, displaying interaction patterns analogous to those of classical AChE inhibitors. Experimental enzymatic assays corroborated these predictions, demonstrating a dose-dependent inhibition of AChE activity by nimesulide at micromolar concentrations. These findings suggest that NSAIDs, particularly nimesulide, may act as dual modulators with both anti-inflammatory and cholinergic regulatory effects.

The system is similar to a related gelator system we had studied previously, but we were unable to apply the same gelling procedure because of the instability of the colloid caused by the small structural modification (length of the alkyl chain in the bis-imidazolium head group). This situation holds true for the gels formed with varying compositions and under different conditions (gelator/drug ratio, solvent proportion, and flow rates), with the most significant differences being the improved gel rheology and slower drug release rates. Very importantly, the gels (based on a previously unexplored system) have a higher water content ratio (water/EtOH 4:1) than others in the family, making their medicinal application more attractive. The gels were characterized by a variety of microscopy techniques, X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, and rheology. Salts of the antiinflammatory drugs ibuprofen and indomethacin were successfully incorporated into the gels. The diffraction experiments indicate that these composite gels with relatively short alkyl chains in the gelator component contrast to previous systems, in that they exhibit structural order and the presence of crystalline areas of the drug molecule implying partial phase separation (even though these drug crystallites are not discernible by microscopy). Furthermore, the release study with the gel incorporating ibuprofenate showed promising results that indicate a possible drug delivery vehicle application for this and related systems.",2017,,"Sathyanarayanan G, Rodrigues M, Limón D, Rodriguez-Trujillo R, Puigmartí-Luis J, Pérez-García L, Amabilino DB.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.7b01800,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this work, a combined experimental and computational investigation of the main structural and physicochemical parameters driving drug adsorption/desorption kinetics was carried out. Two model drugs (aspirin and ibuprofen) and three water-stable, biocompatible MOFs (MIL-100(Fe), UiO-66(Zr), and MIL-127(Fe)) have been selected to obtain a variety of drug-matrix couples with different structural and physicochemical characteristics. This study evidenced that the drug-loading and drug-delivery processes are mainly governed by structural parameters (accessibility of the framework and drug volume) as well as the MOF/drug hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. As a result, the delivery of the drug under simulated cutaneous conditions (aqueous media at 37 °C) demonstrated that these systems fulfill the requirements to be used as topical drug-delivery systems, such as released payload between 1 and 7 days.

Both pristine and functionalized Zr-DASDCAs, together with activated carbon, were used as a potential carrier for ibuprofen (IBU) storage and delivery. Zr-DASDCAs, especially the modified ones (OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA), showed competitive results in IBU delivery. Specifically, the release rate in phosphate-buffered saline solution at pH 7.4 was nearly constant (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.98) for up to 10 days, which would be very effective in IBU dosing to the human body. Moreover, the release rate could be controlled by changing the pH of the releasing solution. The rate of IBU release from both pristine and modified Zr-DASDCAs at pH 7.4 and 3.0 was also explained with a few interactions such as H-bonding and electrostatic repulsion, together with the relative pore size of the Zr-DASDCAs. Therefore, the results suggested that functionalization of MOFs via postsynthetic modification, especially with OC and TC, to introduce various functional groups onto MOFs is an effective approach to not only reducing the release rate of IBU but also inducing a constant release of IBU for as long as 10 days.",2019,,"Sarker M, Shin S, Jhung SH.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b01139,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Here, we studied two types of Fe-MOFs: MIL-53 and MIL-88B, for in vitro drug loading and releasing of ibuprofen as a model drug. Both Fe-MOFs are based on the same iron clusters and organic ligands but form different crystal structures as a result of two different nucleation pathways. The MIL-53 structure demonstrates one-dimensional channels, while MIL-88B exhibits a three-dimensional cage structure. Our studies show that MIL-53 adsorbs more ibuprofen (37.0 wt %) compared to MIL-88B (19.5 wt %). A controlled drug release was observed in both materials with a slower elution pattern in the case of the ibuprofen-encapsulated MIL-88B. This indicates that a complex cage structure of MIL-88 is beneficial to control the rate of drug release. A linear correlation was found between cumulative drug release and the degree of material degradation, suggesting the biodegradation of Fe-MILs as the main drug elution mechanism. The cytotoxicity of MIL-88B was evaluated in vitro with NIH-3T3 Swiss mouse fibroblasts, and it shows that MIL-88B has no adverse effects on cell viability up to 0.1 mg/mL. This low toxicity was attributed to the morphology of MIL-88B nanocrystals.

(-)-Oleocanthal is a monophenolic secoiridoid exclusively occurring in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). While several groups have investigated oleocanthal pharmacokinetics (PK) and disposition, none was able to detect oleocanthal in biological fluids or identify its PK profile that is essential for translational research studies. Besides, oleocanthal could not be detected following its addition to any fluid containing amino acids or proteins such as plasma or culture media, which could be attributed to its unique structure with two highly reactive aldehyde groups. Here, we demonstrate that oleocanthal spontaneously reacts with amino acids, with high preferential reactivity to glycine compared to other amino acids or proteins, affording two products: an unusual glycine derivative with a tetrahydropyridinium skeleton that is named oleoglycine, and our collective data supported the plausible formation of tyrosol acetate as the second product. Extensive studies were performed to validate and confirm oleocanthal reactivity, which were followed by PK disposition studies in mice, as well as cell culture transport studies to determine the ability of the formed derivatives to cross physiological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier. To the best of our knowledge, we are showing for the first time that (-)-oleocanthal is biochemically transformed to novel products in amino acids/glycine-containing fluids, which were successfully monitored <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, creating a completely new perspective to understand the well-documented bioactivities of oleocanthal in humans.",2021,,"Darakjian LI, Rigakou A, Brannen A, Qusa MH, Tasiakou N, Diamantakos P, Reed MN, Panizzi P, Boersma MD, Melliou E, El Sayed KA, Magiatis P, Kaddoumi A.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00166,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The enzymes are remarkable in that they catalyze two dioxygenations and two cyclizations of the native substrate, arachidonic acid, with near absolute regio- and stereoselectivity. Several theories have been advanced to explain the nature of enzymatic control over this series of reactions, including suggestions of steric shielding and oxygen channeling. As proposed here, selective radical trapping and spin localization in the substrate-derived pentadienyl radical intermediate can also be envisioned. Herein we describe the results of explicit, 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations of both COX-1 and COX-2 with the substrate-derived pentadienyl radical intermediate bound in the active site. The enzymes' influence on the conformation of the pentadienyl radical was investigated, along with the accessible space above and below the radical plane and the width of several channels to the active site that could function as access routes for molecular oxygen. Additional simulations demonstrated the extent of molecular oxygen mobility within the active site. The results suggest that spin localization is unlikely to play a role in enzymatic control of this reaction. Instead, a combination of oxygen channeling, steric shielding, and selective radical trapping appears to be responsible.

MED,15926557,15926557,10.1021/es048590e,In vitro assessment of modes of toxic action of pharmaceuticals in aquatic life.,"An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific, specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems. Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems exceptforthe photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a 100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with photosynthesis through photosystem II inhibition. Mixture experiments were performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron.

In a continuously operated process, the nutrients were concentrated up to a factor of 3.2. The concentration factor was limited by water transport across the membrane. Water transport was caused by osmosis and electroosmosis, and a model was developed to describe these phenomena. The removal of several spiked micropollutants was investigated in continuous electrodialysis experiments. Ethinylestradiol was removed completely during the whole operating period. Diclofenac and carbamazepine were initially retained, but limited permeation (5-10%) occurred after longer operating times (90 days). Retentions of propranolol and ibuprofen were also high initially, but substantial breakthroughs occurred during extended operation. Considerable adsorption on the membranes was observed for all compounds. The permeation mechanism of several compounds appears to depend on the adsorbed amount on the membrane, which indicates that partitioning and diffusion mechanisms play an important role in the permeation transport. Partial desorption occurred in leaching experiments with polarity reversal, and almost quantitative desorption was observed after incubation of the membranes with Filter Count Gel Solution. Because environmental concentrations are much lower than the concentrations spiked here, it can be anticipated that operation without significant permeation is possible in practice during extended periods of time.",2006,,"Pronk W, Biebow M, Boller M.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es051921i,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Neither of these conditions reflects a normal exposure of an individual when re-entering an area after pesticide application, that is, contact with dried residue of the diluted product on foliage. Methodology has therefore been developed to determine a relevant estimate of this potential dermal re-entry exposure from pesticide residues. Potential delivery platforms have been characterized for the transfer of pesticide residue to skin. Spin coating has been used to deposit uniform pesticide layers on to each platform. Five pesticides have been chosen to encompass a wide range of physicochemical properties: atrazine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), chlorpyrifos, monocrotophos, and acetochlor. In vitro (Franz diffusion cell) experiments have been performed to monitor the transfer of these pesticides from the delivery platforms onto and through excised porcine skin. Parallel experiments were also conducted with aqueous pesticide dilutions for comparison, and a final in vivo measurement using ibuprofen (as a model compound) complemented the in vitro data. The results demonstrate that transfer of chemical residue onto and subsequently through the skin is dependent on the physical attributes of the residue formed. Thus, assessing dermal exposure to pesticides based on skin contact with either the chemical concentrate or a relevant aqueous dilution may incorrectly estimate the risk for re-entry scenarios.",2011,,"Belsey NA, Cordery SF, Bunge AL, Guy RH.",https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/files/242024/Revised_Pesticide_Manuscript_310311.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study, we demonstrated the application of a novel, fast, and cost-effective quantitative toxicogenomics-based approach for the evaluation of the evolution and nature of toxicity along the electro-Fenton oxidative degradation of three representative CECs whose oxidative degradation pathways have been relatively well studied, bisphenol A, triclosan, and ibuprofen. The evolution of toxicity as a result of the transformation of parent chemicals and production of intermediates during the course of degradation are monitored, and the quantitative toxicogenomics assay results revealed the dynamic toxicity changes and mechanisms, as well as their association with identified intermediates during the electro-Fenton oxidation process of the selected CECs. Although for the three CECs, a majority (>75%) of the parent compounds disappeared at the 15 min reaction time, the nearly complete elimination of toxicity required a minimal 30 min reaction time, and they seem to correspond to the disappearance of identified aromatic intermediates. Bisphenol A led to a wide range of stress responses, and some identified transformation products containing phenolic or quinone group, such as 1,4-benzoquinone and hydroquinone, likely contributed to the transit toxicity exhibited as DNA stress (genotoxicity) and membrane stress during the degradation. Triclosan is known to cause severe oxidative stress, and although the oxidative damage potential decreased concomitantly with the disappearance of triclosan after a 15 min reaction, the sustained toxicity associated with both membrane and protein stress was likely attributed at least partially to the production of 2,4-dichlorophenol that is known to cause the production of abnormal proteins and affect the cell membrane. Ibuprofen affects the cell transporter function and exhibited significantly high membrane stress related to both membrane structure and function. Oxidative degradation of ibuprofen led to a shift in its toxicity profile from mainly membrane stress to one that exhibited not only sustained membrane stress but also protein stress and DNA stress. The information-rich and high-resolution toxicogenomics results served as ""fingerprints"" that discerned and revealed the toxicity mechanism at the molecular level among the CECs and their oxidation transformation products. This study demonstrated that the quantitative toxicogenomics assay can serve as a useful tool for remediation technology efficacy assessment and provide guidance about process design and optimization for desired toxicity elimination and risk reduction.",2014,,"Gou N, Yuan S, Lan J, Gao C, Alshawabkeh AN, Gu AZ.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es501222t,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Here, we demonstrate that metal complex-mediated, autolytic release of active metallodrugs can be successfully employed to prepare clinical grade (radio-)pharmaceuticals. Optimization of the Lewis-acidic metal ion, chelate, amino acid linker, and biological targeting vector provides means to release peptide-based (radio-)metallopharmaceuticals in solution and from the solid phase using metal-mediated, autolytic amide bond cleavage (MMAAC). Our findings indicate that coordinative polarization of an amide bond by strong, trivalent Lewis acids such as Ga<sup>3+</sup> and Sc<sup>3+</sup> adjacent to serine results in the N, O acyl shift and hydrolysis of the corresponding ester without dissociation of the corresponding metal complex. Compound [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-<b>10</b>, incorporating a cleavable and noncleavable functionalization, was used to demonstrate that only the amide bond-adjacent serine effectively triggered hydrolysis in solution and from the solid phase.

We also compare the antiaggregation propensity of naproxen with that of ibuprofen. Naproxen's antiaggregation effect is influenced by two factors. Similar to ibuprofen, naproxen destabilizes binding of incoming Aβ peptides to the fibril due to direct competition between the ligands and the peptides for the same binding location on the fibril surface (the edge). However, in contrast to ibuprofen, naproxen binding also alters the conformational ensemble of Aβ monomers by promoting β-structure. The second factor weakens naproxen's antiaggregation effect.

The film properties were either varied by the preparation route, i.e., spin coating or drop casting, or via changes in the relative ratio of the ibuprofen and the matrix material. The resulting films were investigated via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscope experiments. The results show that preferred (100) textures can be induced via spin coating with respect to the glass surface, while the drop casting results in a powder-like behavior. The morphologies of the films are strongly impacted by the ibuprofen amount rather than the preparation method. A comparison of the various matrix materials in terms of their impact on the dissolution properties show a two times faster zero order release from methyl cellulose matrix compared to a polystyrene matrix. The slowest rate was observed within the hydroxyl ethyl cellulose as the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) release is limited by diffusion through a swollen matrix.

However, its clinical use is hampered by a limited brain distribution. The aim of this study was to design and synthesize brain-targeting dexibuprofen prodrugs and to evaluate their brain-targeting efficiency using biodistribution and pharmacokinetic analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>In vitro stability, biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats. The concentrations of dexibuprofen in biosamples, including the plasma, brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, were measured using high pressure lipid chromatography (HPLC). The pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug in the plasma and tissues were calculated using obtained data and statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Five dexibuprofen prodrugs that were modified to contain ethanolamine-related structures were designed and synthesized. Their chemical structures were confirmed using (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, and HRMS. In the biodistribution study, 10 min after intravenous administration of dexibuprofen (11.70 mg/kg) and its prodrugs (the dose of each compound was equivalent to 11.70 mg/kg of dexibuprofen) in male Sprague-Dawley rats, the dexibuprofen concentrations in the brain and plasma were measured.

Thus, the pharmacological manipulation of Hsp70 levels in cancer cells may be an effective means of preventing the progression of tumours. We found that the downregulation of Hsp70 by ibuprofen in vitro enhances the antitumoural activity of cisplatin in lung cancer. Ibuprofen prominently suppressed the expression of Hsp70 in A549 cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and sensitized them to cisplatin in association with an increase in the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, whereas ibuprofen alone did not induce cell death. The cisplatin-dependent events occurring up- and downstream of mitochondrial disruption were accelerated by treatment with ibuprofen. The increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis caused by the depletion of Hsp70 by RNA interference is evidence that the increased apoptosis by ibuprofen is mediated by its effect on Hsp70. Our observations indicate that the suppression of Hsp70 by ibuprofen mediates the sensitivity to cisplatin by enhancing apoptosis at several stages of the mitochondrial cascade. Ibuprofen, therefore, is a potential therapeutic agent that might allow lowering the doses of cisplatin and limiting the many challenge associated with its toxicity and development of drug resistance.",2014,,"Endo H, Yano M, Okumura Y, Kido H.",https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.550,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, agents that can topically induce PGD(2) for itch relief are not well established. The antimycotic sertaconazole nitrate (STZ) has been shown to exhibit anti-itch properties; however, the mechanism for this activity has not been elucidated. STZ mitigated degranulation of RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia) mast cells induced by compound 48/80, a pruritogenic agent known to promote the release of histamine, and augmented PGD(2) production in mast cells and macrophages. Addition of exogenous PGD(2) abrogated compound 48/80-induced degranulation by acting through the prostanoid D receptor 1 (DP1). STZ induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in mast cells and a pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, resulted in the attenuation of PGD(2) levels. Finally, in a murine model of pruritus, the scratching behavior induced by compound 48/80 was mitigated by topical application of STZ. This effect was reversed by the addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, or a DP1 receptor antagonist (MK0524). Collectively, these results suggest that STZ mediates its anti-itch effects by boosting the antipruritic agent, PGD(2), by the activation of the p38-MAPK pathway.

There are currently no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines for the disease. EBOV has a membrane envelope decorated by trimers of a glycoprotein (GP, cleaved by furin to form GP1 and GP2 subunits), which is solely responsible for host cell attachment, endosomal entry and membrane fusion. GP is thus a primary target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here we report the first, to our knowledge, unliganded structure of EBOV GP, and high-resolution complexes of GP with the anticancer drug toremifene and the painkiller ibuprofen. The high-resolution apo structure gives a more complete and accurate picture of the molecule, and allows conformational changes introduced by antibody and receptor binding to be deciphered. Unexpectedly, both toremifene and ibuprofen bind in a cavity between the attachment (GP1) and fusion (GP2) subunits at the entrance to a large tunnel that links with equivalent tunnels from the other monomers of the trimer at the three-fold axis. Protein–drug interactions with both GP1 and GP2 are predominately hydrophobic. Residues lining the binding site are highly conserved among filoviruses except Marburg virus (MARV), suggesting that MARV may not bind these drugs. Thermal shift assays show up to a 14 °C decrease in the protein melting temperature after toremifene binding, while ibuprofen has only a marginal effect and is a less potent inhibitor. These results suggest that inhibitor binding destabilizes GP and triggers premature release of GP2, thereby preventing fusion between the viral and endosome membranes.

Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is the predominant Ca(2+) entry mechanism in most cancer cells, and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) sensor for store-operated channels. Here we reported that the STIM1 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. STIM1 overexpression in CRC was significantly associated with tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis status and serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen. Furthermore, ectopic expression of STIM1 promoted CRC cell motility, while depletion of STIM1 with short hairpin RNA inhibited CRC cell migration. Our data further suggested that STIM1 promoted CRC cell migration through increasing the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Importantly, ectopically expressed COX-2 or exogenous PGE2 were able to rescue migration defect in STIM1 knockdown CRC cells, and inhibition of COX-2 with ibuprofen and indomethacin abrogated STIM1-mediated CRC cell motility. In short, our data provided clinicopathological significance for STIM1 and SOCE in CRC progression, and implicated a role for COX-2 in STIM1-mediated CRC metastasis.

Considering the high abundance of cell-free DNA encoding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in both clinical and environmental settings, natural transformation is an important horizontal gene transfer pathway to transmit antibiotic resistance. It is acknowledged that antibiotics are key drivers for disseminating antibiotic resistance, yet the contributions of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals on transformation of ARGs are overlooked. In this study, we report that some commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, at clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly facilitated the spread of antibiotic resistance through the uptake of exogenous ARGs. This included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, the lipid-lowering drug, gemfibrozil, and the β-blocker propranolol. Based on the results of flow cytometry, whole-genome RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis, the enhanced transformation of ARGs was affiliated with promoted bacterial competence, enhanced stress levels, over-produced reactive oxygen species and increased cell membrane permeability.

The use of antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations has been recognized as an important factor in disseminating antibiotic resistance via horizontal gene transfer. Although non-antibiotic, human-targeted pharmaceuticals are widely used by society (95% of the pharmaceuticals market), the potential contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance is not clear.

Various indicators were used to study the bacterial response to these drugs, including monitoring reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell membrane permeability by flow cytometry, cell arrangement, and whole-genome RNA and protein sequencing. Enhanced conjugation correlated well with increased production of ROS and cell membrane permeability. Additionally, these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals induced responses similar to those detected when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, such as inducing the SOS response and enhancing efflux pumps.

In this study, we investigated the role of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in chronic pain-induced persistent anxiety in mice and explored potential drug targets. Chronic inflammatory pain was induced in mice by bilateral injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the planta of the hind paws; anxiety-like behaviours were assessed with behavioural tests; S-nitrosylation and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission were examined using biochemical assays and electrophysiological recordings, respectively. We found that CFA induced persistent upregulation of AMPAR membrane expression and function in the vmPFC of anxious mice but not in the vmPFC of non-anxious mice. The anxious mice exhibited higher S-nitrosylation of stargazin (an AMPAR-interacting protein) in the vmPFC. Inhibition of S-nitrosylation by bilaterally infusing an exogenous stargazin (C302S) mutant into the vmPFC rescued the surface expression of GluA1 and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission as well as the anxiety-like behaviours in CFA-injected mice, even after ibuprofen treatment. Moreover, administration of ZL006, a small molecular inhibitor disrupting the interaction of nNOS and PSD-95 (20 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, for 5 days, i.p.), significantly reduced nitric oxide production and S-nitrosylation of AMPAR-interacting proteins in the vmPFC, resulting in anxiolytic-like effects in anxious mice after ibuprofen treatment.

Clinical E. coli strains were exposed to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, ampicillin) with or without NSAIDs (acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen). Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed via disk diffusion, while minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MICs/MBCs) were determined to quantify interactions. Membrane integrity was evaluated through cytoplasmic contents release assays. NSAIDs significantly enhanced antibiotic susceptibility, reducing MICs/MBCs in most strains. Membrane leakage assays demonstrated increased release of intracellular components, suggesting compromised membrane integrity.

Three classes of PFTs-alpha-hemolysin (Hla), phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), and the leukocidin HlgAB-directly induced neuronal firing and produced spontaneous pain. From these mechanisms, we hypothesized that pores formed in neurons would allow entry of the membrane-impermeable sodium channel blocker QX-314 into nociceptors to silence pain during infection.

Here, we find that macrophage-derived itaconate promotes HCC by epigenetic induction of Eomesodermin (EOMES)-mediated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion. Our results show that the knockout of immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1), responsible for itaconate production, suppresses HCC progression. Irg1 knockout leads to a decreased proportion of PD-1<sup>+</sup> and TIM-3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Deletion or adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells shows that IRG1-promoted tumorigenesis depends on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion. Mechanistically, itaconate upregulates PD-1 and TIM-3 expression levels by promoting succinate-dependent H3K4me3 of the Eomes promoter. Finally, ibuprofen is found to inhibit HCC progression by targeting IRG1/itaconate-dependent tumor immunoevasion, and high IRG1 expression in macrophages predicts poor prognosis in HCC patients.

This study aims to classify these drugs into harmful and safe categories using knowledge gained from chemoinformatics (i.e., pharmacological similarity with drugs of known fetal effect) and empirical data (i.e., derived from Electronic Health Records). Our fetal loss cohort contains 14,922 affected and 33,043 unaffected pregnancies and our congenital anomalies cohort contains 5,658 affected and 31,240 unaffected infants. We trained a random forest to classify drugs of unknown pregnancy class into harmful or safe categories, focusing on two distinct outcomes: fetal loss and congenital anomalies. Our models achieved an out-of-bag accuracy of 91% for fetal loss and 87% for congenital anomalies outperforming null models. Fifty-seven 'category C' medications were classified as harmful for fetal loss and eleven for congenital anomalies. This includes medications with documented harmful effects, including naproxen, ibuprofen and rubella live vaccine. We also identified several novel drugs, e.g., haloperidol, that increased the risk of fetal loss. Our approach provides important information on the harmfulness of 'category C' drugs.

Forty-two Swiss mice were divided into seven groups: controls; amoxicillin; amoxicillin/clavulanate; erythromycin; acetaminophen; ibuprofen and celecoxib, to inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). SEM-EDX analysis was conducted on all cusps of the third molars. Calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), aluminum, potassium, sodium, magnesium and chlorine were quantified. The stoichiometric Ca/P molar ratios were calculated. Immunohistochemical quantification of COX2 in incisors was carried out by image analysis using COX2-specific immunostaining. Groups treated with antibiotics showed no significant differences in the content of the chemical elements. Only acetaminophen and celecoxib showed a significant decrease in Ca and P compared with the control samples. Ca/P ratios showed no difference. Groups treated with amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, erythromycin and acetaminophen showed significantly lower amounts of immunoreactive COX2 at the enamel organ maturation stage of the mouse incisors.

We investigated the hypothesis that celecoxib activates AMP kinase (AMPK) signalling to enhance vascular endothelial protection. In human arterial and venous endothelial cells (EC), and in contrast to ibuprofen and naproxen, celecoxib induced the protective protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Celecoxib derivative 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC) which lacks COX-2 inhibition also upregulated HO-1, implicating a COX-2-independent mechanism. Celecoxib activated AMPKα<sup>(Thr172)</sup> and CREB-1<sup>(Ser133)</sup> phosphorylation leading to Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Importantly, these responses were not reproduced by ibuprofen or naproxen, while AMPKα silencing abrogated celecoxib-mediated CREB and Nrf2 activation. Moreover, celecoxib induced H-ferritin via the same pathway, and increased HO-1 and H-ferritin in the aortic endothelium of mice fed celecoxib (1000 ppm) or control chow. Functionally, celecoxib inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB p65<sup>(Ser536)</sup> phosphorylation by activating AMPK. This attenuated VCAM-1 upregulation via induction of HO-1, a response reproduced by DMC but not ibuprofen or naproxen. Similarly, celecoxib prevented IL-1β-mediated induction of IL-6. Celecoxib enhances vascular protection via AMPK-CREB-Nrf2 signalling, a mechanism which may mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients prescribed celecoxib.

When C. carpio were exposed to 0.1 μM NSAIDs, 10 μM persulfate (PS), and 0.1 μM DPs of the NSAIDs for 96 h, respectively, the toxicity effects are as the NSAID DPs > PS > NSAIDs. Research results into the time-dependent effect of NSAID DPs on C. carpio demonstrated that obvious toxicity effects were observed in the first 48 hours, and the toxicity effects strengthened over time.

We compared PBUT removal between HD, hemodiafiltration (HDF), membrane adsorption, and PBUT displacement in HD.

The main objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of limonene (LIM) based THEDES as new possible systems for cancer treatment. LIM is known to have antitumor activity, however it is highly toxic and cell viability is often compromised, thus this compound is not selective towards cancer cells. Different THEDES based on LIM were developed to unravel the anticancer potential of such systems. THEDES were prepared by gently mixing saturated fatty acids menthol or ibuprofen (IBU) with LIM. Successful THEDES were obtained for Menthol:LIM (1:1), CA:LIM (1:1), IBU:LIM (1:4) and IBU:LIM(1:8). The results indicate that all the THEDES present antiproliferative properties, but IBU:LIM (1:4) was the only formulation able to inhibit HT29 proliferation without comprising cell viability. Therefore, IBU:LIM (1:4) was the formulation selected for further assessment of anticancer properties. The results suggest that the mechanism of action of LIM:IBU (1:4) is different from isolated IBU and LIM, which suggest the synergetic effect of DES. In this work, we unravel a methodology to tune the selectivity of LIM towards HT29 cell line without compromising cell viability of healthy cells. We demonstrate furthermore that coupling LIM with IBU leads also to an enhancement of the anti-inflammatory activity of IBU, which may be important in anti-cancer therapies.",2019,,"Pereira CV, Silva JM, Rodrigues L, Reis RL, Paiva A, Duarte ARC, Matias A.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51472-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this work, we propose to infuse a competitor drug into the extracorporeal circuit that increases the free fraction of a toxic drug and thereby increases its dialytic removal. We used a mechanistic model to assess the removal of phenytoin and carbamazepine during HD with or without binding-competition. We simulated dialytic removal of (1) phenytoin, initial concentration 70 mg/L, using 2000 mg aspirin, (2) carbamazepine, initial concentration 35 mg/L, using 800 mg ibuprofen, in a 70 kg patient. The competitor drug was infused at constant rate. For phenytoin (~ 13% free at t = 0), HD brings the patient to therapeutic concentration in 460 min while aspirin infusion reduces that time to 330 min. For carbamazepine (~ 27% free at t = 0), the ibuprofen infusion reduces the HD time to reach therapeutic concentration from 265 to 220 min. Competitor drugs with longer half-life further reduce the HD time. Binding-competition during HD is a potential treatment for drug toxicities for which current recommendations exclude HD due to strong drug-protein binding.

Loss-of-function mutations of vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) gene (AVPR2) is the most common cause of the disease. We have identified five novel mutations L86P, R113Q, C192S, M272R, and W323_I324insR from NDI-affected patients. Functional characterization of these mutants revealed that R113Q and C192S were normally localized at the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and presented proper glycosylation maturation. On the other side, L86P, M272R, and W323_I324insR mutants were retained in endoplasmic reticulum and exhibited immature glycosylation and considerably reduced stability.

Further, assay for cytotoxicity and scanning electron microscopic images of cell seeded mats after 5 days showed the mats were not cytotoxic.

However, ozonation catalysts with combined merits of high activity, good reusability and low cost for practical industrial applications are still rare. This study aims to develop an efficient, stable and economic ozonation catalyst for the degradation of Ibuprofen, a pharmaceutical compound frequently detected as a refractory pollutant in treated wastewaters. The novel three-dimensional network-structured catalyst, comprising of δ-MnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets grown on woven carbon microfibers (MnO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets/carbon microfiber), was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach. Catalytic ozonation performance of Ibuprofen removal in water using the new catalyst proves a significant enhancement, where Ibuprofen removal efficiency of close to 90% was achieved with a catalyst loading of 1% (w/v). In contrast, conventional ozonation was only able to achieve 65% removal efficiency under the same operating condition. The enhanced performance with the new catalyst could be attributed to its significantly increased available surface active sites and improved mass transfer of reaction media, as a result of the special surface and structure properties of this new three-dimensional network-structured catalyst.

Cromolyn, in a new redesigned dry powder formulation, is being tested in a pivotal clinical trial in combination with low dose ibuprofen to treat early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects. To better understand the mechanistic effect cromolyn has in slowing down or halting the neuroinflammatory response associated with AD progression, we tested the effect of cromolyn to dampen the inflammatory response in the human HMC3 microglia cell line. The direct effect of cromolyn on HMC3 microglia is on cytokines and chemokines production following their activation by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Cromolyn and a new fluorinated analog dramatically reduced the secretion of a wide spectrum of inflammatory mediators, which included cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-γ, and chemokines such as CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are known to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, but how NSAIDs affect oxylipins, in addition to COX products, in animal tissues is not well understood. Oxylipins in livers from male and female mice treated with 100 mg/kg/day of ibuprofen for 7 days were investigated. The results showed that ibuprofen treated male livers contained 7 times more altered oxylipins than ibuprofen treated female livers. In male and female livers some prostaglandins were altered, while diols, hydroxy fatty acids and epoxides were significantly altered in male livers. Some soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) products, such as 9,10-DiHODE were found to be decreased, while sEH substrates (such as 9(10)-EpODE and 5(6)-EpETrE) were found to be increased in male livers treated with ibuprofen, but not in ibuprofen treated female livers. The enzymatic activities of sEH and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) were elevated by ibuprofen in both males and females. Analyzing the influence of sex on the effect of ibuprofen on oxylipins and COX products showed that approximately 27% of oxylipins detected were influenced by sex. The results reveal that ibuprofen disturbs not only the COX pathway, but also the CYP450 and lipoxygenase pathways in male mice, suggesting that ibuprofen is likely to generate sex related differences in biologically active oxylipins. Increased sEH activity after ibuprofen treatment is likely to be one of the mechanisms by which the liver reduces the higher levels of EpODEs and EpETrEs.",2021,,"Tiwari S, Yang J, Morisseau C, Durbin-Johnson B, Hammock BD, Gomes AV.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86284-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However current microneedle technologies may not have the mechanical properties for reliable and stable penetration (e.g. hydrogel microneedles). Moreover, it is also challenging to realize microneedle arrays with large size and high flexibility. There is also an inherent upper limit to the amount and kind of drugs that can be loaded in the microneedles. In this paper, we present a new class of polymeric porous microneedles made from biocompatible and photo-curable resin that address these challenges. The microneedles are unique in their ability to load solid drug formulation in concentrated form. We demonstrate the loading and release of solid formulation of anesthetic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, namely Lidocaine and Ibuprofen. Paper also demonstrates realization of large area (6 × 20 cm<sup>2</sup>) flexible and stretchable microneedle patches capable of drug delivery on any body part. Penetration studies were performed in an ex vivo porcine model supplemented through rigorous compression tests to ensure the robustness and rigidity of the microneedles.

Low toxicity and favorable physical, Lipinski-type, and solubility properties were elucidated by ADME-tox studies. Molecular docking of SAPE against COX-2 revealed favorable MolDockscore, rerank score, interaction energy, internal pose energy, and hydrogen bonding as compared to ibuprofen and indomethacin. An average RMSD of ~ 0.13 nm for the docked complex with stable dynamic equilibrium condition was noted during the 20 ns MD simulation. A low band gap predicting a strong binding affinity at the enzyme's active site was further predicted by DFT analysis. The ester caused a reduction in the percentage of erythrocyte hemolysis and was shown to be non-cytotoxic against human lymphocytes, CaCo-2, and HepG-2 cells by the MTT assay. Moreover, it's in vitro efficacy in inhibiting COX-2 enzyme under both LPS stimulated intestinal cells and direct sequestration assays was found to be higher than salicylic acid and indomethacin. The anticancer activity of SAPE was tested on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and potential efficacy was exhibited in terms of decreased cell viability. Flow cytometry analysis exhibited the arrest of the cell cycle at G1/G0 and S phases, during which induction of autophagic vesicle formation and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed owing to increased ROS production. Furthermore, at these phases, the onset of apoptosis along with DNA damage was also observed. Pre-treatment with SAPE in colitis-induced Wistar rats displayed low disease activity index and reduction in the extent of intestinal tissue disruption and lipid peroxidation. A marked increase of anti-oxidative enzymes viz., catalase, GGT, and GST, and a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in the intestinal tissue extracts of the treated groups was noted. The results of this study have sufficient credence to support that the synthesised ester (SAPE) be considered as an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory compound with therapeutic potential for the effective management of cancer.",2022,,"Das AJ, Das MK, Singh SP, Saikia PP, Singh N, Islam J, Ansari A, Chattopadhyay P, Rajamani P, Miyaji T, Deka SC.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12524-7.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The prepared photocatalysts (PCs) are employed under simulated sunlight (SL) for the degradation of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, ibuprofen pharmaceuticals, methylene blue dye, and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) pesticide. The prepared photocatalysts are characterized in detail using several compositional, optical, and morphological techniques. The influence of the CuS (QDs) wt. % on morphological, structural, as well as photocatalytic degradation efficiency have been investigated. The small displacement between the (107) plane of CuS and the (102) plane of ZnO can confirmed the existence of lattice interaction, implying the formation of p-n heterojunctions. TEM and XRD results demonstrated that the CuS QDs are established and uniformly decorated on the surface of ZnO NRs, confirming the forming of an efficient CuS QDs @ ZnO heterojunction nanostructures. The CuS QDs @ ZnO hybrid nanocomposites showed enhancement in crystallinity, light absorption, surface area, separation of e-h pair and inhibition in their recombination at an interfacial heterojunction. In addition it is found that, 3 wt% CuS QDs @ ZnO has the foremost influence. The results showed improvement of photocatalytic activity of the 3% CuS QDs @ ZnO hybrid nanocomposite as compared to the bare ZnO nanorods. The impressive photocatalytic performance of CuS @ ZnO heterostructure nanorods may be attributed to efficient charge transfer. The prepared CuS QDs @ ZnO hybrid nanocomposites exhibited 100% removal for MB dye, after 45 min, and after 60 min for ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin pharmaceuticals, and 2.4.5 trichloro phenoxy acetic acid pesticide with the catalyst amount of 0.2 g/L. Although 100% removal of ceftriaxone pharmaceutical acheived after 90 min. In addition CuS QDs @ ZnO hybrid nanocomposites exhibited complete removal of COD for ibuprofen, ceftriaxone pharmaceuticals and 2.4.5 trichloro phenoxy acetic acid pesticide after 2 h with no selectivity.

ECa 233, a standardized Centella asiatica extract, is highly anti-inflammatory and safe. We investigated its therapeutic effects by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into right temporomandibular joint of mice and administering either ibuprofen or ECa 233 (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) for 28 days. Inflammatory and nociceptive markers, bone density, and pain hypersensitivity were examined. CFA decreased ipsilateral bone density, suggesting inflammation localization, which ipsilaterally caused immediate calcitonin gene-related peptide elevation in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (TNC), followed by late increase of NaV1.7 in TG and of p-CREB and activation of microglia in TNC. Contralaterally, only p-CREB and activated microglia in TNC showed delayed increase. Pain hypersensitivity, which developed early ipsilaterally, but late contralaterally, was reduced by ibuprofen and ECa 233 (30 or 100 mg/kg). However, ibuprofen and only 100-mg/kg ECa 233 effectively mitigated marker elevation. This suggests 30-mg/kg ECa 233 was antinociceptive, whereas 100-mg/kg ECa 233 was both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive.

The electronic, optical, and interaction properties are investigated using density functional theory calculations. The Clar's Goblet membranes (CGMs) that were chosen are semiconductors with an energy gap of around 1.5 eV, according to energy gap calculations and density of states. Molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis shows that CGMs have electrophilic and nucleophilic sites, suggesting their suitability for interacting with pharmaceutical pollutants. The adsorption energies confirm the chemical adsorption of pharmaceutical pollutants with diclofenac showing the strongest adsorption. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of CGMs-drug complexes are analyzed, revealing a redshift compared to the absorption spectrum of CGMs alone, confirming the adsorption of these drugs. Further analysis using hole/electron examinations indicates that the type of excitation is local excitation rather than charge transfer excitation. This study quantitatively characterized hole and electron distribution in excited states using various indices. The analysis revealed local excitation transitions and significant charge transfer between the CGMs molecule and pharmaceutical pollutants. Additionally, non-covalent interaction analysis indicates the presence of van der Waals interactions, highlighting the adsorption behavior of the drugs.

For this purpose, lactide was polymerized on the surface of cotton textiles to achieve better compatibility with hydrophobic drug and polylactide (PLA)-based macromolecules. Subsequently, ibuprofen-loaded PLA and PLA-PEG were implemented through the exhausting method. Such material was tested for cytotoxicity (toward L929 mouse fibroblasts) and anti-inflammatory activity (towards human Hs68 fibroblasts) based on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. The results showed that the drug attachment and its performance are influenced by a combination of mercerization, bleaching and polylactide grafting, and the release of ibuprofen depends on the drug-loaded layer structure.

Microemulsions (ME) were selected as the main carriers for this study, but a comparison with liposomes was performed to observe if different organization of the lipophilic and hydrophilic compartments influences the loading capacity and controlled release of these two drugs. Using Maisine CC, a biocompatible oil, and Tween 20 as the surfactant, normal oil-in-water ME loaded with FU and IBU (1:1, 1:3, 1:6, wt:wt) were prepared by the water titration method. MEs were characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and DOSY spectroscopies to assess their droplet size, surface charge, structure and type of emulsion. Intermolecular interactions between drugs and components of the ME's matrix were investigated by FT-IR, RAMAN and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopies. The experimental results of DOSY revealed that all components of MEs are gathered in normal oil-in-water ME. Due to their different affinities for the main components of the ME, FU, and IBU were mainly distributed in the aqueous and oily phases, respectively, as supported by the droplet size measured by DLS. It was observed that co-loading the two drugs impacted the release behavior, assessed by the dialysis bag method, as compared with the mono-drug formulations. Based on the findings of this work, a release mechanism for FU and IBU was proposed, as well. Overall, the ME proved to be more suitable nanocarriers since the drugs, which were loaded in higher amounts as compared to liposomes, followed a controlled and sustained release of at least 96 h.",2025,,"Nistor M, Nicolescu A, Amarandi RM, Pui A, Stiufiuc RI, Dragoi B.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-89540-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This method effectively solves the coupled non-linear system of second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), incorporating the mass transfer associated with the DKR reaction rate. The DKR rate equations are computed utilizing both enantiomers, which represent the enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate within the barrier's support matrix, where the racemization term is negligible. Additionally, the corresponding racemization of the unreacted substrate outside the membrane is considered, where the enzymatic hydrolysis term is negligible. The dimensionless steady-state solution for the dynamics of the mean integrated effectiveness factor (MIEF) related to convective hydrolysis-racemization phenomena quantifies the local effectiveness factor, which impacts the Thiele modulus and the bulk initial concentrations of a substance within the membrane layer. The Bodenstein number is a critical parameter that optimizes reaction conditions, enhances mixing efficiency, and mitigates mass transfer limitations. The normalized values from the sensitivity analysis are analyzed to identify the key parameters of the present system. The conversion efficiency and limitations of the proposed model utilizing HPM are presented. Our proposed solution compares the semi-analytical expression with the simulated numerical results of BVP-4c using the built-in solver in MATLAB R2023b software, demonstrating good agreement across all values of the reaction parameters. The agreement between semi-analytical and numerical computations demonstrates the validity of these approximation methods. The findings provide significant insights for enhancing membrane reactor design and improving the efficiency of industrial processes for racemic ibuprofen ester production.",2025,,"Ahmed LN, Thomas P.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-89583-z,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

While dietary sources of these allergens are well-studied, their presence in medicinal products remains under-explored. This study assessed the prevalence of gluten and soy-derived excipients in 308 medicinal products authorized for marketing in Portugal. A systematic search of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) database was conducted for 108 analgesics and antipyretics containing paracetamol, 85 NSAIDs containing ibuprofen, and 115 antiasthmatic and bronchodilator medicinal products. The study found significant associations between pharmacotherapeutic groups and the presence of these allergens (p < 0.001). Gluten was more prevalent in the group of analgesics and antipyretics (44.4%) than in NSAIDs (8.2%), whereas soy-derived excipients were more frequent in NSAIDs (14%) than in analgesics and antipyretics (6.5%). No excipients containing gluten or soy were identified in antiasthmatic and bronchodilator medicinal products. In analgesics and antipyretics, 51.2% of solid oral dosage forms and 40% of liquid oral formulations contained gluten. Within the NSAIDs group, gluten was mainly present in liquid oral dosage forms (26.7%). Soy-derived excipients were found in 30% of liquid oral formulations and in 33.3% of rectal dosage forms of analgesics and antipyretics. In the NSAIDs group, soy was more prevalent in liquid oral formulations (26.7%). These findings highlight the need for clearer labeling of allergens in medicinal products and underscore the importance of vigilance for patients with gluten or soy allergies. Further research is required to address gaps in allergen disclosure by pharmaceutical manufacturers and to promote safer medicinal product use for sensitive populations. Enhanced awareness among healthcare providers and patients is essential to mitigate the risk of allergic reactions associated with hidden excipients in medicinal products.",2025,,"Figueiredo A, Auxtero MD, Brás A, Casimiro A, Costa IM.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-95525-6,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The composite was fabricated by embedding copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) within a ZnO/ZrO<sub>2</sub>nanocomposite structure, supported by poly acrylonitrilepolymer. Material characterization was performed using FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDX, BET, and UV-Vis DRS techniques, showing a notable specific surface area of synthesized composite about 156 m²/g, pore size of 18.4 nm, and evenly dispersed nanoparticles measuring 20 to 30 nm on average. Under visible light exposure, the composite demonstrated photo-oxidation efficiencies of 85% for Pb(II) and 80% for Cd(II) within 120 min, with starting concentrations of 50 mg/L. For pharmaceutical contaminants, degradation rates reached 88% for ibuprofen and 90% for sulfamethoxazole under similar conditions. Adsorption isotherms followed the Langmuir model, with maximum adsorption capacities of 36.0 mg/g for both Pb(II) and Cd(II). Pharmaceutical pollutants showed lower adsorption capacities, with q<sub>max</sub> values of 30.0 mg/g for sulfamethoxazole and 28.0 mg/g for ibuprofen. Kinetic studies indicated that the degradation process followed a pseudo-second-order model (R² > 0.98), and the composite retained 85% of its photocatalytic activity after five reuse cycles.

The increase in drug resistant Mtb strains is a major public health emergency and host-directed therapy as adjunct to antibiotic treatment has gained increased interest. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COXi) are frequently used drugs to alleviate tuberculosis related symptoms. Mouse studies of acute intravenous Mtb infection have suggested a potential benefit of COXi for host-directed therapy. Here we show that COXi treatment (ibuprofen and celecoxib) is detrimental to Mtb control in different mouse models of respiratory infection. This effect links to impairments of the Type-1 helper (Th1) T-cell response as CD4 T-cells in COXi-treated animals have significantly decreased Th1 differentiation, reduced IFNγ expression and decreased protective capacity upon adoptive transfer. If confirmed in clinical trials, these findings could have major impact on global health and question the use of COXi for host-directed therapy.",2019,,"Mortensen R, Clemmensen HS, Woodworth JS, Therkelsen ML, Mustafa T, Tonby K, Jenum S, Agger EM, Dyrhol-Riise AM, Andersen P.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-019-0530-3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Conversely, the consequences on postnatal ovarian development and female reproductive health after in utero exposure are unknown. Here, we found that in mice, in utero exposure to therapeutic doses of the APAP-ibuprofen combination during sex determination led to delayed meiosis entry and progression in female F1 embryonic germ cells. Consequently, follicular activation was reduced in postnatal ovaries through the AKT/FOXO3 pathway, leading in F2 animals to subfertility, accelerated ovarian aging with abnormal corpus luteum persistence, due to decreased apoptosis and increased AKT-mediated luteal cell survival.

In this study, we demonstrate that expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is upregulated in normal cells surrounding RasV12-transformed cells. Addition of COX inhibitor or COX-2-knockout promotes apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. Furthermore, production of Prostaglandin (PG) E<sub>2</sub>, a downstream prostanoid of COX-2, is elevated in normal cells surrounding RasV12 cells, and addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> suppresses apical extrusion of RasV12 cells. In a cell competition mouse model, expression of COX-2 is elevated in pancreatic epithelia harbouring RasV12-exressing cells, and the COX inhibitor ibuprofen promotes apical extrusion of RasV12 cells.

Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate a 3-fold increase in vivo bioavailability of BJ compared to that of BBR, and BJ is more effective in treating obesity and its related metabolism in vitro and in vivo. We also find that BJ promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by inhibiting TBK1 and inducing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, and BJ increases adipocyte sensitivity to catecholamine by inhibiting IKKε.

In addition to antibiotics, pharmaceutical plants also produce non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, both the active ingredients and other components of the formulations. The effect of these on the surrounding microbial communities is less clear. We aimed to assess whether non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals and other compounds produced by pharmaceutical plants have inherent toxicity, and whether long-term exposure might result in significant genetic changes or select for cross-resistance to antibiotics. To this end, we screened four non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, propranolol, metformin) and titanium dioxide for toxicity against Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and conducted a 30 day selection experiment to assess the effect of long-term exposure. All compounds reduced the maximum optical density reached by E. coli at a range of concentrations including one of environmental relevance, with transcriptome analysis identifying upregulated genes related to stress response and multidrug efflux in response ibuprofen treatment. The compounds did not select for significant genetic changes following a 30 day exposure, and no evidence of selection for cross-resistance to antibiotics was observed for population evolved in the presence of ibuprofen in spite of the differential gene expression after exposure to this compound.

Increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from symptomatic asthmatic patients. IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) are known to stimulate a number of cells to produce inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins. Although airway smooth muscle (ASM) is known to be a rich source of prostaglandins, the regulation of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) isoforms and prostanoid production by proinflammatory cytokines have not been studied in human airway smooth muscle. 2. We studied the effects of IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IFN gamma on the induction of two isoforms of cyclo-oxygenase and its relation to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release and COX activity (reflected by PGE2 synthesis from exogenous arachidonic acid) in human cultured airway smooth muscle cells. 3. IL-1 beta, but not TNF alpha or IFN gamma, caused a time- and concentration-dependent enhancement in PGE2 and other prostanoid (6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and PGD2) production, with PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha as the principal products. This stimulation was accompanied by a corresponding increase in COX activity. 4. COX-2 protein measured by Western blot analysis was not detectable in untreated cells, but was increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by IL-1 beta, but not TNF alpha or IFN gamma. In contrast, no variation in the expression of COX-1 protein was observed. 5. Pretreatment with the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indomethacin and ibuprofen, and the selective COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 and nimesulide, completely blocked IL-1 beta-induced PGE2 release and COX activity. The glucocorticosteroid dexamethasone and protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide and actinomycin D, not only markedly inhibited IL-1 beta-stimulated PGE2 release and COX activity but also suppressed IL-1 beta-induced COX-2 induction. 6. This study demonstrates that human cultured ASM cells release prostanoids in response to IL-1 beta stimulation and that the response is mostly mediated by the induction of COX-2 rather than COX-1 isoenzyme, implying that airway smooth muscle may be an important source of prostaglandins in human airways and that COX-2 may play an important role in the regulation of the inflammatory process in asthma.",1997,,"Pang L, Knox AJ.",https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0701152,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Endothelin (ET) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide which has been shown to have an important role in the regulation of systemic and renal haemodynamics. In order to elucidate the role of endogenous ET in the kidney, we examined the effects of ET receptor antagonists on systemic and renal vasculature in normotensive anaesthetized rats. 2. Intravenous injection of a selective ETA receptor antagonist, FR139317 (0.5 mumol kg-1, for 20 min) induced a very small fall in blood pressure. Similarly, a non-selective ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, TAK-044 (12.5 mumol kg-1, for 20 min) slightly decreased blood pressure. A selective ETB receptor antagonist, BQ-788 (0.5 mumol kg-1, for 20 min) had no effect of blood pressure. 3. FR139317 and TAK-044 did not affect renal blood flow or calculated renal vascular resistance.

Ibuprofen enantiomers and their respective coenzyme A thioesters were tested in human platelets and blood monocytes to determine their selectivity and potency as inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 (PGHS-1) and PGHS-2. 2. Human blood from volunteers was drawn and allowed to clot at 37 degrees C for 1 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of the test compounds (R-ibuprofen, S-ibuprofen, R-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, S-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, NS-398). Immunoreactive (ir) thromboxane B2 (TXB2) concentrations in serum were determined by a specific EIA assay as an index of the cyclo-oxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1. 3. Heparin-treated blood from the same donors was incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h with the same concentrations of the test compounds in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 microg ml[-1]). The contribution of PGHS-1 was suppressed by pretreatment of the volunteers with aspirin (500 mg; 48 h before venepuncture). As a measure of LPS induced PGHS-2 activity immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 (irPGE2) plasma concentrations were determined by a specific EIA assay. 4. S-ibuprofen inhibited the activity of PGHS-1 (IC50 2.1 microM) and PGHS-2 (IC50 1.6 microM) equally. R-ibuprofen inhibited PGHS-1 (IC50 34.9) less potently than S-ibuprofen and showed no inhibition of PGHS-2 up to 250 microM. By contrast R-ibuprofenoyl-CoA thioester inhibited PGE2 production from LPS-stimulated monocytes almost two orders of magnitude more potently than the generation of TXB2 (IC50 5.6 vs 219 microM). 5. Western blotting of PGHS-2 after LPS induction of blood monocytes showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of PGHS-2 protein expression by ibuprofenoyl-CoA thioesters. 6. These data confirm that S-ibuprofen represents the active entity in the racemate with respect to cyclo-oxygenase activity. More importantly the data suggest a contribution of the R-enantiomer to therapeutic effects not only by chiral inversion to S-ibuprofen but also via inhibition of induction of PGHS-2 mediated by R-ibuprofenoyl-CoA thioester. 7.

The nonsteroidal drug ibuprofen exists as an R(-)- and S(+)-enantiomer. Only the S(+)-enantiomer is an effective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, while the R(-)-enantiomer is inactive in this respect. Thus the molecular mechanism by which R(-)-ibuprofen exerts its anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects remains unknown. 2. In this study the effects of the enantiomers of ibuprofen on modulation of transcription factors have been examined with electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA), transient transfection experiments, confocal immunofluorescence and nuclear import experiments, to determine their selectivity and potency as inhibitors of the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). 3. R(-)-ibuprofen (IC50: 121.8 microM) as well as the S(+)-enantiomer (IC50: 61.7 microM) inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB in response to T-cell stimulation. The effect of ibuprofen was specific because, at concentrations up to 10 mM, ibuprofen did not affect the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) and the activation of NF-kappaB by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Very high concentrations of ibuprofen (20 mM) did not prevent NF-kappaB binding to DNA in vitro.

The effects of exogenous NO and endothelial-derived NO (EDNO) on the afferent arteriole were investigated in the in vitro perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney. Vessels were pre-constricted with angiotensin II (0.1-0.3 nM) or KCl (30 mM). NO was infused directly into the renal artery at concentrations ranging from 30-9000 nM. ODQ (10, 30 microM) was administered to examine the effects of guanylyl cyclase inhibition. Kidneys were treated with ibuprofen (10 microM) to avoid actions of prostaglandins. 2. During angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction, NO elicited vasodilation at concentrations of 30 900 nM (EC50=200 nM) and ODQ caused a 10 fold shift in NO-sensitivity (EC50 1600 nM). During KCl-induced vasoconstriction, NO elicited a maximal dilation of 82+9% at 9000 nM (EC50 2000 nM) and ODQ had no effect. Thus in the presence of ODQ, the NO concentration-response curves for KCI- and angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction were identical (P>0.2). 3. To assess the possible role of cyclic GMP-independent mechanisms in the actions of EDNO, we compared the effects of L-NAME, ODQ and ODQ+L-NAME on acetylcholine-induced vasodilation. Angiotensin II reduced afferent arteriolar diameters from 16.7+/-0.5 to 8.1+/-0.8 microns and acetylcholine fully reversed this effect (16.9+/-0.5 microns). ODQ restored the angiotensin II response in the presence of acetylcholine (7.1+/-0.6 microns) and the subsequent addition of L-NAME had no further effect (6.8+/-0.7 microns). Similarly, L-NAME alone, fully reversed the actions of acetylcholine. 4. Our findings indicate that exogenous NO is capable of eliciting renal afferent arteriolar vasodilation through both cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-independent mechanisms. The cyclic GMP-independent action of NO did not require K+ channel activation, as it could be elicited in the presence of 30 mM KCl.

From this inflammation-evoked increase in basal PGE2 levels, SP and capsaicin significantly increased spinal PGE2 release in a dose-dependent fashion. Capsaicin-evoked increases were blocked dose-dependently by inclusion of S(+) ibuprofen in the capsaicin-containing perfusate. 5.

This study examined the effects of the COX inhibitors, ketorolac and ibuprofen, and the NOS inhibitor L-NAME for their potential to both inhibit the development and reverse tolerance to the antinociceptive action of morphine. 2. Repeated administration of intrathecal morphine (15 micrograms), once daily, resulted in a progressive decline of antinociceptive effect and an increase in the ED50 value in the tailflick and paw pressure tests. Co-administration of ketorolac (30 and 45 micrograms) or S(+) ibuprofen (10 micrograms) with morphine (15 micrograms) prevented the decline of antinociceptive effect and increase in ED50 value. Similar treatment with L-NAME (100 micrograms) exerted weaker effects. Administration of S(+) but not R(-) ibuprofen (10 mg kg-1) had similar effects on systemic administration of morphine (15 mg kg-1). 3. Intrathecal or systemic administration of the COX or NOS inhibitors did not alter the baseline responses in either tests. Acute keterolac or S(+) ibuprofen also did not potentiate the acute actions of spinal or systemic morphine, but chronic intrathecal administration of these agents increased the potency of acute morphine. 4. In animals already tolerant to intrathecal morphine, subsequent administration of ketorolac (30 micrograms) with morphine (15 micrograms) partially restored the antinociceptive effect and ED50 value of acute morphine, reflecting the reversal of tolerance. Intrathecal L-NAME (100 micrograms) exerted a weaker effect. 5.

Cyclo-oxygenase-1 is present constitutively whilst cyclo-oxygenase-2 is expressed primarily after inflammatory insult. The activity of cyclo-oxygenase-1 and -2 results in the production of a variety of potent biological mediators (the prostaglandins) that regulate homeostatic and disease processes. Inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase include the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin, ibuprofen and diclofenac. NSAIDs inhibit cyclo-oxygenase-2 at the site of inflammation, to produce their therapeutic benefits, as well as cyclo-oxygenase-1 in the gastric mucosa, which produces gastric damage. Most recently selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 have been developed and introduced to man for the treatment of arthritis. Moreover, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors may have important therapeutic relevance in the prevention of some cancers or even Alzheimer's disease.

FAAH activity towards both [(3)H]-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) [K(M)=1.5 microM] and [(3)H]-anandamide (AEA) [K(M)=5.4 microM] was demonstrated in the chicken brains. The chicken FAAH was inhibited by the substrate analogues oleyl trifluoromethylketone (OTMK) and diazomethylarachidonyl ketone (DAK) with similar potencies to the rat FAAH. However, in contrast to the rat brain, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and the enantiomers of ibuprofen had very weak effects on chicken brain FAAH. Indomethacin and niflumic acid were found to inhibit rat brain AEA hydrolysis. The inhibition by indomethacin was reversible and competitive, with a K(i) value of 120 microM. Chicken FAAH was less sensitive to indomethacin than its rodent counterpart, but the inhibition was also competitive (K(i)).

Since the role of mechanical stretches in vascular tone regulation is poorly understood, we studied how stretch can influence endothelial tone. 2. Isometric contractions of isolated rat aortic helical strips were recorded. The resting tension was set at 0.7 g, 1.2 g or 2.5 g. Endothelium-preserved strips were precontracted with either phenylephrine or prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)). 3. In control conditions, acetylcholine (ACh) dose-dependently relaxed phenylephrine-precontracted strips independently of resting tension. 4. At 0.7 g resting tension, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors did not reduce ACh-induced relaxation, while either a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor or a NO trapping agent prevented it. At 1.2 g and 2.5 g resting tensions, NOS inhibitors shifted the ACh dose-response curve to the right. 5. After preincubation with indomethacin (5 microM) or ibuprofen (10 and 100 microM), at 0.7 g and 1.2 g resting tensions, ACh induced an endothelium-dependent, dose-dependent contraction. ACh (10(-6) M) increased the contraction up to two times greater the phenylephrine-induced one. Lipoxygenase inhibitors prevented it. At high stretch, the ACh vasorelaxant effect was marginally influenced by cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. Similar results were obtained when aortic strips were precontracted with PGF(2 alpha). 6. Our data indicate that when resting tension is low, ACh mobilizes a stored NO pool that, synergistically with COX-derived metabolites, can relax precontracted strips. COX inhibition up-regulates the lipoxygenase metabolic pathway, accounting for the ACh contractile effect. At an intermediate resting tension, NO production is present, but COX inhibition reveals a lipoxygenase-dependent, ACh-induced contraction. At high resting tension, NO synthesis predominates and COX metabolites influence ACh-induced relaxation marginally.",2000,,"Franchi-Micheli S, Failli P, Mazzetti L, Bani D, Ciuffi M, Zilletti L.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1038/sj.bjp.0703707,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Rat brain hydrolysis of [(3)H]-AEA showed pH dependency with an optimum around pH 8-9. Between pH 6.3 and 8.2, the difference in activity was due to differences in the V(max), rather than the K(M) values. For inhibition of rat brain [(3)H]-AEA metabolism by a series of known FAAH inhibitors, the potencies of the enantiomers of ibuprofen and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) were higher at pH 5.28 than at pH 8.37, whereas the reverse was true for oleyl trifluoromethylketone (OTMK) and arachidonoylserotonin. At both pH values, (-)ibuprofen was a mixed-type inhibitor of FAAH. The K(i)((slope)) and K(i)((intercept)) values for (-)ibuprofen at pH 5.28 were 11 and 143 microM, respectively. At pH 8.37, the corresponding values were 185 and 3950 microM, respectively. The pH dependency for the inhibition by OTMK and (-)ibuprofen was also seen in COS-1 [corrected] cells transiently transfected with either wild type, S152A or C249A FAAH. No differences in potencies between the wild type and mutant enzymes were seen. It is concluded that the pharmacological properties of FAAH are highly pH-dependent.

Similar actions on normal gastric epithelial cells could contribute to NSAID gastropathy. The present work therefore compared the actions of diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and the cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor, NS-398, on a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells. Cell number was assessed by staining with crystal violet. Apoptotic activity was determined by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei and by assay of caspase-3-like activity. Necrosis was evaluated from release of cellular enzymes. Ibuprofen (250 microM for 24 h) promoted cell loss, and apoptosis, under both basal conditions and when apoptosis was increased by 25 microM N-Hexanoyl-D-sphingosine (C(6)-ceramide). Diclofenac (250 microM for 24 h) reduced the proportion of apoptotic nuclei from 5.2 to 2.1%, and caused inhibition of caspase-3-like activity, without causing necrosis under basal conditions. No such reduction in apoptotic activity was evident in the presence of 25 microM C(6)-ceramide. The inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal caspase-3-like activity was also exhibited by the structurally similar mefenamic and flufenamic acids (1 - 250 microM), but not by niflumic acid. Inhibition of superoxide production by the cells increased caspase-3-like activity, but the inhibitory action of diclofenac on caspase activity remained. Diclofenac did not affect superoxide production. Diclofenac inhibited caspase-3-like activity in cell homogenates and also inhibited human recombinant caspase-3. In conclusion, NSAIDs vary in their effect on apoptotic activity in a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells, and the inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal apoptosis could involve an action on caspase activity.",2002,,"Ashton M, Hanson PJ.",https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0704497,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The L-arginine-NO pathway has been implicated in the vasorelaxant effect of 17-beta-oestradiol. Here we have addressed the involvement of two distinct activation steps of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the 17-beta-oestradiol-induced vasorelaxant effect on rat aortic rings. 2. Rat aortic rings contracted with phenylephrine (PE) 1 microM relaxed in a concentration related fashion to 17-beta-oestradiol water soluble cyclodextrin-encapsulated (E2) only when endothelium was present. The pure anti-oestrogen of E2 receptor ICI 182,780 (20 microM) significantly inhibited E2-induced vasorelaxation. 3. Geldanamycin (10 microM), a specific inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, significantly inhibited E2-induced vasorelaxation. 4. Incubation of rat aortic rings up to 6 h with LY 294002 (25 microM), a specific inhibitor of PI(3)K akt/pkb pathway reduced E2-induced vasorelaxation. 5.

PGI(2) levels, measured as 6-keto PGF(1alpha), were abolished by ibuprofen (10 microM), both L-NAME and GA did not influence basal or E2-stimulated PGI(2) confirming the specificity of these two compounds on eNOS pathway. 6.

Ibuprofen gels were administered in vivo for 30 minutes. The stratum corneum (SC) at the application site was then tape-stripped, quantified gravimetrically, and extracted for drug analysis. Together with concomitant transepidermal water loss measurements, SC drug concentration-depth profiles were reproducibly determined and fitted mathematically to obtain a partition coefficient, a first-order rate constant related to ibuprofen diffusivity, and the total drug amount in the SC at the end of the application. All derived parameters were consistent across formulations. Ibuprofen permeation data through both silicone membrane and pig ear skin were also fitted to yield partitioning and diffusion parameters. The former revealed that ibuprofen partitioned differently from the gels into this model barrier. Across pig skin, however, better correlation with in vivo results was found. The dermatopharmacokinetic approach, using SC tape-stripping, offers a valid method to assess equivalency between topical drug formulations.

TRPA1 is activated by exogenous irritants and also by oxidants formed in inflammatory reactions. However, our understanding of its role in inflammation is limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TRPA1 is involved in acute inflammatory edema. The TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced inflammatory edema when injected intraplantarly to mice, mimicking the classical response to carrageenan. Interestingly, the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 and the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen inhibited not only AITC but also carrageenan-induced edema. TRPA1-deficient mice displayed attenuated responses to carrageenan and AITC. Furthermore, AITC enhanced COX-2 expression in HEK293 cells transfected with human TRPA1, a response that was reversed by HC-030031.

However, NSAIDs often cause several serious liver injuries, such as drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and the molecular mechanisms of DILI have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we developed a systems pharmacology approach to explore the mechanism-of-action of NSAIDs. We found that the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) antagonism of NSAIDs is a potential molecular mechanism of DILI through systematic network analysis and in vitro assays. Specially, the quantitative real-time PCR assay reveals that indomethacin and ibuprofen regulate FXR downstream target gene expression in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the western blot shows that FXR antagonism by indomethacin induces the phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), promotes the activation of caspase9, and finally causes DILI. In summary, our systems pharmacology approach provided novel insights into molecular mechanisms of DILI for NSAIDs, which may propel the ways toward the design of novel anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapeutics.",2015,,"Lu W, Cheng F, Jiang J, Zhang C, Deng X, Xu Z, Zou S, Shen X, Tang Y, Huang J.",https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08114.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

But the recently reported NAAA inhibitors suffer from the chemical and biological unstable properties, which restrict functions of NAAA inhibition in vivo. It is still unrevealed whether systematic inhibition of NAAA could modulate PEA-mediated pain signalings. Here we reported an oxazolidinone imide compound 3-(6-phenylhexanoyl) oxazolidin-2-one (F96), which potently and selectively inhibited NAAA activity (IC50 = 270 nM).

The effect of sample flow rate, acceptor flow rate, type of acceptor flow (continuous, semi-continuous or forward-backward), type of supported liquid membrane and sample volume was studied. The extraction of the final method was linear over an environmentally relevant concentration range and yielded high enrichment factors (720-940 times) in reagent water and (270-800 times) in sewage water for all analytes within 45 min. Repeatability was best (RSD 6-15%) during the first 30 min of extraction. The optimised method was used to monitor the occurrence and fate of the four NSAIDs in a Swedish sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent, which is discharged into a system of ponds before release into a river, during the period May-September 2008. All four analytes were detected at concentrations up to 0.92 µg L-1 ketoprofen, 0.08 µg L-1 naproxen, 0.43 µg L-1 diclofenac and 0.25 µg L-1 ibuprofen. A concentration drop during the summer was observed. For diclofenac and ketoprofen significant removal in the primary recipient pond system was observed.

Here, we propose a simple, fast and bio-friendly press-molding method for the preparation of cutaneous patches based on composites made from the drug nanocarrier MIL-100(Fe) and biopolymers. The physicochemical properties of the patches (structure, hydration, bioadhesive and swelling properties), as well as their encapsulation and release capabilities (both in ex vitro and ex vivo models), were evaluated using active ingredients such as the challenging cosmetic liporeductor, caffeine, and the model analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen. In particular, very high caffeine loadings were entrapped within these cutaneous devices with progressive releases under simulated cutaneous physiological conditions as a consequence of the swelling of the hydrophilic patches. Despite the absence of any cutaneous bioadhesive character, these patches provided progressive and suitable permeation of their cosmetic cargo through the skin, interestingly reaching the targeted adipose tissue.

To overcome these limitations, we used molecular design to create therapeutic methacrylic (TMA) monomers to impart tunable mechanical properties, decreased formaldehyde release, and covalently-controlled bioactivity to commercial cyanoacrylate adhesives. The small molecule therapeutics ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and benzocaine were covalently tethered to the carbonyl of methacrylate using anhydride, ester, and amide bonds. When these TMAs were incorporated into n-butyl cyanoacrylate (BCA) tissue adhesives, the resulting TMA-BCA materials provided release of the therapeutics across a range of time scales according to the reactivity of the tether bond to hydrolysis. The anhydride-tether TMA-BCA adhesive delivered ibuprofen on the same order of magnitude and time scale as topical medications (12 ± 6 mg per g adhesive after 3.4 h). TMA-BCA adhesives also produced less formaldehyde than standard BCA adhesive, showed promising cytocompatibility, and adhered effectively to porcine skin. Further, the anhydride, ester, and amide tether TMA-BCA adhesives exhibited a range of shear moduli, with those containing rigid aromatic amide groups being stiffer, and those with flexible alkyl segments being less stiff, which could enable these adhesives to be tailored to match the mechanical properties of target tissues. The amide-tether TMA-BCA adhesive also showed a 219% increase in toughness compared to BCA.

Remarkably, in 3D spheroid cancer cell cultures, some triple action compounds showed an antitumor potency up to 50-fold higher than cisplatin against a KRAS mutated pancreatic cancer cell line (PSN-1 cells). Standard biochemical assays classically employed to explore structure activity relationships of platinum drugs, such as cellular uptake and binding to potential biological targets (DNA, HDAC, mitochondria, and COX), do not provide linear correlations with the overall cytotoxicity data.

However, such measurements need to be linked to effect-based assays to identify risks. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) forms part of a chemical's environmental risk assessment (ERA), and current regulatory testing guidelines to calculate fish BCFs use hundreds of fish per chemical. Due to ethical concerns a reduction in the numbers of animals used is desired, and there is a need to identify in vitro or in silico alternatives which meet regulatory acceptance. This study describes the successful demonstration of a FIsh Gill Cell culture System (FIGCS) to assess an often overlooked parameter in pharmacokinetics: the excretion of drugs across the gill. The FIGCS tolerates the application of natural waters on its apical surface, mimicking the situation of the live fish, and thus in combination with advanced analytical methods, offers an opportunity to take lab-based testing used for ERA, such as compound uptake, biotransformation or excretion directly into field for validation with natural waters. Here we used the basic drug propranolol and the acidic ibuprofen as a demonstration of the FIGCS utility in three separate experiments. Excretion across the apical membrane showed saturation kinetics, suggesting the involvement of carrier-mediated processes. Both propranolol and ibuprofen were excreted across the epithelium from the media (internal blood equivalent) to the water, with ibuprofen excretion being considerably slower than propranolol excretion. Further studies indicate that ibuprofen may be complexing with fetal bovine serum (FBS) reducing bioavailability; in contrast propranolol efflux rate was unaffected, indicating that drugs behave differently in the presence of FBS and other plasma proteins.

The drug was loaded into the BC by immersing the partially swollen BC in a solution of drug concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> and then drying by two different methods: air-drying and freeze-drying. The results showed that the type of drug and the drying method influenced the drug loading efficiency and drug release behavior. For ibuprofen, high drug loading efficiency was found when loading the drug into BC at low concentration and <i>vice versa</i> for propranolol hydrochloride. The drug-loaded BC prepared by the freeze-drying method showed a sustained release regardless of drug type and drug-loaded amount. The sustained release followed the Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. On the other hand, when using the air-drying method, BC loaded with ibuprofen showed immediate release at every drug-loaded amount. However, BC loaded with propranolol hydrochloride showed immediate release at the high drug-loaded amount but showed sustained release at the low drug-loaded amount. The release of drug from a drug-loaded BC prepared by air-drying method tended to follow first-order kinetics. In conclusion, the drug loading concentration and the drying method in the drug-loaded BC preparation influenced the drug release characteristics of the BC-based drug delivery system.",2021,,"Jantarat C, Muenraya P, Srivaro S, Nawakitrangsan A, Promsornpason K.",https://doi.org/10.1039/d1ra07761a,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study, we found that lysine-161 in human serum albumin is a covalent binding site and could spontaneously bind a ketone skeleton quinoxaline-coumarin fluorescent dye with a specific turn-on fluorescence signal for the first time. Supported by the abundant drug binding domains in human serum albumin, drugs such as ibuprofen, warfarin and clopidogrel could interact with the fluorescent dye labeled human serum albumin to feature a substantial enhancement in fluorescence intensity (6.6-fold for ibuprofen, 4.5-fold for warfarin and 5-fold for clopidogrel). The drug concentration dependent fluorescence intensity amplification realized real-time, <i>in situ</i> blood drug concentration monitoring in mice, utilizing ibuprofen as a model drug. The non-invasive method avoided continuous blood sample collection, which fundamentally causes suffering and consumption of experimental animals in the study of pharmacokinetics.

Simple coordination chemistry was employed to anchor two kinds of drugs namely isoniazid (IZ - anti-tuberculosis), various non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAIDs) namely ibuprofen-IBU, fenoprofen-FEN, naproxen-NAP, diclofenac-DIC and mefenamic acid-MEF and Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> to synthesize a series of 1D coordination polymers namely IZIBU, IZFEN, IZNAP, IZDIC and IZMEF which were structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD). The coordination polymers wherein both types of drugs were anchored to Zn(II) metal centers could easily be ground to nano-sized particles suitable for biological studies by hand grinding in a mortar and pestle. Zone inhibition studies revealed that all the coordination polymers possessed antibacterial properties against Gram positive, Gram negative and mycobacteria namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Detailed studies carried out on IZDIC employing flow cytometry and confocal microscopy under various staining conditions established that such antibacterial activity was due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as nitric oxide (NO) and also inhibition of mycolic acid leading to incomplete cell wall formation. It was also established that IZDIC could indeed inhibit the growth of M.tb within a mouse macrophage host cell namely RAW 264.7 thereby simulating the treatment of Tuberculosis (TB) under <i>in vitro</i> conditions. Scratch assay and cell cycle analysis on a human lung cancer cell line (A549) revealed its anti-cancer property, thereby indicating its potential as a multi-drug-delivery system. <i>In vivo</i> toxicity assessment (serum parameters, histopathology, and haemolysis) carried out on BALB/c mice showed that IZDIC was safe up to a concentration of 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.

It has been proposed that the presence of antibiotics at concentrations typically found in wastewater can impact the dynamics of bacterial populations and facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance. The efficiency of currently-used wastewater treatment technologies in eliminating pharmaceuticals is often insufficient, resulting in the release of low concentrations of these compounds into the environment. In this study, we addressed these challenges by evaluating how different influent ibuprofen (IBU) concentrations influenced the efficiency of a laboratory-scale, integrated constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) system seeded with <i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>, in terms of organic matter removal, electricity generation, and change of bacterial community structure compared to unplanted, sediment MFC (S-MFC) and abiotic S-MFC (AS-MFC). We observed that the addition of IBU (5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) resulted in a notable decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and electricity generation, suggesting that high influent IBU concentrations caused partial inhibition for the electroactive microbial community due to its complexity and aromaticity. However, CW-MFC could recover from IBU inhibition after an acclimation period compared to unplanted S-MFC, even though the influent IBU level was increased up to 20 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting that plants in CW-MFCs have a beneficial role in relieving the inhibition of anode respiration due to the presence of high levels of IBU; thus, promoting the metabolic activity of the electroactive microbial community. Similarly, IBU removal efficiency for CW-MFC (<i>i.e.</i>, 49-62%) was much higher compared to SMFC (<i>i.e.</i>, 29-42%), and AS-MFC (<i>i.e.</i>, 20-22%) during all experimental phases. In addition, our high throughput sequencing revealed that the high performance of CW-MFCs compared to S-MFC was associated with increasing the relative abundances of several microbial groups that are closely affiliated with anode respiration and organic matter fermentation. In summary, our results show that the CW-MFC system demonstrates suitability for high removal efficiency of IBU and effective electricity generation.",2023,,"Youssef YA, Abuarab ME, Mahrous A, Mahmoud M.",https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ra05729a,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although the literature is more focused on COX-2 selectivity, sufficient or improved COX-1/COX-2 selectivity has garnered significant attention recently since it can ensure cardiovascular safety. Herein, in this regard, novel derivatives of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs containing amide, thiourea, thiosemicarbazide, and triazole functionalities were synthesized and characterized. Calculations on the <i>in silico</i> drug-likeness and toxicological properties demonstrated the suitability of the compounds for oral administration.

Ibuprofen (IBU) is a potent pain killer which is commonly co-prescribed with PIP and TAZ postoperatively. The combination therapy of PIP, TAZ, and IBU has been administered commonly after surgical procedures to combat aerobic and anaerobic microbes and exert anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. This study describes, for the first time, the development of a new capillary electrophoresis (CE) method with a photodiode array detector for the simultaneous determination of PIP, TAZ, and IBU in plasma samples. The experimental factors affecting the elution of analytes were carefully optimized. The final analysis was achieved using a fused silica capillary (58 cm effective length and 75 μm ID) and a background electrolyte solution containing a methanol/borax buffer solution (15 mM and pH 9.3) in a ratio of (10 : 90 v/v) with a driving voltage of 30 kV and detection at 210 nm. The relationship between the peak area and concentration was linear from 1 to 200 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> for both PIP and TAZ and from 3 to 200 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> for TAZ. The method used was thoroughly validated in accordance with the validation requirements set out by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bio-analytical processes. The proposed CE method was employed to conduct pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies of the drugs in rat models. The pharmacokinetic results revealed that there is a significant impact upon prescribing this combination concurrently when compared to their single administration. To illustrate, the time required to reach their maximum concentrations (<i>T</i> <sub>max</sub>) was increased by 0.25 h for both PIP and TAZ, whereas it was increased by 0.5 for IBU. When it comes to their maximum concentration (<i>C</i> <sub>max</sub>), it was increased by 13.7%, 55.5%, and 44% for PIP, TAZ, and IBU, respectively. Furthermore, the bioavailabilities of PIP, TAZ, and IBU were significantly increased by 55.4%, 19.7%, and 35.6%, respectively.

Yet, modern wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) do not remove them sufficiently to alleviate these risks. The present study aimed therefore to explore the effectiveness of an alternative nature-based tertiary treatment of WWTP effluent to remove psychopharmaceuticals. To this end, an algae-mussel trophic cascade setup was designed in which algae were grown in effluent over the course of 11 days and subsequently fed to mussels for a further 3 days. Removal of 30 psychopharmaceuticals for each of the treatments (algae, mussels, algae + mussels) was calculated relative to control samples, and removal efficiency was contextualised by performing an indicative risk assessment. Twelve psychopharmaceuticals were quantified during the experiment, with 11 encountered in all treatments. The compounds fell into 3 categories: positive removal (citalopram, lamotrigine, and venlafaxine), negative removal (carbamazepine, gabapentin, and pregabalin), and no significant changes in concentration (amitriptyline, quetiapine, tramadol, fluvoxamine, lidocaine, and ibuprofen). Both positive and negative removals were largely driven by the presence of the algae rather than that of the mussels. Compounds with a low p<i>K</i> <sub>a</sub> showed negative removal due to the algal growth induced rise in pH, which was not negated by the mussels at the end of the cascade. Ibuprofen was not removed by any treatment and was also the only compound that represented a substantial risk. The cumulative risks indicated that the algal-mussel cascade actually increased the risk due to the negative removal of compounds present in high concentrations such as carbamazepine. Pregabalin and gabapentin also increased in risk, but did, however, not significantly change the overall risk from the analysed compounds due to their low concentrations.

Incorporating the non-natural amino acid ornithine as a spacer was done to improve the aqueous solubility of the NSAID-peptide conjugates. The antibacterial activity of the conjugated peptides was evaluated, and these peptides showed significant activity against <i>E. coli</i> strain ATCC 25922, with MIC values of 12 μM. Cytotoxicity was assessed in human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and human melanoma cells (A375), showing that the NSAID-conjugated peptides retained and even exhibited better anticancer activity compared to the palindromic peptide from which they were derived.

Three-dimensional scaffolds that can control the release of anti-inflammatory agents over time and space offer a promising approach to regulate the immune response while providing structural support during healing. In this study, we developed an electrospun biomimetic scaffold incorporating ibuprofen-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with an ultrasound-responsive alginate coating. Optimal parameters for safe and non-invasive ultrasound stimulation (<i>i.e.</i>, frequency, intensity, and duration) were identified to induce weakening of the interaction among the alginate chains, enabling on-demand drug release from the nanoparticles. <i>In vitro</i> studies with human macrophages confirmed the biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory efficacy of the nanoparticles at concentrations up to 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The results demonstrated that ultrasound stimulation further amplified the therapeutic effect even at very low concentrations (≥0.05 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) of the tested nanoparticle suspensions. The electrospinning process was optimised to produce nanoparticle-containing polyvinylidene fluoride nanofibers that are aligned and piezoelectric, mimicking the architecture and electroactivity of native tissues.

As part of our effort to understand the mechanism by which celecoxib mediates apoptosis in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, we investigated its effect on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Digital ratiometric imaging analysis indicates that exposure of PC-3 cells to celecoxib stimulates an immediate [Ca(2+)](i) rise in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Kinetic data show that this Ca(2+) signal arises from internal Ca(2+) release in conjunction with external Ca(2+) influx. Examinations of the biochemical mechanism responsible for this Ca(2+) mobilization indicate that celecoxib blocks endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-ATPases. Consequently, inhibition of this Ca(2+) reuptake mechanism results in Ca(2+) mobilization from ER stores followed by capacitative calcium entry, leading to [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. In view of the important role of Ca(2+) in apoptosis regulation, this Ca(2+) perturbation may represent part of the signalling mechanism that celecoxib uses to trigger rapid apoptotic death in cancer cells. This Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitory activity is highly specific for celecoxib, and is not noted with other COX inhibitors tested, including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, rofecoxib (Vioxx), DuP697 and NS398. Moreover, it is noteworthy that this activity is also observed in many other cell lines examined, including A7r5 smooth muscle cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells and Jurkat T cells. Consequently, this Ca(2+)-perturbing effect may provide a plausible link with the reported toxicities of celecoxib such as increased cardiovascular risks in long-term anti-inflammatory therapy.",2002,,"Johnson AJ, Hsu AL, Lin HP, Song X, Chen CS.",http://www.biochemj.org/bj/366/0831/bj3660831.htm,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It has been shown that the NSAID sulindac induces apoptosis and suppresses carcinogenesis, in part, by a mechanism leading to the transcriptional activation of the gene encoding SSAT (spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase), a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism. In the present study, we show that a variety of NSAIDs, including aspirin, sulindac, ibuprofen and indomethacin, can induce SSAT gene expression in Caco-2 cells. Aspirin, at physiological concentrations, can induce SSAT mRNA via transcriptional initiation mechanisms. This induction leads to increased SSAT protein levels and enzyme activity. Promoter deletion analysis of the 5' SSAT promoter-flanking region led to the identification of two NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) response elements. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed binding of NF-kappaB complexes at these sequences after aspirin treatment. Aspirin treatment led to the activation of NF-kappaB signalling and increased binding at these NF-kappaB sites in the SSAT promoter, hence providing a potential mechanism for the induction of SSAT by aspirin in these cells. Aspirin-induced SSAT ultimately leads to a decrease in cellular polyamine content, which has been associated with decreased carcinogenesis. These results suggest that activation of SSAT by aspirin and different NSAIDs may be a common property of NSAIDs that plays an important role in their chemopreventive actions in colorectal cancer.",2006,,"Babbar N, Gerner EW, Casero RA.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1386030?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The purification procedure involved hydrophobic column chromatography using either Ibuprofen-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose or arachidic acid-Sepharose as the first step followed by metal-chelate Sepharose and haemin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme (Mr approximately 65,000) was homogeneous as observed by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The enzyme was a glycoprotein with mannose as the neutral sugar. Haemin or haemoglobin was essential for activity. The purified enzyme could bind haemin exhibiting a characteristic absorption maximum at 410 nm. The enzyme after metal-chelate column chromatography could undergo acetylation by [acetyl-3H]aspirin. The labelled acetylated enzyme could not bind to haemin-Sepharose, presumably due to acetylation of a serine residue involved in the binding to haemin.

These effects were accompanied by a transient stimulation of hepatic prostaglandin D2 and thromboxane B2 release. The Ca2+ release observed upon adenosine infusion (50 microM) was 23.5 +/- 5.2 nmol/g, i.e. 10-20% of the Ca2+ release observed with extracellular ATP (50 microM). Indomethacin (10 microM) prevented the adenosine-induced stimulation of glucose output and the increase in portal pressure by 79 and 63% respectively, and completely abolished the stimulation of prostaglandin D2 release. The thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist BM 13.177 (20 microM), the phospholipase A2 inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl bromide (20 microM) and the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (50 microM) also decreased the glycogenolytic and vasoconstrictive responses of the perfused rat liver upon adenosine infusion by 50-80%. When the indomethacin inhibition of adenosine-induced prostaglandin D2 release was titrated, a close correlation between prostaglandin D2 release and the metabolic and vascular responses to adenosine was observed. These findings suggest an important role for eicosanoids in mediating the nucleoside responses in the perfused rat liver. Since eicosanoids are known to be formed by non-parenchymal cells in rat liver [Decker (1985) Semin. Liver Dis. 5, 175-190], the present study gives further evidence for an important role of eicosanoids as signal molecules between the different liver cell populations.",1990,,"vom Dahl S, Wettstein M, Gerok W, Häussinger D.",https://doi.org/10.1042/bj2700039,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The responses were attenuated at low (approximately 7 microM) perfusate Ca2+, but were restored on re-addition of normal Ca2+ concentration. Co-infusion of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (50 microM) or of the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist WEB 2170 (1.2 microM) inhibited haemodynamic responses to BSA (5 micrograms/ml) by 48% and 59% respectively. Responses to BSA were also attenuated by prior infusion of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. Glycogen phosphorylase a activity was increased by 26% in livers freeze-clamped 2 min after onset of BSA infusion; tissue prostaglandin E2 content was increased at 2 min, but returned to control levels at 5 min.

MED,8393665,8393665,10.1042/bj2930573,Hepatocyte heterogeneity in response to extracellular adenosine.,"Metabolic and haemodynamic effects of adenosine were studied in antegrade and retrograde rat liver perfusions with influent nucleoside concentrations either below (i.e. 20 microM) or exceeding (i.e. 200-300 microM) the single-pass clearance capacity of the liver. Adenosine (20 microM) increased in antegrade perfusions the perfusion pressure and markedly stimulated prostaglandin D2, thromboxane B2 and glucose output, whereas in retrograde perfusions no pressure and eicosanoid response occurred and glucose output was stimulated only slightly. The perfusion-direction-dependent differences in the glucose and pressure response to adenosine (20 microM) were fully abolished in presence of ibuprofen (50 microM). When the adenosine concentration in influent was raised to 200-300 microM, i.e. to a concentration exceeding single-pass clearance of the nucleoside, the adenosine-induced prostaglandin D2 release was about 10-fold higher in retrograde perfusions than in antegrade perfusions. On the other hand, both adenosine (20-300 microM)-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) and K+ release from the liver were not affected by the direction of perfusion, and maximal effects on cAMP release were observed at influent adenosine concentrations of 100 microM. The basal rate (adenosine absent) of prostaglandin D2 and thromboxane B2 release was about 10-fold higher in retrograde than in antegrade perfusion experiments, whereas the basal cAMP release from the liver was not affected by the direction of perfusion. Maximal adenosine-stimulated glucose output was significantly higher in antegrade than in retrograde perfusions at all adenosine concentrations tested (range 10-300 microM). Ibuprofen abolished this difference, indicating that eicosanoids liberated under the influence of adenosine contribute to the glycogenolytic response in antegrade, but not in retrograde, perfusion. Desensitization occurred following repetitive adenosine infusion; this was more pronounced for adenosine-induced prostaglandin release than for cAMP or K+ efflux. The data suggest the following. (i) Both cAMP and eicosanoids are involved in the stimulation of glycogenolysis by adenosine. (ii) Eicosanoids are probably liberated under the influence of extracellular adenosine from a portal pre-sinusoidal compartment and accordingly stimulate glycogenolysis only in antegrade perfusions. Thus signals derived from portal vein structures can modulate hepatocellular function. (iii) Contractile elements are probably located also inside the liver acinus. (iv) Eicosanoids released into the hepatic vein reflect less than 10% of hepatic eicosanoid formation, because of marked clearance by perivenous hepatocytes.",1993,,"Morimoto Y, Wettstein M, Häussinger D.",https://doi.org/10.1042/bj2930573,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Using the Hospital Discharge Register, all hospitalizations for UGIBs were identified among the 156,138 users of NSAIDs and compared with the number of expected based on the North Jutland population who did not receive NSAID prescriptions.<h4>Results</h4>During periods of NSAID use without use of other drugs associated with UGIB, we observed 365 UGIBs, a number 3.6 times higher than expected (95% CI = 3.3, 4.0). The excess risk varied by sex, type of NSAID and form and route of administration of the NSAID, but not by age at first NSAID prescription or number of prior prescriptions. Risk declined sharply following cessation of use. For ibuprofen and naproxen, there was a clear trend in rising risk by increasing dose, although the lowest doses were also associated with an excess of UGIB. Concurrent use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants and aspirin further increased the risk of UGIB.<h4>Conclusions</h4>All types and formulations of NSAIDs appear to increase the risk of UGIBs, but the effect appear not to be cumulative and diminish rapidly with discontinue of use.

Inhibition of blood COX isoenzymes was determined in vitro before any drug intake and ex vivo after single and repeated intake of either 7.5 mg meloxicam once, 400 mg ibuprofen three times daily or 75 mg diclofenac SR once, taken in a randomized cross-over design. Production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) during clotting and of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during endotoxin exposure served as indicators of platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 activity, respectively. Drugs were determined in plasma by h.p.l.c., with a chiral separation of ibuprofen and free fractions after equilibrium dialysis.<h4>Results</h4>Intra-subject variation for COX-1 and COX-2 at baseline was at 26 +/- 18% and 18 +/- 13% respectively, and intersubject variation at 39% and 36%, respectively. The ratios of IC50s and, at best, of IC80s revealed diclofenac and meloxicam as selective COX-2 inhibitors and ibuprofen as a preferential COX-1 inhibitor in vitro. However, after oral intake, ibuprofen inhibited ex vivo COX-2 by 80% whereas diclofenac inhibited COX-1 by 70%. Meloxicam inhibited COX-1 from 30 to 55% depending on the repetition of the dose and increase in plasma concentrations. Using in vitro dose--response curves, the in vivo inhibitory potency of diclofenac was estimated adequately from its circulating concentration ([-0.18, 0.21] for COX-1 and [-0.13, -0.03] for COX-2) but this was not the case for ibuprofen on COX-2 ([-0.14, 0.27]) and meloxicam on COX-1 ([0.31, 1.05]). The limited predictability of the system was not improved through considering the unbound fraction of the drugs or the variable chiral inversion of ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Assessment of COX-2 selectivity based on in vitro studies and pharmacological modelling has a limited clinical relevance.

A small skin area of the proximal upper leg was irradiated with a UVB source using three times the individually estimated minimal erythema dose. Twenty hours after irradiation skin temperature, heat pain threshold and tolerance in sunburn spot were measured using a thermal sensory testing.

Furthermore, in vivo studies were performed. The permeation studies utilizing static Franz diffusion cells allow the determination of the transdermal (systemic) transport, whereas the penetration studies in vitro (according to the Saarbrücker model) and in vivo permit setting up a concentration-depth profile. For this purpose the permeation kinetics of ketoprofen from three different gels (each containing 2.5% ketoprofen) over a period of two days were determined at heat-separated human skin of different donors. The in vitro permeability coefficients for Test-D (6.50 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)) and Ref-I (5.72 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)) were comparable and the transport occurred for both by a factor of 8-9 faster than with Ref-E (0.78 x 10(-7) cm x s(-1)). In parallel to the permeation studies with ketoprofen, the permeability coefficient of caffeine from an ointment was assessed using the skin biopsies of the same donors as a quality assurance. In a second part of the studies, the in vitro penetration of ketoprofen from Test-D was determined over a period of 3 h at three different skin biopsies in comparison to a commercially available 5% ibuprofen gel (Ref-D). As a main result a concentration-depth profile for ketoprofen and ibuprofen could be issued.

All antidepressants increased the serotonin release from rat platelets. NGF release was reduced by sertraline, paroxetine and ibuprofen, but only when calcium was present, except for sertraline after 10 min.

In this study, the combination of attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopic imaging with specifically designed polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices to study drug release from pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. First, the high-throughput analysis of the dissolution of micro-formulations studied under flowing conditions has been introduced using a model formulation of ibuprofen and polyethylene glycol. The behaviour and release of the drug was monitored in situ under different pH conditions. In contrast to the neutral solution, where both the drug and excipient dissolved at a similar rate, structural change from the molecularly dispersed to a crystalline form of ibuprofen was characterised in the obtained spectroscopic images and the corresponding ATR-FTIR spectra for the experiments carried out in the acidic medium. Further investigations into the behaviour of the drug after its release from formulations (i.e., dissolved drug) were also undertaken. Different solutions of sodium ibuprofen dissolved in a neutral medium were studied upon contact with acidic conditions. The phase transition from a dissolved species of sodium ibuprofen to the formation of solid crystalline ibuprofen was revealed in the microfluidic channels. This innovative approach could offer a promising platform for high-throughput analysis of a range of micro-formulations, which are of current interest due to the advent of 3D printed pharmaceutical and microparticulate delivery systems.

It is generally believed that COX-1 is constitutively expressed, whereas COX-2 is primarily inducible during inflammation. This study examined the in vivo selectivity of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, and evaluated whether estimates of selectivity that are based on in vitro and ex vivo analyses are reliable indicators of in vivo selectivity.<h4>Methods</h4>Subjects (103 outpatients undergoing surgical removal of two impacted mandibular third molars) received either 200 mg celecoxib, 600 mg ibuprofen, or placebo 8 hours before surgery and a second dose 1 hour before surgery. After surgery, microdialysis probes were placed in the surgical sites for collection of inflammatory transudate. Samples were collected every 20 minutes and pain intensity was estimated concurrently with a visual analog scale and a categorical rating scale for up to 4 hours after surgery.<h4>Results</h4>A significant analgesic effect (P <.01, compared with placebo) was shown for both drugs, with the efficacy of celecoxib being intermediate between ibuprofen and placebo.

SMCT, the product of the SLC5A8 gene, is 70% similar to the Na(+)/I(-) symporter, the protein that mediates active I(-) uptake in the basolateral surface of thyrocytes and other cells. SMCT was reported in the apical surface of thyrocytes and formerly proposed also to transport I(-) and was called the apical I(-) transporter. However, it is now clear that SMCT does not transport I(-). Here we demonstrate a high-affinity Na(+)-dependent monocarboxylate transport system in thyroid cells, which is likely to be SMCT. We show that, whereas thyroidal Na(+)/I(-) symporter expression is thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-dependent and basolateral, SMCT expression is TSH-independent and apical not only in the thyroid but also in kidney and colon epithelial cells and in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We determine the kinetic parameters of SMCT activity and show its inhibition by ibuprofen (K(i) = 73 +/- 9 microM) in Xenopus laevis oocytes. SMCT was proposed to be a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. Significantly, we show that higher expression of SMCT in colon samples from 113 colorectal cancer patients correlates with longer disease-free survival, suggesting that SMCT expression may be a favorable indicator of colorectal cancer prognosis.",2006,,"Paroder V, Spencer SR, Paroder M, Arango D, Schwartz S, Mariadason JM, Augenlicht LH, Eskandari S, Carrasco N.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0602365103,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Fluorogenic substrates allow for direct measurement of enzyme activity in situ; however, in contrast to proteases and exo-glycosidases, there are no simple guidelines for the design of selective probes for redox metabolic enzymes. Here, we introduce redox probe 1 and demonstrate its high selectivity in living cells for human hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. AKR1C isoforms perform multiple functions among which the metabolism of potent steroid hormones is well documented. Moreover, expression of these enzymes is responsive to cellular stress and pathogenesis, including cancer. Our probe design is based on redox-sensitive optical switches, which couple a ketone-alcohol redox event to a profound change in fluorescence. The high selectivity of phenyl ketone 1 for AKR1C2 over the many endogenous reductases present in mammalian cells was established by a quantitative comparison of the metabolic rates between null control cells (COS-1) and AKR1C2-transfected cells. Phenyl ketone 1 is a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe that permits a direct, real-time, and operationally simple readout of AKR1C2 enzyme activity in intact mammalian cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that probe 1 enables the quantitative examination of physiological substrate 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (""dark substrate"") in situ by means of a two-substrate competitive assay. Similarly, inhibitor potency of physiological (ursodeoxycholate) and synthetic inhibitors (flufenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen) was also readily evaluated.",2006,,"Yee DJ, Balsanek V, Bauman DR, Penning TM, Sames D.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1569159?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, clinical studies have shown that the Cox-2 selective drugs (or coxibs) rofecoxib and etoricoxib, at therapeutic doses, do not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, in contrast to ibuprofen. Here, we have evaluated the relative potential of ibuprofen and various coxibs to interfere with the inactivation of Cox-1 by aspirin by using purified enzyme and calcium ionophore-activated human platelets. The irreversible inactivation of Cox-1 by aspirin can be antagonized by ibuprofen and coxibs, albeit with widely different potencies. The rank order of potencies for this process (ibuprofen > celecoxib > valdecoxib > rofecoxib > etoricoxib) parallels that obtained for the inhibition of Cox-1-mediated thromboxane B(2) production by calcium ionophore-stimulated platelets. The antagonism of aspirin therefore likely involves a competition at the enzyme active site. The EC(50) value for the antagonism against 10 microM aspirin for each drug is approximately 10- to 40-fold lower than the corresponding IC(50) value for inhibition of platelet Cox-1 activity, consistent with the much weaker initial binding of aspirin to Cox-1 as compared with arachidonic acid.

This time-dependent conversion of the adrenergic receptor response from alpha 1 to beta type is prevented by the presence in the incubation medium of 0.5% fatty-acid-free, but not regular, bovine serum albumin. A 20-min exposure of freshly isolated liver cells to arachidonic acid (10 micrograms/ml), but not to stearic or palmitic acid, causes an acute shift in the receptor response from alpha 1 to mixed alpha 1/beta type, similar in direction to that seen after prolonged incubation of the cells. This effect of arachidonic acid is prevented by 0.2 microM ibuprofen but not by the same concentration of nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Ibuprofen (1 microM) or indomethacin (1 microM) also inhibits the time-dependent shift in the receptor response. Actinomycin D inhibits the change in receptor response that is caused by prolonged incubation but not the change that is caused by exogenous arachidonic acid. It is proposed that the time-dependent conversion from alpha 1- to beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated glycogenolysis in isolated rat liver cells is related to a parallel increase in the phospholipase-mediated release of arachidonic acid and the subsequent formation of a key cyclooxygenase metabolite. A protein factor appears to be involved in the regulation of the release of arachidonic acid but not in the action of its metabolite. A possible mechanism by which this metabolite may regulate inverse changes in the coupling of alpha 1- and beta-receptors to postreceptor pathways is discussed.",1986,,"Ishac EJ, Kunos G.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.83.1.53,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Therefore, we have assessed the relative inhibitory effects of some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on the activities of COX-1 (in bovine aortic endothelial cells) and COX-2 (in endotoxin-activated J774.2 macrophages) in intact cells, broken cells, and purified enzyme preparations (COX-1 in sheep seminal vesicles; COX-2 in sheep placenta). Similar potencies of aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen against the broken cell and purified enzyme preparations indicated no influence of species. Aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen were more potent inhibitors of COX-1 than COX-2 in all models used. The relative potencies of aspirin and indomethacin varied only slightly between models, although the IC50 values were different. Ibuprofen was more potent as an inhibitor of COX-2 in intact cells than in either broken cells or purified enzymes. Sodium salicylate was a weak inhibitor of both COX isoforms in intact cells and was inactive against COX in either broken cells or purified enzyme preparations. Diclofenac, BW 755C, acetaminophen, and naproxen were approximately equipotent inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2 in intact cells. BF 389, an experimental drug currently being tested in humans, was the most potent and most selective inhibitor of COX-2 in intact cells. Thus, there are clear pharmacological differences between the two enzymes. The use of such models of COX-1 and COX-2 activity will lead to the identification of selective inhibitors of COX-2 with presumably less side effects than present therapies. Some inhibitors had higher activity in intact cells than against purified enzymes, suggesting that pure enzyme preparations may not be predictive of therapeutic action.",1993,,"Mitchell JA, Akarasereenont P, Thiemermann C, Flower RJ, Vane JR.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.90.24.11693,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To examine selectivity of tolerated doses of an inhibitor of the inducible COX-2 in humans, we examined the effects of celecoxib on indices of COX-1-dependent platelet thromboxane (Tx) A2 and on systemic biosynthesis of prostacyclin in vivo. Volunteers received doses of 100, 400, or 800 mg of celecoxib or 800 mg of a nonselective inhibitor, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen, but not celecoxib, significantly inhibited TxA2-dependent aggregation, induced ex vivo by arachidonic acid (83 +/- 11% vs. 11. 9 +/- 2.2%; P < 0.005) and by collagen. Neither agent altered aggregation induced by thromboxane mimetic, U46619. Ibuprofen reduced serum TxB2 (-95 +/- 2% vs. -6.9 +/- 4.2%; P < 0.001) and urinary excretion of the major Tx metabolite, 11-dehydro TxB2 (-70 +/- 9.9% vs. -20.3 +/- 5.3%; P < 0.05) when compared with placebo. Despite a failure to suppress TxA2-dependant platelet aggregation, celecoxib had a modest but significant inhibitory effect on serum TxB2 4 hr after dosing. By contrast, both ibuprofen and celecoxib suppressed a biochemical index of COX-2 activity (endotoxin induced PGE2 in whole blood ex vivo) to a comparable degree (-93.3 +/- 2% vs. -83 +/- 6.1%). There was no significant difference between the doses of celecoxib on COX-2 inhibition. Celecoxib and ibuprofen suppressed urinary excretion of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1alpha. These data suggest that (i) platelet COX-1-dependent aggregation is not inhibited by up to 800 mg of celecoxib; (ii) comparable COX-2 inhibition is attained by celecoxib (100-800 mg) and ibuprofen (800 mg) after acute dosing; and (iii) COX-2 is a major source of systemic prostacyclin biosynthesis in healthy humans.",1999,,"McAdam BF, Catella-Lawson F, Mardini IA, Kapoor S, Lawson JA, FitzGerald GA.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.1.272,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

COX-2 is induced during inflammation and is overexpressed in colon cancer. In vitro, an 18-amino acid segment, residues 595-612, immediately upstream of the C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence is required for N-glycosylation of Asn(594), which permits COX-2 protein to enter the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation system. To determine the importance of this COX-2 degradation pathway in vivo, we engineered a del595-612 PGHS-2 (Delta 18 COX-2) knock-in mouse lacking this 18-amino acid segment. Delta 18 COX-2 knock-in mice do not exhibit the renal or reproductive abnormalities of COX-2 null mice. Delta 18 COX-2 mice do have elevated urinary prostaglandin E(2) metabolite levels and display a more pronounced and prolonged bacterial endotoxin-induced febrile response than wild type (WT) mice. Normal brain tissue, cultured resident peritoneal macrophages, and cultured skin fibroblasts from Delta 18 COX-2 mice overexpress Delta 18 COX-2 relative to WT COX-2 expression in control mice. These results indicate that COX-2 can be degraded via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway in vivo. Treatment of cultured cells from WT or Delta 18 COX-2 mice with flurbiprofen, which blocks substrate-dependent degradation, attenuates COX-2 degradation, and treatment of normal mice with ibuprofen increases the levels of COX-2 in brain tissue. Thus, substrate turnover-dependent COX-2 degradation appears to contribute to COX-2 degradation in vivo. Curiously, WT and Delta 18 COX-2 protein levels are similar in kidneys and spleens from WT and Delta 18 COX-2 mice.

Salicylate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit VSMC proliferation by an unknown mechanism unrelated to anti-inflammatory activity. In search for this mechanism, we have studied the effects of salicylate and other NSAIDs on subcellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and Ca(2+)-dependent cell proliferation in rat aortic A10 cells, a model of neointimal VSMCs. We found that A10 cells displayed both store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) and voltage-operated Ca(2+) entry (VOCE), the former being more important quantitatively than the latter. Inhibition of SOCE by specific Ca(2+) released-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC/Orai) channels antagonists prevented A10 cell proliferation. Salicylate and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac, inhibited SOCE and thereby Ca(2+)-dependent, A10 cell proliferation. SOCE, but not VOCE, induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in A10 cells, and mitochondrial depolarization prevented SOCE, thus suggesting that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake controls SOCE (but not VOCE) in A10 cells. NSAIDs depolarized mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, suggesting that they favor the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of CRAC/Orai channels. NSAIDs also inhibited SOCE in rat basophilic leukemia cells where mitochondrial control of CRAC/Orai is well established. NSAIDs accelerate slow inactivation of CRAC currents in rat basophilic leukemia cells under weak Ca(2+) buffering conditions but not in strong Ca(2+) buffer, thus excluding that NSAIDs inhibit SOCE directly. Taken together, our results indicate that NSAIDs inhibit VSMC proliferation by facilitating the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of CRAC/Orai channels which normally is prevented by mitochondria clearing of entering Ca(2+).",2011,,"Muñoz E, Valero RA, Quintana A, Hoth M, Núñez L, Villalobos C.",http://www.jbc.org/article/S0021925820514361/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In contrast, the slow, time-dependent COX inhibitors (diclofenac, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen) were unaffected by those mutations. Further mutagenesis studies suggested that mutation at position 89 was principally responsible for the changes in inhibitory potency of rapid, reversible inhibitors, whereas mutation at position 90 may exert some effect on the potency of COX-2-selective diarylheterocycle inhibitors; no effect was observed with mutation at position 119. Several crystal structures with or without NSAIDs indicated that placement of a bulky residue at position 89 caused a closure of a gap at the lobby, and alteration of histidine to tryptophan at position 90 changed the electrostatic profile of the side pocket of COX-2.

In contrast to gamma-secretase inhibitors, Abeta42-lowering NSAIDs do not impair S3 cleavage in the NOTCH receptor and release of the NOTCH intracellular domain, a finding with conceptual implications for the development of safer drugs targeting Abeta production through gamma-secretase modulation. Intramembrane cleavage and release of an intracellular signaling domain has recently been demonstrated in a number of additional gamma-secretase substrates. We now show in cell-based assays that intramembrane cleavage of APP and ErbB-4 receptor is not impaired by the Abeta42-lowering NSAIDs, sulindac sulfide and ibuprofen. Generation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) was further not inhibited in a cell-free assay at concentrations far exceeding those effective in reducing Abeta42 production. Closer inspection of AICD signaling showed that stabilization of the AICD peptide by FE65 and AICD-mediated transcription were also retained at Abeta42-lowering concentrations.

In vitro experiments using vesicles overexpressing MRP4 showed an ATP-dependent transport of MPAG driven by MRP4 (Michaelis-Menten constant of 233.9 ± 32.8 µM). MPA was not effluxed by MRP4. MRP4-mediated transport of MPAG was inhibited (from -43% to -84%) by ibuprofen, cefazolin, cefotaxime and micafungin.

In vitro drug-release kinetics obtained with Franz diffusion cell and dialysis membrane.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that when reaction temperature at 80 degrees C, weight percentage of stannous octoate as catalyst at 0.05%, ratio of NCO/OH at 2.0-2.2, ratio of PEG/polypropylene glycol (PPG)/polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG) at 30/25-30/50-55, and weight percentage of glycol as chain extender at 4.5%, PEGPU-PSAs synthesized performed well on adhesive properties. Actually, PEG on the main chain of the PU could improve the hydrophilicity of PSAs, whereas PPG and PTMG could offer proper adhesive properties. Skin compatibility test on volunteers indicated that PEG-PU-PSAs would not cause any skin irritations. All the model drugs had excellent stabilizations in PEG-PU-PSAs.

The in vivo skin penetration test of rats was carried out using Rhodamine B nanoemulsion to simulate the process of drug penetration into the skin, and the frozen section of the skin was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).<h4>Result</h4>FTIR spectra and DSC thermogram of rat skin treated with IBU nanoemulsion showed that infiltration occurred due to disruption of the stratum corneum (SC) protein-lipid structure and increasing of fluidity, hydration, and disruption of the lipid bilayer structure of the SC. The significant reduce in Ea (1.255 kcal/mol) for IBU permeating rat skin suggested crucial disruption of the SC lipid bilayers (P < 0.05), which is speculated that nanoemulsion may create new pathways to promote drug penetration.

Crude palm oil (CPO) is obtained by direct compression of the mesocarp of the fruit of the oil palm belonging to the genus Elaeis. In this research, CPO and tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) of palm oil were evaluated for the first time as skin permeation enhancers using full-thickness human skin. The in vitro permeation experiments were conducted using excised human skin mounted in static upright 'Franz-type' diffusion cells. The drugs selected to evaluate the enhancing effects of these palm oil derivatives were 5-fluorouracil, lidocaine and ibuprofen: compounds covering a wide range of Log p values. It was demonstrated that CPO and TRF were capable of enhancing the percutaneous permeation of drugs across full-thickness human skin in vitro.

The poloxamer gel with menthol/ibuprofen ratio of 1:9 and higher than 15% poloxamer 188 showed the maximum solubility of ibuprofen, 1.2 mg/ml. Menthol improved the dissolution rates of ibuprofen from poloxamer gels. Dissolution mechanism showed that the dissolution rate of ibuprofen from the poloxamer gels without menthol was independent of the time, but the drug might be dissolved from the poloxamer gels with menthol by Fickian diffusion. Thus, the poloxamer gels developed using eutectic mixture with menthol, which gave the improved solubility and dissolution of drug, are potential candidates for ibuprofen-loaded transdermal and rectal delivery system.",2003,,"Yong CS, Jung SH, Rhee JD, Choi HG, Lee BJ, Kim DC, Choi YW, Kim CK.",https://doi.org/10.1080/713840406,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Cataplasm was prepared by dispersing a model drug (ibuprofen), humectant (glycerol), adhesive (Indopol H100), polymer (Carbopol C934P) with other formulation ingredients in a beaker with an open-blade impeller. The paste was cast on a nonocclusive backing membrane and dried overnight. The diffusion of the model drug was studied across a cellulosic membrane using Franz's diffusion cells. The amounts of three formulation variables, carbopol (X1), glycerol (X2), and indopol (X3) were studied at three levels, and a face-centered cubic design was used to maximize the flux. An optimization procedure for maximum flux and minimum lag time predicted a flux of 97.22 mcg/cm2/hr at X1 (2% w/w), X2 (11.75% w/w), and X3 (6%, w/w).

With the diester pretreatment, drug permeation increased and the lag times decreased. No relationship was observed between the solubilities of the drugs in the diesters and the diester enhancement effects. The enhancement effect decreased with an increase of the drug lipophilicity, but increased with an increase of the lipophilic index of the diester up to about 3.5, after which the enhancement effect decreased or remained constant. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was employed to investigate the biophysical changes in the stratum corneum lipids caused by the diesters. The FTIR results showed that treatment of the skin with diesters did not produce a blue shift in the asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching peak positions. However, all of the above diesters showed a decrease in peak heights and areas for both asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching absorbances in comparison with water treatment. These results suggested that the diesters were more effective for enhancing the penetration of hydrophilic drugs than lipophilic drugs, and the enhancing effect of lipophilic diesters was more effective than that of hydrophilic diesters. The enhancement effects of diesters may be due to their causing lipid extraction in the skin.",2002,,"Takahashi K, Sakano H, Numata N, Kuroda S, Mizuno N.",https://doi.org/10.1081/ddc-120015362,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Different types of intestine parts of cattle, sheep, and pig were applied as biological flat sheet membranes after different modes of pretreatment. Best results were obtained with special parts of cattle appendix. The concentration of each drug in the aqueous feed phase was in the range of 0.1-10 mg (cm3)(-1), the pH-values adjusted between 8 and 10. Pure water was used as the permeation phase. The influence of experimental parameters such as stirring velocity, temperature, pH-value, salt concentration, and the presence of surfactants as well as humic substances was studied. Under all conditions chosen the combined drugs permeate simultaneously through the natural membranes as the permeation kinetics of the individual compounds are very similar, while humic compounds were retained. Additional treatment of the permeate with liquid or solid phase extraction techniques increases crucially the depletion of the drugs from the feed. The mass transfer of the pharmaceuticals through the liquid membranes was carried out in three-compartment transport cells and supported liquid membrane-chambers. The three-phase liquid bulk membrane systems consisted of an aqueous feed solution, an organic solvent (dihexyl ether, decane, undecane, or decanol) with and without a dissolved sulfonic acid, tertiary amine or Cu(II)-chelate compound as a liquid bulk membrane and an aqueous stripping solutions containing dilute solutiuons of Na2CO3, NaOH, HCl, or HClO4. The transport of the drugs shows some differences, which can be attributed to their acid/base-behavior and partition coefficients log Kow. High extraction yields were obtained for sulfamethoxazol and carbamazepine by using polar organic solvents. Maximum transport efficiencies were obtained for the acidic compounds ibuprofen and diclofenac. They were completely extracted by using dihexyl ether loaded with octane sulfonic acid. A pH-gradient between feed and strip increases the efficiency of the transport. Certain three-phase compositions were successfully utilized in supported liquid membrane systems (SLM) so that high enrichment factors (approximately 75) were achieved for traces of diclofenac and ibuprofen. The solid and liquid membrane systems employed aim for technical as well as analytical purposes, such as sample pretreatment prior to HPLC-UV or LC-MS analysis of drug traces.",2004,,"Grote M, Haciosmanoglu B, Bataineh M, Nolte J.",https://doi.org/10.1081/ese-120028412,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In the present study, application of three types of water-soluble additives, namely polyethylene glycols (PEG 400, 3350, and 8000), maltodextrins (Maltrin M150, M100, and M040 in the order of lower to higher average polymer size and molecular weight; dextrose equivalence 16.9, 11.1, and 4.8, respectively), and xylitol, as porosity modifiers in the films of a commercially available aqueous ethylcellulose dispersion (Surelease/E-7-7060 plasticized with glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate) was investigated. The effect of type and level of these additives on drug release characteristics and surface and mechanical properties of the polymeric films was studied. Each additive was incorporated at 20 and 30% levels in the polymeric dispersion based on its solids content. Ibuprofen tablets were coated using the polymeric dispersion with and without additive at 3% w/w coat level in a fluid-bed equipment. The coated tablets were evaluated for their drug release rate, coat reflectivity (gloss), Brinell hardness, and elastic modulus. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis of the films was performed to determine the physico-chemical changes in the applied film-coats. The rate of drug release, hence film porosity, was observed to be dependent on the type and level of the additive added. The molecular weight of the additive and its concentration in the polymeric dispersion had significant influence on the rate of drug release, hardness, and elasticity of the film-coats.",2002,,"Rohera BD, Parikh NH.",https://doi.org/10.1081/pdt-120015044,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Using menthol and aqueous isopropanol (IPA) as melting point depressing agents, the two-phase melt systems (TMSs) of Ibu consisting of a homogeneous oily phase and a homogeneous aqueous phase were obtained. In TMS with a high S-Ibu: menthol ratio and a low IPA content, the oily phase primarily consisted of Ibu and menthol, whereas the majority of the aqueous phase was IPA and buffer. Using this method, the S-Ibu concentration in the oily phase reached as high as 70% (w/w). The compositional phase diagram was obtained using a titration method to study the relationship between the melting states of the solid components and system composition. S- and RS-Ibu showed different phase diagrams, and the maximum concentration of S-Ibu measured in the oily phase of TMS was much greater than that of RS-Ibu. The permeation study of a series of TMS and non-TMS systems showed that S-Ibu penetrated through shed snake skin faster than RS-Ibu, and the contents of IPA and menthol significantly affected the permeation rates of ibuprofen across shed snake skin, which may be attributed to the higher lipophilicity, and thus, higher solubility of S-Ibu in the skin than RS-Ibu. Such results support the use of S-Ibu TMS for topical formulation development.",2004,,"Kang L, Park MO, Jun HW.",https://doi.org/10.1081/pdt-200032991,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The melting points of selected NSAIDs were significantly depressed due to binary eutectic formation with ibuprofen. Ketoprofen and ibuprofen were selected to study the effect of eutectic formation on membrane permeation using Franz diffusion cells and snake skin as the model membrane.

As much as the 99.6% of ibuprofen and the 88.8% of ketoprofen added were found in the oily phase of the two-phase liquid system formed when aqueous IPA was added to the eutectic mixture.

In contrast, the oxidative response was decreased and the IL-8 concentration was 227+/-36 pg/mL in cells from a patient with p47-phox deficiency, compared with 664+/-48 pg/mL in control cells.

Results from differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, and morphological observations demonstrated that ibuprofen was distributed in the ultrafine fibers in the form of nanosolid dispersions and the physical status of drug was an amorphous or molecular form, different from that of the pure drug and a physical mixture of PVP and ibuprofen. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results illustrated that the main interactions between PVP and ibuprofen were mediated through hydrogen bonding. Pharmacotechnical tests showed that FDMs with different drug contents had almost the same wetting and disintegrating times, about 15 and 8 s, respectively, but significantly different drug dissolution rates due to the different physical status of the drug and the different drug-release-controlled mechanisms. 84.9% and 58.7% of ibuprofen was released in the first 20 s for FDMs with a drug-to-PVP ratio of 1:4 and 1:2, respectively.

To solve these problems, we herein report an approach to functionalize electrospun membranes with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory components to modulate inflammatory responses and improve implantation outcomes. Specifically, electrospun polylactic acid (PLA)/gelatin (Gel) fibers were grafted with chitosan (CS) and ibuprofen (IBU) via carbodiimide chemistry. Our results show that the surface modification strategy endows electrospun membranes with moderate antibacterial activities and sustained release of anti-inflammatory drugs. The electrospun PLA/Gel-CS-IBU membrane showed good antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity as evidenced by suppressing M1 polarization and promoting M2 polarization of macrophages<i>in vitro</i>.

Moreover, CH-induced increased hypoxic sensitivity is blocked by concurrent treatment with the common anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen and dexamethasone. The present study examines the hypothesis that selected cytokines enhance the excitability of oxygen-sensitive type I cells in the carotid body, and that downstream effects of cytokines involve upregulation of the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Cultured type I cells were exposed for 24 h to hypoxia and/or a cocktail of cytokines consisting of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Subsequent evaluation of hypoxia-evoked intracellular Ca(2+)-responses showed that previous exposure to cytokines plus hypoxia resulted in a 110% (p<0.001) increase in cell excitability, whereas exposure to cytokines or hypoxia alone elicited smaller increases of 22% (not significant) and 35% (p<0.01), respectively. These changes were correlated with increased immunostaining for HIF-1α in similarly treated type I cells, where exposure to cytokines plus hypoxia promoted the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor. Moreover, treatment with cytokines and/or hypoxia elevated the expression of the HIF-1-regulated gene, adrenomedullin. These in vitro results are supported by studies which show that elevated type I cell sensitivity following in vivo CH is blocked by concurrent treatment with ibuprofen. The data suggest that CH-induced adaptation in arterial chemoreceptors may in part be mediated by cytokine/hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-1α, and consequent enhanced expression of specific hypoxia-sensitive genes in type I cells.",2013,,"Liu X, He L, Dinger B, Stensaas L, Fidone S.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3612280?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Unlike most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen suppresses basal RhoA activity (Zhou et al., 2003). A recent report suggested that ibuprofen promotes corticospinal axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (Fu et al., 2007). Here, we confirm that ibuprofen reduces ligand-induced Rho signaling and myelin-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth in vitro. Following 4 weeks of subcutaneous administration of ibuprofen, beginning 3 days after spinal cord contusion, animals recovered walking function to a greater degree, with twice as many rats achieving a hind limb weight-bearing status. We examined the relative role of tissue sparing, axonal sprouting, and axonal regeneration in the action of ibuprofen. Histologically, ibuprofen-treated animals display an increase in spared tissue without an alteration in astrocytic or microglial reaction. Ibuprofen increases axonal sprouting from serotonergic raphespinal axons, and from rostral corticospinal fibers in the injured spinal cord, but does not permit caudal corticospinal regeneration after spinal contusion. Treatment of mice with complete spinal cord transection demonstrates long-distance raphespinal axon regeneration in the presence of ibuprofen. Thus, administration of ibuprofen improves the recovery of rats from a clinically relevant spinal cord trauma by protecting tissue, stimulating axonal sprouting, and allowing a minor degree of raphespinal regeneration.",2009,,"Wang X, Budel S, Baughman K, Gould G, Song KH, Strittmatter SM.",https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2007.0464,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Investigations of compounds that may ameliorate neuronal cell death have largely used rodent models, which are time consuming, expensive, and cumbersome to perform. Previous studies had demonstrated that steroids, particularly dexamethasone and its analog methylprednisolone sodium succinate, exhibit limited neuroprotective effects against neuronal injury. Significantly, many naturally occurring nonsteroidal plant compounds exhibit structural overlap with steroids. In this report, we present an in vitro cellular screen model to practically examine the efficacy of various phytoestrogens in modulating the ibuprofen-induced expression of p75(NTR) and reduced cell survival of CCFSTTG1 and U87MG cells in a rescue (postinjury) or prevention (preinjury) regimen. We show that the phytoestrogen, biochanin A, and, to a lesser extent, genistein are more effective than dexamethasone at reducing p75(NTR) expression and improving the viability of U87MG and CCFSTTG1 before and after p75(NTR) induction. Furthermore, these studies implicate biochanin A's inactivation of p38-MAPK as a possible contributor to reducing p75(NTR) with associated increased cell survival.

This study was designed to evaluate the ability of ibuprofen-loaded poly(l-lactic acid)-polyethylene glycol (PELA) diblock copolymer fibrous membranes in preventing adhesion formation and reduce inflammation. Electrospun PELA fibrous membranes underwent mechanical testing and were characterized by morphology, surface wettability, drug release, and degradation. Results of an in vitro drug release study showed that a burst release was followed by sustained release from fibrous membranes with high initial ibuprofen content. Fewer L929 mouse fibroblasts adhered to and proliferated on the ibuprofen-loaded PELA fibrous membrane compared with tissue culture plates or PELA fibrous membrane without ibuprofen. In a chicken model of flexor digitorum profundus tendon surgery, the ibuprofen-loaded PELA fibrous membranes prevented tissue adhesion and significantly reduced inflammation.

We recently found that Naproxen, but not other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen, Celebrex, Diclofenac), can induce type X collagen gene (COL10A1) expression in bone-marrow-derived MSCs from healthy and OA donors. In this study we determined the effect of Naproxen on COL X protein expression and investigated the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression in normal and OA hMSCs. MSCs of OA patients were isolated from aspirates from the intramedullary canal of donors (50-80 years of age) undergoing hip replacement surgery for OA and were treated with or without Naproxen (100 μg/mL). Protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (COL X, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [p38], phosphorylated-p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase [JNK], phosphorylated-JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK], and phosphorylated-ERK). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the expression of COL10A1 and Runt-related transcription factor 2 gene (Runx2). Our results show that Naproxen significantly stimulated COL X protein expression after 72 h of exposure both in normal and OA hMSCs. The basal phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (ERK, JNK, and p38) in OA hMSCs was significantly higher than in normal. Naproxen significantly increased the MAPK phosphorylation in normal and OA hMSCs. NSAID cellular effects include cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. To investigate the involvement of these pathways in the Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression, we incubated normal and OA hMSCs with Naproxen with and without inhibitors of ERK (U0126), JNK (BI-78D3), p38 (SB203580), and 5-lipoxygenase (MK-886). Our results showed that increased basal COL10A1 expression in OA hMSCs was significantly suppressed in the presence of JNK and p38 inhibitors, whereas Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression was suppressed by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. This study shows that Naproxen induces COL X both at transcriptional and translational levels in normal and OA hMSCs. Elevated basal COL10A1 expression in OA hMSCs is probably through the activation of MAPK pathway and Naproxen-induced COL10A1 expression is through the increased 5-lipoxygenase signaling.",2015,,"Alaseem AM, Madiraju P, Aldebeyan SA, Noorwali H, Antoniou J, Mwale F.",https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.TEA.2014.0148,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Studies of the effects of NSAIDs upon the inflammatory response surrounding amyloid plaques and upon the generation of Abeta from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) have led to two proposed mechanisms by which NSAIDs may protect against Alzheimer's disease: one, the selective lowering of Abeta42 by a subset of NSAIDs; and two, the reduction of inflammation. Although Alzheimer's disease is a disorder of brain and synaptic function, the effects of NSAIDs on Abeta-mediated suppression of synaptic plasticity and memory function have never been reported. We therefore investigated how three different NSAIDs, chosen for their distinct effects on Abeta42 production and the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, affect memory function and synaptic plasticity. By focusing upon brain and synapse function, we made novel observations about the effects of NSAIDs on Abeta-mediated neural processes. Here we report that the selective inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1, acutely prevented the suppression of hippocampal long-term plasticity (LTP) by Abeta. The non-selective NSAIDs, ibuprofen and naproxen, and a selective COX-2 inhibitor, MF-tricyclic, each restored memory function in Tg2576 mice over-expressing APP, and also blocked Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP. There was no advantage of ibuprofen, a selective Abeta42-lowering agent (SALA), over the non-SALAs, naproxen and MF-tricyclic. The beneficial effects on memory did not depend upon lowered levels of Abeta42 or the inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta). Intriguingly, improved memory function was inversely related to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. Conversely, exogenous PGE2 prevented the restorative effects of COX-2 inhibitors on LTP. The data indicate that the inhibition of COX-2 blocks Abeta-mediated suppression of LTP and memory function, and that this block occurs independently of reductions in Abeta42 or decreases in inflammation. The results lead us to propose a third possible mechanism by which NSAIDs may protect against Alzheimer's disease, involving the blockade of a COX-2-mediated PGE2 response at synapses.",2008,,"Kotilinek LA, Westerman MA, Wang Q, Panizzon K, Lim GP, Simonyi A, Lesne S, Falinska A, Younkin LH, Younkin SG, Rowan M, Cleary J, Wallis RA, Sun GY, Cole G, Frautschy S, Anwyl R, Ashe KH.",http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/131/3/651,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Extra virgin olive oil contains a phenolic compound, oleocanthal, which is thought to share unique chemesthetic qualities with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen. Pilot work suggested participants had difficulty distinguishing between multiple chemesthetic subqualities (e.g., burn, sting, itch, tickle, etc.) in a multiattribute rating task. Here, we assessed overall irritation via direct scaling, and a check all that apply task was used to collect information about chemesthetic subqualities over time. Replicated ratings were collected at discrete intervals using the generalized labeled magnitude scale to generate time-intensity curves; maximum intensity (Imax) and area under the curve were extracted for each participant. Intensity responses varied substantially across participants, and within a participant, the relationship was strongest between ibuprofen and olive oil. However, there were also positive, albeit weaker, correlations between capsaicin and ibuprofen and capsaicin and olive oil. The correlation found between olive oil and capsaicin may suggest the presence of unknown TRPV1 agonists in olive oil. This view was also supported by the qualitative data: capsaicin was described most often as burning and warm/hot, whereas ibuprofen was numbing and tickling. Olive oil shared characteristics with both capsaicin (warm/hot) and ibuprofen (tickle).",2012,,"Bennett SM, Hayes JE.",https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjr129,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We assessed the range of analgesic requirements under AA after ambulatory knee arthroscopy. Twenty patients randomly received a true AA procedure (Lung, Shenmen and Knee points) or sham procedure (three non-acupuncture points on the auricular helix) before ambulatory knee arthroscopy. Permanent press AA needles were retained in situ for one day after surgery. Post-operative pain was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen, and weak oral opioid tramadol was used for rescue analgesic medication. The quantity of post-operative analgesics and pain intensity were used to assess the effect of AA. The incidence of analgesia-related side effects, time to discharge from the anesthesia recovery room, heart rate and blood pressure were also recorded. Ibuprofen consumption after surgery in the AA group was lower than in the control group: median 500 versus 800 mg, P = 0.043. Pain intensity on a 100 mm visual analogue scale for pain measurement and other parameters were similar in both groups.

Fever, the regulated increase in the body temperature, is part of the evolved systemic reaction to infection known as the acute phase response. The heat of fever augments the performance of immune cells, induces stress on pathogens and infected cells directly, and combines with other stressors to provide a nonspecific immune defense. Observational trials in humans suggest a survival benefit from fever, and randomized trials published before COVID-19 do not support fever reduction in patients with infection. Like public health measures that seem burdensome and excessive, fevers involve costly trade-offs but they can prevent infection from getting out of control. For infections with novel SARS-CoV-2, the precautionary principle applies: unless evidence suggests otherwise, we advise that fever should be allowed to run its course. Lay summary: For COVID-19, many public health organizations have advised treating fever with medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Even though this is a common practice, lowering body temperature has not improved survival in laboratory animals or in patients with infections. Blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defense against infection. Fever works by causing more damage to pathogens and infected cells than it does to healthy cells in the body. During pandemic COVID-19, the benefits of allowing fever to occur probably outweigh its harms, for individuals and for the public at large.",2021,,"Wrotek S, LeGrand EK, Dzialuk A, Alcock J.",https://academic.oup.com/emph/article-pdf/9/1/26/41145756/eoaa044.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Managing their removal is however complicated by the difficulties in predicting degradation rates. In this work, we demonstrate that the complexity of the pollutant profile, the set of co-existing contaminants, is a major driver of biodegradation in wastewater. We built representative assemblages out of one to five common pharmaceuticals (caffeine, atenolol, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and enalapril) selected along a gradient of biodegradability. We followed their individual removal by wastewater microbial communities. The presence of multichemical background pollution was essential for the removal of recalcitrant molecules such as ibuprofen. High-order interactions between multiple pollutants drove removal efficiency. We explain these interactions by shifts in the microbiome, with degradable molecules such as paracetamol enriching species and pathways involved in the removal of several organic pollutants. We conclude that pollutants should be treated as part of a complex system, with emerging pollutants potentially showing cascading effects and offering leverage to promote bioremediation.",2024,,"Suleiman M, Le Lay N, Demaria F, Kolvenbach BA, Cretoiu MS, Petchey OL, Jousset A, Corvini PF.",https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wrae033,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infection of the dermal layers of the skin and manifests as a variety of skin lesions from defined nodular forms to plaques and chronic ulcers. The aim of this work was to characterize the physiology and barrier integrity of the Leishmania-infected BALB/c mouse skin and how they impacted delivery of drugs into the skin.<h4>Methods</h4>A histological evaluation of the structural differences between uninfected and infected skin was performed using haematoxylin/eosin, elastic Van Gieson and Iba-1 stains. As a CL nodule developed and progressed, the skin pH, hydration and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) were recorded. Finally, Franz diffusion cells were used to evaluate the influence of the infection on drug delivery through the skin.<h4>Results</h4>We found: (i) structural changes in both the epidermal and dermal layers due to the ingress of inflammatory cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry; (ii) a significant increase in TEWL; and (iii) significantly higher permeation of the model permeants caffeine and ibuprofen and the antileishmanial drugs buparvaquone and paromomycin, for Leishmania-infected skin compared with uninfected skin.

MED,37948276,37948276,10.1093/milmed/usad142,Legal Performance-enhancing Drugs Alter Course and Treatment of Rhabdomyolysis-induced Acute Kidney Injury.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury (RIAKI) can interrupt physical training and increase mortality in injured warfighters. The legal performance-enhancing drugs caffeine and ibuprofen, which can cause renal injury, are widely used by service members. Whether caffeine or ibuprofen affects RIAKI is unknown. Cilastatin treatment was recently identified as an experimental treatment to prevent RIAKI at injury. To determine potential interacting factors in RIAKI treatment, we test the hypothesis that caffeine and ibuprofen worsen RIAKI and interfere with treatment.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In mice, RIAKI was induced by glycerol intramuscular injection. Simultaneously, mice received caffeine (3 mg/kg), ibuprofen (10 mg/kg), or vehicle. A second cohort received volume resuscitation (PlasmaLyte, 20 mL/kg) in addition to caffeine or ibuprofen. In a third cohort, cilastatin (200 mg/kg) was administered concurrently with drug and glycerol administration. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine output (UOP), renal pathology, and renal immunofluorescence for kidney injury molecule 1 were quantified after 24 hours.<h4>Results</h4>Caffeine did not worsen RIAKI; although BUN was modestly increased by caffeine administration, 24-hour GFR, UOP, and renal histopathology were similar between vehicle-treated, caffeine-treated, and caffeine + PlasmaLyte-treated mice. Ibuprofen administration greatly worsened RIAKI (GFR 14.3 ± 19.5 vs. 577.4 ± 454.6 µL/min/100 g in control, UOP 0.5 ± 0.4 in ibuprofen-treated mice vs. 2.7 ± 1.7 mL/24 h in control, and BUN 264 ± 201 in ibuprofen-treated mice vs. 66 ± 21 mg/dL in control, P < .05 for all); PlasmaLyte treatment did not reverse this effect. Cilastatin with or without PlasmaLyte did not reverse the deleterious effect of ibuprofen in RIAKI.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Caffeine does not worsen RIAKI. The widely used performance-enhancing drug ibuprofen greatly worsens RIAKI in mice. Standard or experimental treatment of RIAKI including the addition of cilastatin to standard resuscitation is ineffective in mice with RIAKI exacerbated by ibuprofen. These findings may have clinical implications for the current therapy of RIAKI and for translational studies of novel treatment.",2023,,"Hebert JF, Eiwaz MB, Nickerson MN, Munhall AC, Pai AA, Groat T, Andeen NK, Hutchens MP.",https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usad142,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,20046466,20046466,10.1093/pch/7.8.538,The adverse renal effects of prostaglandin-synthesis inhibition in the fetus and the newborn.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To summarize experimental animal data and to provide a limited literature review on the adverse renal effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the developing fetus and the maturing newborn.<h4>Data</h4>The experimental data were obtained from anesthetized, ventilated, six- to eight-day-old rabbits that received an intravenous bolus of either acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ibuprofen (IBU) or indomethacin (INDO). In one set of experiments, ASA was also tested in 12-week-old (young adult) rabbits. Renal function was monitored with inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow. The renal vascular resistance was calculated. All three nonspecific cyclo-oxygenase-1 or -2 (COX-1/2) inhibitors caused remarkably similar reversible, oliguric, acute renal failure (ARF). In young adult animals, the side effects were attenuated. The underlying pathophysiology is related to the carefully maintained low GFR of the fetus and the newborn, dependent on a delicate interplay between vasoconstriction (angiotensin II) and vasodilation (prostaglandins [PGs]). When PG-synthesis is inhibited, the vasoconstriction is relatively unopposed, causing ARF.<h4>Literature review</h4>The renal effects of fetal exposure to NSAIDs are discussed, as are new insights into the role of COX-1/2 for a normal nephrogenesis. COX-nil or COX-inhibited animals have long lasting renal structural injury. Fetuses exposed in utero to significant amounts of NSAIDs have at birth various degrees of renal insufficiency and structural renal defects with a very high mortality.<h4>Conclusions</h4>All NSAIDs, both specific and nonspecific COX inhibitors, have renal side effects in the immediate post-natal period and should, therefore, be given with the utmost caution. NSAIDs given during pregnancy for the prevention of toxemia, polyhydramnios and premature labour may affect fetal renal function and structure.

We tested the hypothesis that these pharmaceuticals are endocrine disruptors in fish by examining their impact on interrenal corticosteroidogenesis in rainbow trout. Indeed, acute adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-mediated cortisol production in trout interrenal cells in vitro was significantly depressed (20-40%) by these pharmaceutical drugs. Furthermore, we investigated whether this interrenal dysfunction involved inhibition of the steroidogenic capacity in rainbow trout. To this end, we fed trout salicylate-laced feed (100 mg/kg body weight) for 3 days and assessed the transcript levels of key proteins involved in corticosteroidogenesis, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (P450scc), and 11beta-hydroxylase. Salicylate treatment did not affect the resting plasma cortisol or glucose levels, whereas the acute ACTH-stimulated cortisol production was significantly depressed in the interrenal tissue. This disruption of steroidogenesis by salicylate corresponded to a significant drop in the gene expression of StAR and PBR, but not P450scc or 11beta-hydroxylase, compared to the sham-treated fish. Also, brain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein content and not GR mRNA level was significantly reduced by salicylate. Taken together, salicylate is a corticosteroid disruptor in trout and the targets include the key rate-limiting step in interrenal steroidogenesis and brain glucocorticoid signaling.",2006,,"Gravel A, Vijayan MM.",http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/1/41.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Clinical data show that mixed COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors such as aspirin, but not COX-2 selective inhibitors such as rofecoxib, induce bronchoconstriction and asthma in sensitive individuals. This anomaly has not yet been explained. Here, we have used tissue from genetically modified mice lacking functional COX-1 (COX-1(-/-)), as well as airway tissue from ""aspirin-sensitive"" and control patients to address this issue. Bronchi from wild-type mice contained predominantly COX-1 immunoreactivity and contracted in vitro in response to acetylcholine and U46619. Bronchi from COX-1(-/-) mice were hyperresponsive to bronchoconstrictors. Inhibitors of COX (naproxen, diclofenac, or ibuprofen) increased bronchoconstriction in tissue from wild-type but not from COX-1(-/-) mice. Cells cultured from aspirin-sensitive or control human donors contained similar levels of COX-1 and COX-2 immunoreactivity. COX activity in cells from aspirin-sensitive or tolerant patients was inhibited by aspirin, SC560, which blocks COX-1 selectively, but not by rofecoxib, which is a selective inhibitor of COX-2.

We compared the microvasculature of etomidate-anesthetized animals to that of animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, since its effects on the microvasculature are known. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with etomidate or pentobarbital. The cremaster muscle was prepared for microscopic viewing, leaving the neural and vascular supply intact. Small arterioles were near their maximal diameters in etomidate-anesthetized rats, whereas the pentobarbital group had a large dilator capacity (maximal diameter-basal diameter/basal diameter). The effect on resting arteriolar diameters of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors was tested. Dilator capacity was not affected by the EDRF inhibitor nitro-L-arginine, but it was significantly increased by mefenamic acid and ibuprofen in etomidate-anesthetized animals. To test whether dilator and constrictor mechanisms were normal, serotonin concentration-response curves were obtained in pentobarbital and etomidate-anesthetized animals with and without mefenamate or ibuprofen present. The dilation of small arterioles to serotonin in the etomidate groups with mefenamate or ibuprofen was not significantly different from that of the pentobarbital groups. Serotonin produced a comparable constriction of large arterioles in both anesthetic groups. The topical application of etomidate to the cremaster muscle did not affect arteriolar diameters.

Effect of ibuprofen pretreatment.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Surgical stress induces hormonal and cytokine responses proportional to the extent of the injury. Therefore, the authors assessed the effect of ibuprofen pretreatment on metabolic and hormonal changes after surgery.<h4>Summary background data</h4>Postoperative administration of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor reduces cytokine production and nitrogen losses.<h4>Methods</h4>The authors studied the plasma hormones and metabolic and cytokines changes after perioperative ibuprofen administration in 22 patients undergoing cholecystectomy under inhalational anesthesia.

The ACTH (p < 0.01), cortisol (p < 0.01), and glucose changes (p < 0.001) were smaller in the ibuprofen group and their duration was shorter. The interleukin-6 levels increased gradually after skin incision until the sixth hour and were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the ibuprofen group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen pretreatment in perioperative course is able to reduce the endocrine response and cytokine release.

Immediately after peritoneal incision, eventration and action of the small bowel was intentionally performed in a uniform fashion.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Baseline values were obtained before induction of anesthesia. Additional measurements, along with assessments of hemodynamics and gas exchange, were performed before incision of the peritoneum and at 5, 30, and 45 mins and 3, 6, and 24 hrs after mesenteric traction. Arterial plasma concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 (stable metabolites of PGI2 and thromboxane A2) were determined by radioimmunoassay. Endotoxin was measured by limulus amebocyte lysate test. Mesenteric lymph nodes were sampled in 31 patients (ibuprofen n = 14, placebo n = 17) and sent for culture under sterile conditions. Transient hypotension and a marked increase of plasma 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha concentrations occurred up to 6 hrs after mesenteric traction in untreated patients with median peak concentrations (2243 vs. 72 ng/L [p < .0001, placebo vs. ibuprofen], observed 5 mins after mesenteric traction). Endotoxemia occurred in both study groups. However, after mesenteric traction, plasma endotoxin concentrations were significantly higher in the ibuprofen group. Median peak concentrations (0.12 vs. 0.27 EU/mL [p < .001, placebo vs. ibuprofen]) were observed 3 hrs after mesenteric traction. Gram-negative bacteria in mesenteric lymph nodes were detected exclusively in the ibuprofen group (n = 5, p < .01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In ibuprofen-pretreated patients, significantly higher endotoxin concentrations as well as bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes occurred, despite the absence of a transient decrease in mean arterial pressure that had been associated with PGI2 release. Therefore, we hypothesized that during major abdominal surgery, endogenous PGI2 released in response to mesenteric traction may play a crucial role in maintaining splanchnic microcirculation and thus preserving gut mucosal barrier function.",1996,,"Brinkmann A, Wolf CF, Berger D, Kneitinger E, Neumeister B, Büchler M, Radermacher P, Seeling W, Georgieff M.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00003246-199608000-00005,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

At the immediate site of injury, vessels lose patency. In the periphery, vasodilation and increased permeability become widespread. A variety of interventions were employed to prevent these vascular sequelae. While systemic treatment, immediately after burn trauma, with hydrocortisone or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound indomethacin, was ineffective in preventing vascular alteration, treatments with other NSAI agents such as ibuprofen and imidazole were effective in preventing microvascular occlusion. In addition, utilizing standard radioimmunoassay techniques, the concentrations of the metabolites of two potent eicosanoids, thromboxane and prostacyclin, were measured from fluid collected in the implanted wound chambers. Following full-thickness burns, the synthesis and release of thromboxane were inhibited by indomethacin, imidazole, and ibuprofen. Furthermore, indomethacin and ibuprofen, but not imidazole, blocked the synthesis and release of prostacyclin into wound fluid. Significantly, ibuprofen was effective in preserving the dermal vasculature, even when administration was delayed as long as 6 hours after burn trauma. Pharmacologic actions not associated with the production of thromboxane or prostacyclin appear responsible for the protective effects of ibuprofen during burn injury. Such findings do not support an important role for either thromboxane or prostacyclin in the development of vascular alterations following burn injury.",1984,,Ehrlich HP.,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005373-198404000-00005,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Burn prostanoid production, measured in lymph, increased ten- to fifteen-fold for both thromboxane A2, measured as TxB2, and prostacyclin, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. The intravenous administration of ibuprofen, 12.5 mg/kg, eliminated both the increase in Ppa and decrease in PaO2 as well as the increase in burn lymph prostanoids. However, plasma prostanoids were also decreased below baseline, a potentially deleterious effect. A topical ibuprofen cream, 5% ibuprofen in a water-soluble ester, was applied to the burn hide every 6 hrs x 4 after which endotoxin was again injected below the hide. The pulmonary dysfunction was prevented as was the increase in plasma TxB2 with the value remaining at baseline. Burn lymph levels were only increased three- to five fold. Ibuprofen levels in burn lymph were maintained at 1-2 mcg/ml. The addition of the cream to the burn, however, did increase the wound bacterial content to 10(5)-10(7) bacteria/gram of tissue compared to 10(2)-10(3) for the dry, untreated burn, probably due to softening of the burn. Topically applied ibuprofen, therefore, can decrease burn wound prostanoid production from local endotoxin, preventing lung dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1986,,"Katz A, Ryan P, Lalonde C, West K, Demling R.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00005373-198602000-00011,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Leukocytes play an important role during many processes, including inflammation. They migrate from intravascular spaces into tissues and attack microorganisms. In a recent study, the inhibitory effects of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, on leukocyte transmigration were demonstrated using an in vitro assay. Little is known about the cellular effects of garlic extracts (Allium sativum). The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of garlic extract on leukocyte migration through endothelial cell monolayers and thereby evaluate a possible role in inflammatory processes. Human umbilical endothelial cells were cultured on microporous membranes to make an endothelial cell monolayer (ECM). Freshly isolated neutrophils were used in a recently described migration assay. The amount of untreated neutrophils migrating through the untreated ECM was used as control and set at 100%. Neutrophils and/or ECM were pretreated with garlic extract using moderate, higher, and lower concentrations. Moderate plasma concentrations of garlic extract inhibited neutrophil migration through ECM significantly (64 +/- 5.8% standard deviation [SD]; P < 0.05) when both cell types were treated, (a situation that may have clinical relevance). Treating either neutrophils or ECM alone showed significant reductions in migratory rate (neutrophils treated alone: 81 +/- 7.7% SD, P < 0.05; ECM alone: 70 +/- 6.7%, P < 0.05). Thus, garlic extract is identified as a potent inhibitor of leukocyte migration through endothelial cell monolayers. Treatment of both cell types has an additive effect. Endothelial cells seem to be more affected than neutrophils. Further investigations are necessary to understand the potential clinical consequences.",2001,,"Hofbauer R, Frass M, Gmeiner B, Kaye AD, Frost EA.",https://doi.org/10.1097/00132580-200101000-00003,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and onset of analgesia of this new formulation with standard IBU tablets after a single dose.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Patients (N=316) with at least moderate baseline postsurgical dental pain were randomized to 400 mg IBUNa, Advil (IBUAdv), Motrin (IBUMot), or placebo. Primary endpoints were time-weighted sum of pain relief (PR) and pain intensity differences over 8 hours (SPRID 0-8) and time to onset of meaningful pain relief (TMPR) measured by the double-stopwatch method.<h4>Results</h4>SPRID 0-8 was significantly greater for IBUNa and the other active treatments versus placebo (P<0.001). IBUNa had a significantly earlier TMPR versus placebo, pooled IBUAdv/IBUMot, and IBUMot (P<0.001 for all), and a marginally faster TMPR (P=0.075) versus IBUAdv. Results for secondary endpoints were similar. Adverse events were comparable across treatment groups, with gastrointestinal disorders being most frequently reported. Most adverse events were mild or moderate.<h4>Discussion</h4>This novel formulation of IBUNa provided superior overall PR compared with placebo and more rapid onset of analgesic effect compared with standard IBU tablets.

Self-reported pain and fear as well as observer-rated distress were critically important outcomes. Data were combined using standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI).<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-five studies that examined breastfeeding (which combines sweet-tasting solution, holding, and sucking), topical anesthetics, sweet-tasting solutions (sucrose, glucose), vapocoolants, oral analgesics, and combination of 2 versus 1 intervention were included. The following results report findings of analyses of critical outcomes with the largest number of participants. Compared with control, acute distress was lower for infants breastfed: (1) during vaccination (n=792): SMD -1.78 (CI, -2.35, -1.22) and (2) before vaccination (n=100): SMD -1.43 (CI, -2.14, -0.72). Compared with control/placebo, topical anesthetics showed benefit on acute distress in children (n=1424): SMD -0.91 (CI, -1.36, -0.47) and self-reported pain in adults (n=60): SMD -0.85 (CI, -1.38, -0.32). Acute and recovery distress was lower for children who received sucrose (n=2071): SMD -0.76 (CI, -1.19, -0.34) or glucose (n=818): SMD -0.69 (CI, -1.03, -0.35) compared with placebo/no treatment. Vapocoolants reduced acute pain in adults [(n=185), SMD -0.78 (CI, -1.08, -0.48)] but not children. Evidence from other needle procedures showed no benefit of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. The administration of topical anesthetics before and breastfeeding during vaccine injections showed mixed results when compared with topical anesthetics alone. There were no additive benefits of combining glucose and non-nutritive sucking (pacifier) compared with glucose or non-nutritive sucking (pacifier) alone or breastfeeding and sucrose compared with breastfeeding or sucrose alone.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Breastfeeding, topical anesthetics, sweet-tasting solutions, and combination of topical anesthetics and breastfeeding demonstrated evidence of benefit for reducing vaccine injection pain in infants and children.

Whether such drugs, here denoted as 'concomitant drugs', have anticancer effects or interact at the tumor cell level with the anticancer drugs is not very well known. The cytotoxic effects of nine concomitant drugs and their interactions with five anti-cancer drugs commonly used for the treatment of colorectal cancer were screened over broad ranges of drug concentrations in vitro in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116wt. Seven additional tyrosine kinase inhibitors were included to further evaluate key findings as were primary cultures of tumor cells from patients with colorectal cancer. Cytotoxic effects were evaluated using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) and interaction analysis was based on Bliss independent interaction analysis. Simvastatin and loperamide, included here as an opioid agonists, were found to have cytotoxic effects on their own at reasonably low concentrations whereas betamethasone, enalapril, ibuprofen, metformin, metoclopramide, metoprolol and paracetamol were inactive also at very high concentrations. Drug interactions ranged from antagonistic to synergistic over the concentrations tested with a more homogenous pattern of synergy between simvastatin and protein kinase inhibitors in HCT116wt cells.

The purpose of this study was to identify molecular targets for NSAIDs related to cellular toxicity with a view to optimize drug efficacy in the clinic. Coronary artery smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells were treated with low (clinically achievable) and high (typically used in preclinical studies) concentrations of celecoxib, NS398, and ibuprofen for 24 hours. NSAIDs-induced gene expression changes were evaluated by microarray analysis and validated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The functional significance of differentially expressed genes was evaluated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. At high concentrations, NSAIDs altered the expression of genes regulating cell proliferation and cell death. NSAIDs also altered genes associated with cardiovascular functions including inflammation, thrombosis, fibrinolysis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. The gene expression was most impacted by ibuprofen, celecoxib, and NS398, in that order. This study revealed that NSAIDs altered expression of an array of genes associated with cardiovascular events and emphasizes the potential for fingerprinting drugs in preclinical studies to assess the potential drug toxicity and to optimize the drug efficacy in clinical settings.",2012,,"Palayoor ST, J-Aryankalayil M, Makinde AY, Cerna D, Falduto MT, Magnuson SR, Coleman CN.",https://doi.org/10.1097/FJC.0b013e31824ba6b5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We describe the occurrence of silent ACS of the hand in a 2-year old patient with atypical symptoms.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>Our patient experienced massive swelling but minimal pain of the hand after a heavy bistro table with a stone tabletop had fallen on the right hand.<h4>Diagnosis</h4>After monitoring the development of ACS for 1 night, we noted increased firmness of the swelling and impaired perfusion of the skin covering the palm and dorsum of the hand. Notably, the patient held the hand in an intrinsic minus position but did not complain of pain after administration of only a single (weight-matched) dose of ibuprofen. Our suspicion of ACS was confirmed intraoperatively because of the elevated intramuscular pressure (up to 60 mm Hg) in several hand compartments.<h4>Interventions</h4>We performed surgical fasciotomy of all hand compartments, followed by temporary coverage of the wounds with Epigard synthetic skin substitute. The wounds were closed stepwise after 2 and 7 days, and occupational therapy was initiated after 3 weeks.<h4>Outcomes</h4>At the 1-year follow-up, we noted unrestricted wrist and finger functions of the patient. The parents reported that there was no difference in the use of the 2 hands during daily activities.<h4>Lessons</h4>The possible development of ACS should be borne in mind even in the absence of marked pain.

However, the difference between the efficacy and safety of the treatment of PD is not clear. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of simple-needling for PD patients through a comparison with ibuprofen.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive search of 7 electronic databases and relevant medical journals, from the establishment of the publication to December 2020. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria, and a meta-analysis was performed with the Review Manager version (RevMan version 5.3).<h4>Results</h4>Twenty three RCTs were included. The meta-analysis reported that simple-needling groups had better than ibuprofen groups on cure rate (relative risk = 2.29, 95% CI [1.96, 2.68], P < .00001) and total effective rate (relative risk = 1.24, 95% CI [1.19, 1.29], P < .00001) and VAS score (MD = -1.24, 95% CI [-1.92, -0.55], P = .0004). Seven studies reported adverse events, of which 4 studies had mild adverse events.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Simple-needling is superior to ibuprofen treatment in terms of clinical efficacy and improvement of pain symptoms.

However, there is currently no available literature reporting the impact of ibuprofen-sustained release capsules on liver failure.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>A 65-year-old man was presented with a 4-day history of tea-colored urine with oil avoidance, jaundiced skin, and anorexia, and impaired liver function. One ibuprofen-sustained release capsule was taken on the day before the onset of the disease due to ""headache.""<h4>Diagnoses</h4>A diagnosis of this patient was made of liver failure due to taking ibuprofen-sustained release capsules.<h4>Interventions</h4>Initially, the patient discontinued the use of hepatotoxic drugs in order to prevent further exposure. Subsequently, the patient underwent a standard therapeutic regimen, which encompassed the administration of hepatoprotective agents, nutritional support drugs, correction of acid-base imbalances, and electrolyte abnormalities, as well as other relevant treatments.<h4>Outcomes</h4>After 9 days of hepatoprotective and nutritional supplement therapy, the patient saw notable improvement in symptoms, reporting an absence of discomfort, subsided skin jaundice, clear urine, and liver function tests returning to a near normal range. The patient was granted permission to be discharged from the hospital while being prescribed drugs. After 2 weeks of follow-up, the patient reported an absence of discomfort and exhibited normal results in the liver function test.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Liver failure caused by ibuprofen-sustained release capsules has not been reported. It is worth noting that conventional treatments such as suspending offending agents, and administration of hepatoprotective agents and nutritional support drugs have proven to be successful.<h4>Lesson</h4>There is currently no known peer-reviewed literature indicating that the administration of ibuprofen-sustained release capsules leads to liver failure. When patients taking ibuprofen-sustained release capsules encounter symptoms such as anorexia, skin jaundice, lack of appetite, and nausea, it is recommended that they undertake a cardiac and liver function tests.

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the occurrence of only single propagators of discomfort. Clinical studies with eye drop solutions have shown that a mixture of diverse comfort agents selected to address multiple propagators of discomfort provide the greatest and longest lasting sensations of comfort for the patient. In this paper, multiple propagators of discomfort are addressed through the simultaneous release of four molecules from a novel contact lens to ensure high level of lens wear comfort.<h4>Methods</h4>Silicone hydrogel contact lenses were engineered via molecular imprinting strategies to simultaneously release up to four template molecules including hydropropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), trehalose, ibuprofen, and prednisolone.<h4>Results</h4>By adjusting the ratio of functional monomer to comfort molecule, a high level of control was demonstrated over the release rate. HPMC, trehalose, ibuprofen, and prednisolone were released at therapeutically relevant concentrations with varying rates from a single lens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate use as daily disposable lenses for single day release or extended-wear lenses with multiple day release. Imprinted lenses are expected to lead to higher efficacy for patients compared to topical eye drops by improving compliance and mitigating concentration peaks and valleys associated with multiple drops.",2016,,"White CJ, DiPasquale SA, Byrne ME.",https://doi.org/10.1097/OPX.0000000000000849,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pain is associated with chronic wounds, and its impact can vary according to wound aetiology, condition, and patient factors. This systematic review examined the effectiveness of topical interventions in the management chronic wound-related pain guided by PRISMA recommendations of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where pain reduction is the primary outcome. Inclusion criteria were adults (older than 18 years) with chronic venous, arterial, diabetic, or pressure ulcers where pain has been managed through topical administration of pharmacological/nonpharmacological agents. Searches were conducted in Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies were screened for eligibility; risk of bias and data were extracted by 2 independent assessors. Searches retrieved 10,327 titles and abstracts (7760 after deduplication). Nine full texts (1323 participants) examining ibuprofen (n = 4), morphine (n = 2), BWD + PHMB [polihexanide-containing biocellulose wound dressing] (n = 1), and EMLA (n = 2) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Meta-analysis was not possible, but initial exploration suggests improved outcomes (reduced pain) for ibuprofen when compared with controls. Two studies involving morphine showed conflicting findings. Included studies often had small samples, and considering confounding factors (eg, comorbidities), the results should be interpreted with caution.

MED,25405970,25405970,10.1098/rstb.2013.0583,Comparative metabolism as a key driver of wildlife species sensitivity to human and veterinary pharmaceuticals.,"Human and veterinary drug development addresses absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicology (ADMET) of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) in the target species. Metabolism is an important factor in controlling circulating plasma and target tissue API concentrations and in generating metabolites which are more easily eliminated in bile, faeces and urine. The essential purpose of xenobiotic metabolism is to convert lipid-soluble, non-polar and non-excretable chemicals into water soluble, polar molecules that are readily excreted. Xenobiotic metabolism is classified into Phase I enzymatic reactions (which add or expose reactive functional groups on xenobiotic molecules), Phase II reactions (resulting in xenobiotic conjugation with large water-soluble, polar molecules) and Phase III cellular efflux transport processes. The human-fish plasma model provides a useful approach to understanding the pharmacokinetics of APIs (e.g. diclofenac, ibuprofen and propranolol) in freshwater fish, where gill and liver metabolism of APIs have been shown to be of importance. By contrast, wildlife species with low metabolic competency may exhibit zero-order metabolic (pharmacokinetic) profiles and thus high API toxicity, as in the case of diclofenac and the dramatic decline of vulture populations across the Indian subcontinent. A similar threat looms for African Cape Griffon vultures exposed to ketoprofen and meloxicam, recent studies indicating toxicity relates to zero-order metabolism (suggesting P450 Phase I enzyme system or Phase II glucuronidation deficiencies). While all aspects of ADMET are important in toxicity evaluations, these observations demonstrate the importance of methods for predicting API comparative metabolism as a central part of environmental risk assessment.",2014,,"Hutchinson TH, Madden JC, Naidoo V, Walker CH.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2013.0583,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

At 10 mg/ml, ibuprofen showed a rapid cidal activity against exponential growth phase C. albicans, accompanied by rapid and extensive leakage of intracellular K+, permeation to propidium iodide, lysis of spheroplasts and severe membrane ultrastructural alterations. These results indicate that the killing of Candida cells is due to direct damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. At 5 mg/ml, ibuprofen inhibited growth; however, it did not kill the yeasts and did not directly affect the cytoplasmic membrane. Evaluation of yeast metabolic vitality with the fluorescent probe FUN-1 showed that growth inhibition induced by the fungistatic drug concentration was due to metabolic alterations. The combination of ibuprofen with fluconazole resulted in synergic activity with eight of the 12 Candida strains studied, including four of the five fluconazole-resistant strains.

However, there is no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on analyses of available data, we deduced that the excessive prostaglandins E 2 (PGE 2 ) accumulation mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was the key pathological basis of COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> The urine PGE 2 levels were measured by mass spectrometry. An experimental study about Celebrex to treat COVID-19 was conducted based on routine treatment. A total of 44 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled (Experimental group n=37, Control group n=7).

Here, we established complementary in vitro human lung models integrating alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells and airway air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures to evaluate standard-of-care antibiotics, host-directed therapies, and virulence-targeting agents. AMLs recapitulated key morphological, transcriptional, and functional features of primary alveolar macrophages, including a CD16 + immunoregulatory phenotype highly permissive to Mtb infection. In parallel, ALI cultures maintained epithelial barrier integrity and secretory functions, allowing apical Mtb infection, drug penetration analysis, and inflammatory profiling. Benchmarking of standard-of-care antibiotics revealed compartment-specific activity: isoniazid, rifampicin, and moxifloxacin were effective in both systems, while pyrazinamide was active only in AMLs. Anti-inflammatory host-directed therapies such as ibuprofen and doramapimod selectively reduced cytokine production without affecting bacterial load.

This study analyzed the electrostatic interaction energies of selected NSAIDs (flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, meloxicam and celecoxib) with the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2, revealing significant differences in binding profiles. Flurbiprofen exhibited the strongest interactions with both COX-1 and COX-2, indicating its potent binding affinity. Celecoxib and meloxicam showed a preference for COX-2, consistent with their known selectivity for this isoform, while ibuprofen showed comparable interaction energies with both isoforms, reflecting its nonselective inhibition pattern. Key amino-acid residues, including Arg120, Arg/His513 and Tyr355, were identified as critical determinants of NSAID selectivity and binding affinity. The findings highlight the complex interplay between interaction energy and selectivity, suggesting that while electrostatic interactions play a fundamental role, additional factors such as enzyme dynamics and the hydrophobic effect also contribute to the therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles of NSAIDs.

Hairless guinea pigs were pretreated in vivo for 24 h with either 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) to induce irritant contact dermatitis or with water (controls). Twenty-four hours after pretreatment animals were sacrificed. Percutaneous penetration was then measured using in vitro diffusion cells and the removed (pretreated) skin. The following parameters were determined: cumulative amount of compound penetrated, steady state flux, lag time, and permeability coefficient, skin concentration per unit area, and the relative amount of drug remaining in the skin (as a percentage of the cumulative amount of compound penetrated through the skin). SLS pretreatment resulted in moderate irritant dermatitis in all animals and increased in vivo transepidermal water loss 4.5 times. Flux was increased in SLS-pretreated skin as compared with controls for all four compounds, with the greatest enhancement for hydrocortisone (HC) (5.9 times), followed by indomethacin (IM) (4.6 times), ibuprofen (IB) (3.9 times), and acitretin (AC) (3.4 times). Skin concentrations increased to a smaller degree from 1.6 times (IB) and 2.6 times (HC) to 3.4 times (IM). However, AC skin concentrations were not different between the two groups. Thus, percutaneous penetration parameters were equivocally influenced by SLS-induced irritation.

Conventional analytical methods frequently fail to selectively isolate and quantify trace amounts of these chemicals in complex plant matrices. This study introduces an optimized methodology for the analysis of pharmaceuticals in vegetables. The enhanced molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) approach investigates the extraction of selected pharmaceuticals, fenoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and gemfibrozil in vegetables. The extracted compounds were identified both qualitatively and quantitatively using a high-performance liquid phase chromatographic (HPLC) system coupled with a photodiode array detector. This method was effectively implemented on vegetable samples collected from Durban, South Africa (SA), including lettuce, carrot, cucumber, and green pepper. The recovery rates varied from 45% to 103%, with relative standard deviation (%RSD) ranging from 0.9% to 13%. Fenoprofen was the most prevalent compound, exhibiting high concentrations in pepper and cucumber, with maximum concentrations of 6.44 and 4.99 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The health index (HI) values for the vegetables ranged from 0.27 to 1.25. The pepper sample (1.25) surpassed the HI threshold value of 1, reflecting the health indicator risk associated with the consumption of peppers available within the area.

This leads to its discharge into the environment, causing considerable environmental concerns. The use of microorganisms has recently been recognized as a sustainable method for mitigating IBU contamination in wastewater. In this study, new bacteria capable of growing in a solid medium with IBU as the only carbon source and removing IBU from a liquid medium were isolated from environmental samples, including soil, marine, mine, and olive mill wastewater. Four bacterial strains, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae TIBU2.1, Klebsiella variicola LOIBU1.1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LOIBU1.2, and Mycolicibacterium aubagnense HPB1.1, were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These strains demonstrated significant IBU removal efficiencies, ranging from 60 to 100% within 14 days, starting from an initial IBU concentration of 5 mg per litre. These bacteria have not been previously reported in the literature as IBU degraders, making this work a valuable contribution to further studies in the field of bioremediation in environments contaminated by IBU. Based on the IBU removal results, the most promising bacteria, K. pneumoniae TIBU2.1 and M. aubagnense HPB1.1, were selected for an in silico analysis to identify genes potentially involved in IBU biodegradation. Interestingly, in the tests with TIBU2.1, a peak of IBU transformation product(s) was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography, while in the tests with HPB1.1, it was not detected. The emerging peak was analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, indicating the presence of possible conjugates between intermediates of IBU biodegradation. The proteins encoded on their whole-genome sequences were aligned with proteins involved in an IBU-degrading pathway reported in bacteria with respective catabolic genes. The analysis indicated that strain HPB1.1 possesses genes encoding proteins similar to most enzymes reported associated with the IBU metabolic pathways used as reference bacteria, while strain TIBU2.1 has genes encoding proteins similar to enzymes involved in both the upper and the lower part of that pathway. Notably, in the tests with the strain having more candidate genes encoding IBU-catabolic enzymes, no IBU transformation products were detected, while in the tests with the strain having fewer of these genes, detection occurred.",2024,,"Lara-Moreno A, Costa MC, Vargas-Villagomez A, Carlier JD.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.13320,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Carboxylate bioactivation into reactive metabolites (e.g., acyl glucuronides, AG) and resulting T-cell activation is hypothesized as causal for this adverse event. However, conclusive evidence supporting this is lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>In this work, we identify CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell hepatic infiltration in a biopsy from an IBU DILI patient. Lymphocyte transformation test and IFN-γ ELIspot, conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with NAP-DILI, were used to explore drug-specific T-cell activation. T-cell clones (TCC) were generated and tested for drug specificity, phenotype/function, and pathways of T-cell activation. Cells were exposed to NAP, its oxidative metabolite 6-O-desmethyl NAP (DM-NAP), its AG or synthesized NAP-AG human-serum albumin adducts (NAP-AG adduct).<h4>Results</h4>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from patients expressing a range of different Vβ receptors were stimulated to proliferate and secrete IFN-γ and IL-22 when exposed to DM-NAP, but not NAP, NAP-AG or the NAP-AG adduct. Activation of the CD4<sup>+</sup> TCC was HLA-DQ-restricted and dependent on antigen presenting cells (APC); most TCC were activated with DM-NAP-pulsed APC, while fixation of APC blocked the T-cell response. Cross-reactivity was not observed with structurally-related drugs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results confirm hepatic T-cell infiltrations in NSAID-induced DILI, and show a T-cell memory response toward DM-NAP indicating an immune-mediated basis for the adverse event.

The pathophysiological interplay between the heart and kidneys is defined as the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), in which worsening of kidney function is represented by increased plasma concentrations of uremic toxins (UTs), culminating in dialysis patients. As there is a high incidence of CVD in CKD patients, accompanied by arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, knowledge on electrophysiological remodeling would be instrumental for understanding the CRS. While the interplay between both organs is clearly of importance in CRS, the involvement of UTs in pro-arrhythmic remodeling is only poorly investigated, especially regarding the mechanistic background. Currently, the clinical approach against potential arrhythmic events is mainly restricted to symptom treatment, stressing the need for fundamental research on UT in relation to electrophysiology. This review addresses the existing knowledge of UTs and cardiac electrophysiology, and the experimental research gap between fundamental research and clinical research of the CRS. Clinically, mainly absorbents like ibuprofen and AST-120 are studied, which show limited safe and efficient usability. Experimental research shows disturbances in cardiac electrical activation and conduction after inducing CKD or exposure to UTs, but are scarcely present or focus solely on already well-investigated UTs. Based on UTs data derived from CKD patient cohort studies, a clinically relevant overview of physiological and pathological UTs concentrations is created.

NGF signals through tyrosine kinase receptors of the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family and the unrelated p75 receptor. PF-06273340 is a small molecule inhibitor of Trks A, B and C that reduces pain in nonclinical models, and the present study aimed to investigate the pharmacodynamics of this first-in-class molecule in humans.<h4>Methods</h4>A randomized, double-blind, single-dose, placebo- and active-controlled five-period crossover study was conducted in healthy human subjects (NCT02260947). Subjects received five treatments: PF-06273340 50 mg, PF-06273340 400 mg, pregabalin 300 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg and placebo. The five primary endpoints were the pain detection threshold for the thermal pain tests and the pain tolerance threshold for the cold pressor, electrical stair and pressure pain tests. The trial had predefined decision rules based on 95% confidence that the PF-06273340 effect was better than that of placebo.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty subjects entered the study, with 18 completing all five periods. The high dose of PF-06273340 met the decision rules on the ultraviolet (UV) B skin thermal pain endpoint [least squares (LS) mean vs. placebo: 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.64-1.61], but not on the other four primary endpoints. The low dose did not meet the decision criteria for any of the five primary endpoints.

To illustrate this, the stepwise development of an integrated disease/pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model of antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is presented along with therapy optimization suggestions.<h4>Method</h4>Published clinical trials, in vitro data, and drug physiochemical properties were used to develop an ibuprofen-mediated antipyresis model for febrile children also having CF. Workflow included first developing a mechanistic absorption model using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation followed by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. The verified PBPK model was then scaled to paediatric patients with CF. Once verified, the PBPK model was linked to an indirect response model of antipyresis for simulation of the overall antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen in CF children.<h4>Results</h4>Model simulations showed therapeutic inequivalence between healthy children and paediatric patients with CF; C<sub>max</sub> and AUC decreased by 39% (32-46%) and 44% (36-52%), respectively, in patients. Further, and in agreement with literature reports, predicted pharmacodynamics time courses suggest a slower onset and faster offset of action in patients compared to healthy children, 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Exploratory simulations suggest an increase in dosing frequency for CF children as a better therapeutic strategy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Model-informed approaches to leveraging knowledge obtained throughout the life cycle of drug development may play a key role in extrapolating drug efficacy and safety to underrepresented populations.",2020,,"Cicali B, Long T, Kim S, Cristofoletti R.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/bcp.14326,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Here, we investigated the role of three different NSAIDs (naproxen, ibuprofen and oxaprozin) on neutrophil responses to CXCL8 and C5a.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>Human neutrophils were isolated from healthy volunteers by dextran and Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients. Neutrophils were pre-incubated with different concentrations (1-100 µM) of NSAIDs or kinase inhibitors. Neutrophil degranulation into supernatants was tested by elisa and zymography. Neutrophil chemotaxis was determined using Boyden chambers. F-actin polymerization was determined by Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin fluorescent assay. Integrin expression was assessed by flow cytometry. The phosphorylation of intracellular kinases was studied by Western blot.<h4>Key results</h4>Pretreatment with NSAIDs did not affect neutrophil degranulation, but inhibited neutrophil migration and polymerization of F-actin, in response to CXCL8 and C5a. Pretreatment with different NSAIDs prevented C5a-induced integrin (CD11b) up-regulation, while only ibuprofen reduced CXCL8-induced CD11b up-regulation. Pre-incubation with naproxen or oxaprozin, but not ibuprofen, inhibited the PI3K/Akt-dependent chemotactic pathways. Both endogenous (released in cell supernatants) or exogenous (added to cell cultures) PGE2 did not affect C5a- or CXCL8-induced activities. Short-term incubation with NSAIDs did not affect neutrophil PGE2 release.<h4>Conclusion and implications</h4>Treatment with NSAIDs reduced C5a- and CXCL8-induced neutrophil migration and F-actin polymerization via different mechanisms. Inhibition by ibuprofen was associated with integrin down-regulation, while naproxen and oxaprozin blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway.

To date, the only anti-inflammatory drug available to CF patients is high-dose ibuprofen, which can slow pulmonary disease progression, but whose cyclooxygenase-dependent digestive adverse effects limit its clinical use. Here we have tested sulindac, another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with an undefined anti-inflammatory effect in CF airway epithelial cells.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>Using in vitro and in vivo models, we NF-κB activity and IL-8 secretion. In HeLa-F508del cells, we performed luciferase reporter gene assays in order to measure i) IL-8 promoter activity, and ii) the activity of synthetic promoter containing NF-κB responsive elements. We quantified IL-8 secretion in airway epithelial CFBE cells cultured at an air-liquid interface and in a mouse model of CF.<h4>Key results</h4>Sulindac inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and decreased IL-8 transcription and secretion in TNF-α stimulated CF cells via a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism. This effect was confirmed in vivo in a mouse model of CF induced by intra-tracheal instillation of LPS, with a significant decrease of the induction of mRNA for MIP-2, following treatment with sulindac.<h4>Conclusion and implications</h4>Overall, sulindac decrease lung inflammation by a mechanism independent of cycolooxygenase.

Eucalyptol interacts with the TRP cation channels among other targets, but it is unclear which of these mediates its anti-inflammatory effects.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>Effects of eucalyptol were compared in wild-type and TRPM8 channel-deficient mice in two different models: footpad inflammation elicited by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and pulmonary inflammation following administration of LPS. Oedema formation, behavioural inflammatory pain responses, leukocyte infiltration, enzyme activities and cytokine and chemokine levels were measured.<h4>Key results</h4>In the CFA model, eucalyptol strongly attenuated oedema and mechanical allodynia and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6), effects comparable with those of ibuprofen. In the LPS model of pulmonary inflammation, eucalyptol treatment diminished leukocyte infiltration, myeloperoxidase activity and production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ and IL-6. Genetic deletion of TRPM8 channels abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of eucalyptol in both models. Eucalyptol was at least sixfold more potent on human, than on mouse TRPM8 channels. A metabolite of eucalyptol, 2-hydroxy-1,8-cineol, also activated human TRPM8 channels.<h4>Conclusion and implications</h4>Among the pharmacological targets of eucalyptol, TRPM8 channels were essential for its anti-inflammatory effects in mice. Human TRPM8 channels are more sensitive to eucalyptol than rodent TRPM8 channels explaining the higher potency of eucalyptol in humans. Metabolites of eucalyptol could contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects.

MED,28542719,28542719,10.1111/bph.13867,Ibuprofen and diclofenac treatments reduce proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells upon inflammatory injury and mitogenic stimulation.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are administered to manage the pain typically found in patients suffering from pancreatitis. NSAIDs also display anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells; however, their effects on normal, untransformed cells are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated whether NSAIDs inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells during the development of acute pancreatitis.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>The NSAIDs ibuprofen and diclofenac were administered to C57BL/6 mice after induction of pancreatitis with serial injections of cerulein. In addition, ibuprofen was administered concomitantly with 3,5,3-L-tri-iodothyronine (T3), which induces acinar cell proliferation in the absence of tissue inflammation. The development of pancreatic inflammation, acinar de-differentiation into metaplastic lesions and acinar proliferation were quantified by histochemical, biochemical and RT-PCR approaches.<h4>Key results</h4>Therapeutic ibuprofen treatment selectively reduced pancreatic infiltration of activated macrophages in vivo, and M1 macrophage polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression both in vivo and in vitro. Reduced macrophage activation was accompanied by reduced acinar de-differentiation into acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. Acinar proliferation was significantly impaired in the presence of ibuprofen and diclofenac, as demonstrated at both the level of proliferation markers and expression of cell cycle regulators. Ibuprofen also reduced acinar cell proliferation induced by mitogenic stimulation with T3, a treatment that does not elicit pancreatic inflammation.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Our study provides evidence that the NSAIDs ibuprofen and diclofenac inhibit pancreatic acinar cell division. This suggests that prolonged treatment with these NSAIDs may negatively affect the regeneration of the pancreas and further studies are needed to confirm these findings in a clinical setting.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Inventing New Therapies Without Reinventing the Wheel: The Power of Drug Repurposing.

In animal experiments, 32 SD rats were randomly divided into the sham operation group, the chronic constrictive injury (CCI) group, the ibuprofen group, and the paeonol group. We performed behavioral testing, ELISA, PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The pseudotime analysis of microglia found that RhoA, Rock1, and p38MAPK were highly expressed in activated microglia, and the expression patterns of these genes were consistent with the expression trends of the M1 markers CD32 and CD86. Paeonol decreased the levels of M1 markers (IL1β, iNOS, CD32, IL6) and increased the levels of M2 markers (IL10, CD206, ARG-1) in LPS-induced microglia. The expression of iNOS, IL1β, RhoA, and Rock1 was significantly increased in LPS-treated microglia, while paeonol decreased the expression of these proteins.

After peripheral nerve injury, the mRNA expression levels of CSF1R pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages were increased in DRG. In vitro studies demonstrated that stigmasterol can reduce the secretion of IL-34 in LPS-induced RSC96 Schwann cells; stigmasterol treatment of LPS-induced Schwann cell-conditioned medium (L-S-CM) does not induce the proliferation and migration of RAW264.7 macrophages; L-S-CM reduces CSF1R signaling pathway (CSF1R, P38MAPK, and NFκB) activation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and ROS production. In vivo experiments have verified that stigmasterol can reduce thermal and cold hyperalgesia in rat chronic compressive nerve injury (CCI) model; stigmasterol can reduce IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, CCL2, SP, and PGE2 in serum of CCI rats; immunohistochemistry and western blot confirmed that stigmasterol can reduce the levels of IL-34/CSF1R signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in DRG of CCI rats.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Stigmasterol alleviates neuropathic pain by reducing Schwann cell-macrophage cascade in DRG by modulating IL-34/CSF1R axis.",2024,,"Si W, Chen Z, Bei J, Chang S, Zheng Y, Gao L, Zhao G, Li X, Zhang D.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.14657,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We hypothesized that NSAIDs may be delivered locally in a wound for heterotopic ossification prophylaxis. In in vitro work, we cultured osteoblasts with three commercially available NSAIDs and then measured cell viability and DNA content. Indomethacin caused a 50% decrease in DNA at the lowest dose (0.0001 mM) and the most potent decrease in cell viability (<10% of control at 0.0005 mM). Ketorolac and ibuprofen required 10 times the dose to achieve a comparable decrease (<20% of control at 0.005 mM). In an animal study, 20 rats per treatment group received a full-thickness wound dressed with either saline-moistened gauze, saline-moistened chitosan sponge, or chitosan sponge loaded with indomethacin. After 28 days, we examined the tissue for healing. Wounds exposed to indomethacin loaded sponges demonstrated fewer inflammatory cells. All 20 rats in the indomethacin group had complete epithelial coverage at 28 days. Eighteen (90%) wounds in the saline-chitosan group and 11 (55%) wounds in the saline-gauze group were healed.

Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included.<h4>Results</h4>Six clinical trials were included. No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections. Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms, but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections. In addition, it was found that clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir combination leads to decrease in mortality rate and duration of hospitalisation in patients with pneumonia caused by influenza.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence.

The aim of this study was to establish a simple and reliable experimental pain model that could distinguish the analgesic effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment from placebo in human volunteers. 2. The reproducibility and reliability over time of subject pain ratings was compared using cutaneous electrical stimuli applied to either the thenar eminence or the ear lobe at varying intensities and modes. Subjects were asked to respond firstly, when the stimulus became clearly sharp and painful ('first pain') and secondly, when the sensation became deep and burning and no further increase in stimulus intensity could be tolerated ('second pain'). 3. Constant voltage stimuli were found to be more reproducible than constant current stimuli. Both phasic (intermittent) and tonic (continuous) stimulation modalities produced 'first' and 'second pain' sensations.

It is well known that an individual subject often responds preferentially to a particular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and clinical response to these drugs is characterised by considerable variability between individuals. Variability in response has often been attributed to the episodic nature of musculoskeletal disease. Few studies have studied intrasubject variability in response to these drugs using a multiple crossover design. A major difficulty has been the lack of objective, validated measures of inflammation sensitive to NSAIDs. The primary aim of the present study was to test the utility of urate-crystal induced inflammation as a tool to predict NSAID response in humans. 2. An inflammatory reaction was established in twenty-five healthy subjects with intradermal injection of urate crystals on four separate occasions separated by 1 week. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive either ibuprofen on two of these occasions (800 mg four times over 36 h) or matched placebo on the other two occasions using a double-blind, cross-over design.

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a localized hyperalgesia model induced by cutaneous freeze injury to evaluate the pharmacodynamic profile of weak analgesic agents in healthy volunteers.<h4>Method and results</h4>Two groups of 24 healthy volunteers were enrolled in controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over studies. After freeze injury, punctate mechanical pain thresholds (MPT) were measured over three consecutive daily sessions to characterize the induced hyperalgesia and compare the effects of (i) oral ibuprofen and acetaminophen and (ii) oral and topical ibuprofen vs. placebo. The freeze injury model provides two types of hyperalgesia, primary and secondary, stable over 72 h. The MPT values (means; 95% confidence interval) in the primary (38.9 g; 34.3, 43.5) and secondary (82.2 g; 81.4, 88.0) areas of hyperalgesia were different from normal skin (107.5 g; 101.5, 115.2).

In September 2004, rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market as a result of concerns regarding its cardiovascular safety.<h4>Aims & methods</h4>We set out to examine the effect of the withdrawal of rofecoxib on the prescription of other COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) in Scotland, using a national prescription database.<h4>Results</h4>The withdrawal of rofecoxib led to an initial increase in the prescription of celecoxib as prescribers presumably switched to this alternative agent. However, this rise was short-lived, presumably as a result of concerns that the safety concerning rofecoxib may be a class effect. A parallel increase in the prescription of diclofenac and ibuprofen was also noted, suggesting that prescribers were prescribing these medications as alternatives to COX-2 inhibitors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While prescribers and their patients may have initially interpreted safety concerns regarding rofecoxib to be drug specific, prescribers appear to have interpreted this effect to be class specific.",2006,,"Williams D, Singh M, Hind C.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02691.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Cases of AMI were identified between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2000. Relative risk (RR) estimates for AMI in patients with no major clinical risk factors were determined for each NSAID according to number of prescriptions received compared with one prescription.

At the time of visit to the hospital, the children had fever; the cause of fever was determined to be URTI by a paediatrician based on history taking and physical examination. The study was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled parallel group, comparative, Phase 3 clinical trial, conducted at three hospitals. By using a computer-based random assignment program, the subjects were allocated to the following three groups: 5 mg kg(-1) dexibuprofen group, 7 mg kg(-1) dexibuprofen group, and 10 mg kg(-1) ibuprofen group.<h4>Results</h4>In the clinical trial of the antipyretic action of dexibuprofen in patients with fever caused by URTI, there was no statistically significant difference in maximal decrease of temperature and mean time to become apyrexial among the 5 mg kg(-1) dexibuprofen, 7 mg kg(-1) dexibuprofen and 10 mg kg(-1) ibuprofen groups (P > 0.05).

Inhibition of ALDO 18beta-glucuronidation was investigated using alclofenac, cicloprofen, diclofenac, diflunisal, fenoprofen, R- and S-ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid, S-naproxen, pirprofen and tiaprofenic acid. A rank order of inhibition (IC(50)) was established and the mechanism of inhibition investigated using diclofenac, S-ibuprofen, indomethacin, mefenamic acid and S-naproxen.<h4>Results</h4>ALDO 18beta-glucuronidation by hepatic and renal microsomes exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Mean (+/-SD) K(m), V(max) and CL(int) values for HLM and HKCM were 509 +/- 137 and 367 +/- 170 microm, 1075 +/- 429 and 1110 +/- 522 pmol min(-1) mg(-1), and 2.36 +/- 1.12 and 3.91 +/- 2.35 microl min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. Of the UGT proteins, only UGT1A10 and UGT2B7 converted ALDO to its 18beta-glucuronide. All NSAIDs investigated inhibited ALDO 18beta-G formation by HLM, HKCM and UGT2B7.

The drug concentration in the epidermis was measured by HPLC. All results were expressed as microgram drug/mg epidermal protein. The application time had no influence on the epidermal drug concentration, whereas the two gel formulations produced concentrations approximately twice those obtained with the emulsions. A significant positive correlation was found between the applied dose and the epidermal concentration for each formulation.

The effects of relevant concentrations of ibuprofen on cell viability and apoptosis were examined.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen at 10(-3) mol L(-1) significantly reduced TNF-alpha-stimulated migration of both cell types to that of nonstimulated cells (P < 0.001). TNF-alpha-unstimulated cell migration was not significantly affected. Cells responded similarly to SS and SR forms of ibuprofen. Cells treated with ibuprofen sodium salt-loaded hydrogels showed a significant reduction in migration when compared with unloaded hydrogels. Ibuprofen induced apoptosis in HBL cells but had no effect on C8161 melanoma cells apoptosis at concentrations that reduced migration.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results demonstrate that TNF-alpha upregulated malignant melanoma migration in vitro and that this could be reduced by ibuprofen both in solution and delivered from a hydrogel.

These features and their pharmacological modifications can be successfully studied in nasal challenge models. We performed a nasal allergen challenge followed by a rechallenge with allergen 24 h later in order to monitor changes in specific reactivity due to the initial allergen challenge. Symptoms were monitored, as was the generation of TAME-esterase activity in nasal lavage fluids. Prior to each challenge a nasal brush specimen was taken. In a double blind, cross-over, double-dummy manner the patients were pretreated with placebo, a single dose of 200 micrograms of budesonide (topical corticosteroid) given 2 h prior to rechallenge with allergen or 600 mg ibuprofen (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) given per os t.i.d. to steady state starting 24 h prior to the initial allergen challenge. Treatment with ibuprofen induced a slightly lower composite symptom score (P less than 0.05) at the initial allergen challenge when compared with placebo. No differences were noted in the relevant TAME-esterase activities. The allergen challenge resulted in significantly increased proportions of eosinophils in the brush specimens 24 h after the initial allergen challenge (P less than 0.001) with no differences between the different treatment alternatives.

In addition to the clinical history, diagnosis was confirmed by provocation to an alternative NSAID. Two groups were considered: (A) patients with cross-intolerance to NSAIDs and intolerance to paracetamol and (B) patients with cross-intolerance to NSAIDs and good tolerance to paracetamol. Etoricoxib was administered to Group A patients and to a representative sample of Group B patients. In the event of a positive response, serum tryptase levels were determined and skin biopsy was performed in five patients in each group.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen was the most commonly implicated drug, followed by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Urticaria was the most common manifestation, followed by angioedema. Most of the patients developed symptoms within 1 h. Twenty-five percent in Group A (n = 47) and 6% in Group B (n = 50) were intolerant to etoricoxib. Skin biopsy showed mast cell activation with the release of tryptase to the extracellular space but without the increase in serum tryptase levels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Selective COX-2 inhibitors may be unsafe in subjects with urticaria and/or angioedema caused by hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs with cross-intolerance if they are intolerant to paracetamol.

In isolated perfused rat liver, the time-course of volume-regulatory K+ efflux following exposure to hypoosmolar perfusate resembled the leukotriene-C4-induced K+ efflux in normotonic perfusion. Omission of Ca2+ from the perfusion fluid had no effect on volume-regulatory K+ efflux, but abolished completely the leukotriene-C4-induced K+ efflux. 2. Volume-regulatory K+ fluxes following hypoosmolar exposure (225 mOsmol l-1) and subsequent reexposure to normotonic media (305 mOsmol l-1) were not significantly affected by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (5 mumol l-1) or ibuprofen (50 mumol l-1), the leukotriene D4/C4-receptor antagonist 1-[2-hydroxy-3-propyl-4-[4-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]phenyl]etha none (YL 171883, 50 microM), the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 microM), the phospholipase-A2 inhibitor bromophenacyl bromide (50 microM) or the thromboxane-receptor antagonist 4-[2-(benzenesulfonamido)ethyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (BM 13.177, 20 microM). Also the effects of hypoosmotic cell swelling on lactate, pyruvate and glucose balance across the liver remained largely unaffected in presence of these inhibitors. Neither exposure of perfused rat liver to hypoosmolar (225 mOsmol l-1) nor to hyperosmolar (385 mOsmol l-1) perfusion media affected hepatic prostaglandin-D2 release. 3. When livers were 3H-labeled in vivo by an intraperitoneal injection of myo-[2-3H]inositol about 16 h prior to the perfusion experiment, cell swelling due to lowering the perfusate osmolarity from 305 mOsmol l-1 to 225 mOsmol l-1 led to about a threefold stimulation of [3H]inositol release. The maximum of hypotonicity-induced [3H]inositol release preceded maximal volume-regulatory K+ efflux by about 30 s, but came after the maximum of water shift into the cells. Hypotonicity-induced [3H]inositol release was largely prevented in presence of Li+ (10 mM), but simultaneously inositol monophosphate accumulated inside the liver within 10 min and a small, but significant increase of inositol trisphosphate 1 min after onset of hypoosmolar exposure was detectable. No stimulation of [3H]inositol release was observed during cell shrinkage by switching the perfusate osmolarity from 225 mOsmol l-1 to 305 mOsmol l-1 or from 305 mOsmol l-1 to 385 mOsmol l-1. No stimulation of [3H]inositol release was observed upon swelling of preshrunken livers by lowering the osmolarity from 385 mOsmol l-1 to 305 mOsmol l-1, although the volume-regulatory K+ efflux under these conditions was almost identical to that observed after lowering the osmolarity from 305 mOsmol l-1 to 225 mOsmol l-1. 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1991,,"vom Dahl S, Hallbrucker C, Lang F, Häussinger D.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15988.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Net K+ release roughly paralleled the amount of GSSG released from the liver under the influence of the hydroperoxide. The t-butylhydroperoxide-induced K+ efflux was inhibited by approximately 70% in the presence of Ba2+ (1 mM), by 30% in Ca(2+)-free perfusions and was decreased by 50-60% when the intracellular Ca2+ stores were simultaneously depleted by repeated additions of phenylephrine. t-Butylhydroperoxide-induced K+ efflux was accompanied by a decrease of the intracellular water space by 58 +/- 14 microliter/g (n = 4), corresponding to a 10% cell shrinkage. The effect of t-butylhydroperoxide on cell volume was inhibited by 70-80% in the presence of Ba2+. In isolated rat hepatocytes treatment with t-butylhydroperoxide led to a slight hyperpolarization of the membrane at concentrations of 100 nM, but marked hyperpolarization occurred at t-butylhydroperoxide concentrations above 10 microM. t-Butylhydroperoxide (0.2 mM) transiently increased the portal-perfusion pressure by 3.3 +/- 0.6 cm H2O (n = 18), due to a slight stimulation of prostaglandin-D2 release under the influence of the hydroperoxide. In the presence of Ba2+ (1 mM), t-butylhydroperoxide increased the perfusion pressure by 12.7 +/- 1.2 cm H2O (n = 9) and produced an approximately tenfold increase of prostaglandin-D2 and thromboxane-B2 release. Under these conditions, glucose output from the liver rose from 0.9 +/- 0.03 to 2.9 +/- 0.7 mumol.g-1.min-1 (n = 4) with a time course roughly resembling that of portal-pressure increase and prostaglandin-D2 overflow. These effects were largely abolished in the presence of ibuprofen or the thromboxane-receptor-antagonist BM 13.177. The t-butylhydroperoxide effects on perfusion pressure, glucose and eicosanoid output were also enhanced in the presence of insulin or during hypotonic exposure; i.e. conditions known to swell hepatocytes, but not during hyperosmotic exposure.

Ibuprofen (80 microM), indomethacin (50 microM) and meclofenamate (60 microM) all increased rates of glycogenolysis when added under basal conditions. In contrast, piroxicam (50 microM) had no effect on glycogenolysis in the hepatocyte system. Concentrations of ibuprofen below 80 microM did not significantly increase rates of glycogenolysis. Ibuprofen (80 microM) had no effect on glycogenolysis in the presence of 10(-5)M adrenaline or 5 X 10(-7)M glucagon, but did increase glycogenolytic rates in the presence of 5 X 10(-8)M glucagon. Ibuprofen-stimulated glycogenolysis was inhibited by addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Under conditions where glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis was inhibited by exogenous PGE2, addition of ibuprofen (80 microM) increased the rate of glycogenolysis. Ibuprofen had no effect on basal or glucagon-stimulated hepatocyte adenylate cyclase activity. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are carboxylic acids can increase the rate of glycogenolysis in isolated hepatocytes. The high concentrations of drug required to stimulate glycogenolysis, the lack of effect of piroxicam, and the demonstration of stimulation by ibuprofen in the presence of exogenous PGE2 all suggest that the stimulation of glycogenolysis by ibuprofen, indomethacin and meclofenamate is independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. These observations are consistent with reports that carboxylic acid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can interfere with hepatic intracellular calcium handling.",1985,,"Brass EP, Garrity MJ.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1985.tb08919.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Epidermal growth factor-urogastrone (EGF-URO) caused a concentration-dependent contractile response of longitudinal muscle strips from the gastric body of the guinea-pig stomach. The contractile response to EGF-URO was monophasic, with tension returning rapidly to baseline. Desensitization was evident in that further addition of EGF-URO to the organ bath did not cause a second contraction. 2. Preincubation with indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin markedly inhibited the contractions induced by EGF-URO with an order of potency (indomethacin greater than naproxen greater than ibuprofen greater than aspirin) that reflected the ability of these agents to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase. 3. The data indicate that prostanoids mediate the action of EGF-URO in the longitudinal muscle preparation. 4. Auranofin (0.5 to 50 microM), a chrysotherapeutic agent with antiproliferative properties used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, also markedly inhibited the EGF-URO response; however, other gold-containing compounds (aurothioglucose or gold sodium thiomalate at 30 to 100 microM) failed to cause significant inhibition. 5. Preincubation of preparations for 2 h with 1 microM hydrocortisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone caused an inhibition of EGF-URO-induced contraction of approximately 50%. However, steroids lacking either a 17 alpha-hydroxyl (corticosterone) or an 11 beta-hydroxyl (cortisone, deoxycorticosterone, prednisone) substituent did not inhibit the contraction caused by EGF-URO. For hydrocortisone, the inhibitory effect was half-maximal at 0.2 microM and was maximal at 1 microM. Cycloheximide (10 microM) blocked the inhibitory action of hydrocortisone and potentiated the contractile action of EGF-URO. 6. The ability of a variety of steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents to interfere with the action of EGF-URO in a smooth muscle preparation suggests that these agents may also inhibit the action of EGF-URO mediated by prostanoids in other target tissues. 7.

The characteristics of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-induced oedema formation were investigated in vivo in rabbit skin. 2. FMLP injected intradermally alone induced a small increase in plasma leakage, but marked synergism with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in producing oedema responses was observed. In the presence of PGE2, FMLP was equiactive with C5a des Arg and 100-1000 times more active than histamine in terms of permeability-increasing activity. The response to FMLP was not dependent on endogenous histamine release. 3. FMLP-induced responses were of long duration (t1/2 approximately 40-50 min) when compared with bradykinin (t1/2 approximately 4-5 min). 4. The activity of a range of N-formyl peptides in increasing vascular permeability in skin correlated well with their activity as neutrophil stimulants in vitro. 5. Intravenous infusion of zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) resulted in transient neutropenia and inhibition of oedema formation induced by FMLP and C5a des Arg in the skin. Responses to bradykinin were unaffected by the infusion of ZAP. 6. Intravenous injection of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, resulted in an inhibition of FMLP-induced, but not histamine-induced, oedema formation. This effect was independent of cyclo-oxygenase inhibition and the drug did not induced neutropenia. 7. Intravenous injection of the microtubule blocking agent colchicine inhibited FMLP-induced oedema formation. Responses to bradykinin were unaffected. When colchicine was administered after intradermal FMLP, subsequent plasma leakage was abolished. 8. The inference that receptors have evolved to bacterial secretions (i.e. FMLP) and products of the interaction of bacterial cell walls with tissue fluid (i.e. C5a des Arg), is consistent with the hypothesis that oedema formation is fundamentally a functional process concerned with regulating microbial lysis and opsonisation in an infected tissue.",1989,,"Hellewell PG, Yarwood H, Williams TJ.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1989.tb11940.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To obtain direct evidence of abnormal eicosanoid biosynthesis in rats injected with anti-glomerular-basement-membrane antibodies (a-GBM), products derived from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) were measured in 24 h urine collections before and after a-GBM. 2. Administration of a-GBM (9.5 mg) caused albuminuria, decreased creatinine clearance, increased numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and increased excretion of TXB2, 2,3-dinor-TXB2 (products of TXA2) and 6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha (products of PGI2) at 24 h. 3. Interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta; 5 micrograms) alone caused an increase in PGI2 metabolite excretion but had no effect on TXA2 metabolites. It had no effect on creatinine clearance but increased numbers of glomerular neutrophils by approximately 4-5 fold compared to a-GBM. 4. Pretreatment of rats with IL-1 beta before a-GBM synergistically increased albumin excretion but only additively increased eicosanoid excretion. Numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and creatinine clearance were unchanged compared to IL-1 beta alone. 5. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (10 mgkg-1 i.p., twice daily for 4 days) inhibited both serum TXB2 production and urinary prostaglandin excretion. It also caused an almost complete attenuation of albumin excretion. Creatinine clearance and glomerular neutrophils remained unchanged after a-GBM/IL-1 beta. 6. We conclude that the 50% inhibition of thromboxane production induced by ibuprofen does not modify the fall in creatinine clearance of accumulation of neutrophils in the glomerulus caused by the a-GBM. This degree of inhibition of eicosanoid production was associated with a striking decrease in proteinuria, but this may reflect a haemodynamic rather than a disease modifying action.",1991,,"Ward PS, Fuller RW, Ritter JM, Cashman SJ, Rees AJ, Dollery CT.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1991.tb09844.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The interaction of a new class of quinolone antimicrobials (new quinolones) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) with the GABAA receptor-Cl- channel complex was investigated in frog sensory neurones by use of the internal perfusion and 'concentration clamp' techniques. 2. The new quinolones and the NSAIDs (both 10(-6)-10(-5) M) had little effect on the GABA-induced chloride current (ICI) when applied separately. At a concentration of 10(-4) M the new quinolones, and to a lesser degree the NSAIDs, produced some suppression of the GABA response. 3. The co-administration of new quinolones and some NSAIDs (10(-6)-10(-14) M) resulted in a marked suppression of the GABA response. The size of this inhibition was dependent on the concentration of either the new quinolone or the NSAID tested. The inhibitory potency of new quinolones in combination with 4-biphenylacetic acid (BPAA) was in rank order norfloxacin (NFLX) much greater than enoxacin (ENX) greater than ciprofloxancin (CPFX) much greater than ofloxacin (OFLX), and that of NSAIDs in combination with ENX was BPAA much greater than indomethacin = ketoprofen greater than naproxen greater than ibuprofen greater than pranoprofen. Diclofenac, piroxicam and acetaminophen did not affect GABA responses in the presence of ENX. 4. In the presence of ENX or BPAA, there was a small shift to the right of the concentration-response curve for GABA without any effect on the maximum response. However, the co-administration of these drugs suppressed the maximum of the GABA concentration-response curve, indicating a non-competitive inhibition, for which no voltage-dependency was observed.5. Simultaneous administration of ENX and BPAA also suppressed pentobarbitone (PB)-gated Icl. On the other hand, both PB and phenobarbitone reversed the inhibition of GABA-induced Ic, by coadministration of ENX and BPAA.6. The effect on GABAA responses of co-administration of new quinolones and NSAIDs was not via an interaction with benzodiazepine receptors coupled to the GABAA receptor, since this effect was not reversed by Rol5-1788 or diazepam.7.

We have investigated the effects of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on nociception during ischaemia and on reperfusion hyperalgesia in rats. 2. We induced tail ischaemia in conscious rats by applying a tourniquet at the base of the tail until the rats exhibited co-ordinated escape behaviour when we released the tourniquet. 3. We assessed hyperalgesia by measuring the tail flick latency following tail immersion in water at 49 degrees C, before applying and immediately after releasing the tourniquet, and then at 30 min intervals for 2 h. 4. Intraperitoneal injection of NSAIDs prior to applying the tourniquet had no effect on the co-ordinated escape behaviour during ischaemia, nor on tail flick latency in the absence of prior ischaemia. However all the drugs attenuated reperfusion hyperalgesia in a log dose-dependent manner. Doses required to abolish hyperalgesia, were indomethacin 5 mg kg-1, diclofenac sodium 42 mg kg-1, ibuprofen 54 mg kg-1, dipyrone 168 mg kg-1 and paracetamol 170 mg kg-1. 5.

The cytoprotection provided by iloprost was compared with that of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. 2 Treatment of hepatocytes with either NABQI (0.4 mM) or paracetamol (2 mM) alone resulted in a considerable loss of cell viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion or leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, accompanied by an increase in the percentage of viable cells that were blebbed. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (1.25 mM) pretreatment diminished the loss of cell viability and the percentage of blebbed cells resulting from exposure to NABQI or paracetamol, whereas iloprost (10(-16) M to 10(-10) M) pretreatment reduced only the loss of cell viability, not the percentage of viable cells exhibiting blebbing. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly attenuated the depletion by paracetamol of glutathione and decreased the covalent binding of [14C]-paracetamol to cellular proteins, whereas iloprost was without any such effects. 3 The effects of iloprost and N-acetyl-L-cysteine were also investigated by use of a model of paracetamol toxicity in which it is possible to study the biochemical events leading to cell injury separate from the generation of toxic metabolites. Hamster hepatocytes were incubated with paracetamol (4 mM) for 90 min at 37 degrees C during which metabolism of paracetamol occurs with minimal loss of cell viability. Following washing of cells, to remove paracetamol and its metabolites, there was a progressive loss of viability and increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting blebbing when incubated in buffer alone. Addition of either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (1.25 mM) or iloprost (10 14M to 10 -M), following washing, significantly reduced the expected loss of cell viability. Iloprost at concentrations outside this range was without effect.4. Paracetamol toxicity to isolated hepatocytes could be prevented or delayed by treatment with either N-acetyl-L-cysteine or iloprost, but whereas the former prevented or even reversed plasma membrane blebbing with a resultant reduction in the percentage of viable cells that were blebbed, the prostanoid appeared only to delay the progression from plasma membrane blebbing to loss of viability. Hence, the percentage of viable cells that were ultimately blebbed following exposure to paracetamol was not significantly reduced by addition of iloprost.5. Aspirin or ibuprofen exacerbated the loss of viability induced by prior incubation with paracetamol. Thus, there may be a role for endogenous prostaglandins in protecting hepatocytes from paracetamol toxicity.6. Iloprost is cytoprotective without any effect upon toxin metabolism or detoxication. The mechanism of action of iloprost probably does not involve induction of prostaglandin synthesis or activation of the previously-characterized prostacyclin receptor.",1992,,"Nasseri-Sina P, Fawthrop DJ, Wilson J, Boobis AR, Davies DS.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14268.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In endothelium-intact canine coronary artery, contracted with the thromboxane A2-analogue, U46619, WGA relaxed the tissue in a concentration-dependent manner, with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 112 +/- 17 nM (n = 6). In the absence of an endothelium, WGA did not cause any relaxation of the tissue. 3. In endothelium-intact canine coronary artery, contracted with the thromboxane A2-analogue, U46619. LCA relaxed the tissue in a concentration-dependent manner, with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 423.1 +/- 41 nM (n = 6). In the absence of an endothelium, LCA produced a 20.1 +/- 1.1% (n = 6) relaxation at the highest concentration tested (3 microM). 4. Concanavalin A (Con A) relaxed canine coronary artery in a partial endothelium-dependent manner with an IC50 of 104 +/- 19 nM on endothelium-intact coronary artery and an IC50 of 1.3 +/- 0.3 microM (n = 6) on endothelium-denuded tissues. 5.

In the absence of extracellular calcium, WGA was also able to release EDRF suggesting that WGA acts through a second messenger system to release intracellular calcium.9.

The present study was conducted in order to examine the effects of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, TCV-309, and the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, on the acute haemodynamic responses to endotoxin in anaesthetized dogs. 2. Endotoxin (2 mg kg-1, i.v.) induced a severe hypotension by decreasing both total peripheral resistance (TPR) and cardiac output. Endotoxin also decreased central venous pressure and increased effective vascular compliance (EVC), indicating a blood pooling in the capacitance vessels. 3. The endotoxin-induced hypotension but not the fall in cardiac output, was markedly attenuated by ibuprofen. Ibuprofen abolished the decrease in TPR and even caused a systemic vasoconstriction. Ibuprofen abolished the increase in EVC. 4. The hypotension caused by endotoxin was attenuated by TCV-309 to a lesser extent than ibuprofen. However, the reduction in cardiac output produced by endotoxin was markedly attenuated by the PAF antagonist. TCV-309 also abolished the increase in EVC. In contrast to ibuprofen, TCV-309 did not affect the decrease in TPR caused by endotoxin. 5. Combined treatment with ibuprofen and TCV-309 markedly attenuated the endotoxin-induced hypotension, but not the fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, when compared with animals treated with ibuprofen alone, treatment with ibuprofen and TCV-309 partly attenuated the endotoxin-induced reduction in cardiac output and systemic vasoconstriction. 6. These data indicate that dilatation of both resistance vessels and capacitance vessels contributes to the endotoxin-induced hypotension. It is suggested that (i) both prostanoids and PAF are involved in dilatation of capacitance vessels, (ii) prostanoids, but not PAF cause dilatation of resistance vessels and(iii) PAF may partly contribute to prostanoid-independent reduction in cardiac output in acute canine experimental endotoxin shock.",1993,,"Yamanaka S, Iwao H, Yukimura T, Kim S, Miura K.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2175868?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Oedema formation in skin is dependent on a synergism between mediators that increase vascular permeability and mediators that enhance local blood flow. Leukocyte accumulation is also enhanced by mediators that increase local blood flow. In this study, we have investigated whether nitric oxide (NO), an important endogenous vasodilator, could modulate oedema formation and leukocyte accumulation in guinea-pig skin. 2. Local administration of the NO synthesis inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), dose-dependently inhibited the oedema formation induced in response to intrademal injection of bradykinin or histamine. L-NAME, but not NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (D-NAME); also inhibited oedema formation in response to i.d. injection of platelet-activating factor (PAF), zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) and in a passive cutaneous anaphylactic (PCA) reaction. 3. N-iminoethyl-L-ornithine (L-NIO) was less effective and about 100 times less potent than L-NAME in inhibiting bradykinin-induced oedema formation. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, had little effect on oedema responses induced by bradykinin, PAF and in a PCA reaction. On the other hand, histamine-induced oedema formation was significantly suppressed by ibuprofen. 4. The inhibition by L-NAME of bradykinin-induced oedema formation was reversed by co-injection of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). 5. L-NAME inhibited 111In-eosinophil and 111In-neutrophil accumulation induced by i.d. injection of ZAP. 111In-eosinophil accumulation induced by PAF and in the PCA reaction was also inhibited by L-NAME but not by D-NAME. 6. Co-injection of SNP or PGE1, reversed the inhibition by L-NAME of ZAP-induced oedema formation and 111In-neutrophil accumulation. SNP, but not PGE1, also reversed the effects of L-NAME on ZAP-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation.7. L-NAME caused a significant decrease in basal cutaneous blood flow when injected alone or with bradykinin. Again, SNP or PGE, reversed the effects of L-NAME suggesting that the inhibitory action of L-NAME on oedema formation and cell accumulation was due to an inhibition of vasodilator tone in the microcirculation.8. Thus, it appears that in guinea-pig skin the inhibition of the production of endogenous NO inhibits both leukocyte accumulation and oedema formation induced by different mediators of inflammation.Since administration of L-NAME also causes a local decrease in basal blood flow, we suggest that this is the mechanism by which it exerts anti-inflammatory effects in this model.",1993,,"Teixeira MM, Williams TJ, Hellewell PG.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1993.tb13994.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Leukotrienes have potent biological effects in vitro and in vivo and are found in tissue and in biological fluids in various pathological conditions including allergic diseases. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent stimulus for eosinophil accumulation and activation and there is much interest in determining its importance in mediating the accumulation of eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation in vivo. In this study, we investigated the effects of a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, ZM 230487, on the accumulation of eosinophils and on local oedema formation in cutaneous inflammation in the guinea-pig. 2. The i.d. injection of increasing concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA) led to a dose-dependent accumulation of 111In-eosinophils but oedema formation was only significant at the top dose of AA tested (3 x 10(-8) mol per site). Co-injection of ZM 230487 with AA inhibited 111In-eosinophil accumulation up to 99% but the small oedema response to AA was only partially inhibited. AA-induced oedema formation was only effectively inhibited when a combination of a PAF antagonist, an antihistamine and ZM 230487 was used. 3. Local administration of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, partially inhibited AA-induced oedema formation suggesting that vasodilator prostaglandins may be released following i.d. injection of AA. AA-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation was also partially inhibited by ibuprofen. 4. PAF-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation was partially suppressed by local administration of ZM 230487. In contrast, LTB4-induced 111In-eosinophil accumulation was enhanced by ZM 230487. These data suggest that locally-released leukotrienes may modulate mediator-induced eosinophil accumulation. ZM 230487 had no effect on PAF- or LTB4-induced oedema formation. 5. ZM230487 significantly inhibited the accumulation of 111 In-eosinophils, but did not affect local oedema formation, in a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction.

In the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig taenia caeci, bradykinin produces a relaxation followed by a contraction. In the presence of hexamethonium and guanethidine, both these phases of the response were insensitive to tetrodotoxin (100 nM), omega-conotoxin GVIA (100 nM) and ibuprofen (1 microM), suggesting that they are due to a direct action on the smooth muscle. 2. The B1 receptor-selective agonist, [des-Arg9]-BK (1-100 microM), was inactive in the taenia caeci, and the B1 receptor-selective antagonist, [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK (1-10 microM), did not inhibit either phase of the bradykinin-induced response. The B2 receptor-selective antagonist, D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK (Hoe 140) (30-300 nM), inhibited both the bradykinin-induced relaxation and contraction with a similar affinity (apparent pKB estimates of 8.5 +/- 0.1 and 8.4 +/- 0.1 respectively). 3. In a depolarizing high-K(+)-solution, bradykinin produced concentration-related contractions, though of diminished magnitude; but no relaxation was observed in such media. In Krebs solution, the Ca(2+)-activated K(+)-channel blocker, apamin (10 nM), abolished relaxant responses. These observations suggest that contraction results both from membrane potential-dependent, and membrane potential-independent, mechanisms; whereas relaxant responses result entirely from membrane potential-dependent mechanisms. Contractile responses obtained in the high K(+)-solution were inhibited by D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK with an apparent pKB value of 8.4 +/- 0.1. 4. In a Ca(2+)-free, EGTA-containing medium, relatively high concentrations of bradykinin (> 100 nM) produced transient contractions, suggesting that a component of the contractile response results from release of Ca2+ from an intracellular store. This intracellular Ca2+ store could be refilled in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The B, receptor antagonist, [Leu8,des-Argj-BK (10 micro M), did not inhibit this bradykinin-induced contraction, whereas the B2 receptor antagonist, D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK(100 nM) markedly attenuated it (P<0.001; n = 6).5. Bradykinin (10 nM- 100 micro M) significantly elevated tissue levels of total [3H]-inositol phosphates in the presence of Li?, after incubation with myo-[3H]-inositol. The B, receptor-selective agonist, [des-Argl-BK(100IM) did not stimulate [3H]-inositol phosphate formation, and the B, receptor-selective antagonist,[Leu8,des-Argl-BK, did not inhibit the formation of [3H]-inositol phosphates in response to a submaximal concentration of bradykinin (1I0 1M; P> 0.05). Two B2 receptor antagonists, D-Arg-[Hyp3,DPhe7]-BK and D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK, inhibited bradykinin-induced accumulation of total[3H]-inositol phosphates with apparent pKB estimates of 5.4 +/0 0.3 and 8.4 +/- 0.1, respectively.6. These data suggest that in the guinea-pig taenia caeci, the five aspects of the action of bradykinin studied (the relaxant and the contractile elements of the biphasic mechanical response, the contractile response in a depolarizing high-K' solution medium and zero-Ca2+ media, and stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover), all result from activation of B2 receptors. A possible causal relationship is suggested between these B2 receptor-mediated membrane potential-dependent, and -independent events,and their roles in excitation contraction coupling.",1994,,"Field JL, Butt SK, Morton IK, Hall JM.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1510129?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The mechanisms underlying bradykinin (BK)-mediated contractions in strips of guinea-pig gallbladder (GPG) were examined by use of selective bradykinin (BK) receptor agonists and antagonists. 2. Addition of BK and related kinins (0.1 pM-10 microM) after 2 h of equilibration of the preparation caused graded contractions characterized by two distinct phases: high affinity (0.1 pM-1 nM) and low affinity (3 nM-10 microM). The rank order of potency for the first phase (mean EC50, pM) was: BK (1.36) = Hyp3-BK (1.44) = Lys-BK (1.54) > Tyr8-BK (2.72) > Met-Lys-BK (4.30). The rank order of potency for the second phase (mean EC50, nM, at concentration producing 50% of the contraction caused by 80 mM KCl) was: Hyp3-BK (8.95) > Met-Lys-BK (12.78) > Tyr8-BK (33.75) > Lys-BK caused by 80 mM KCl) was: Hyp3-BK (8.95) > Met-Lys-BK (12.78) > Tyr8-BK (33.75) > Lys-BK (60.92) > BK (77.35). The contractile responses (g of tension) to 3 microM of BK (the highest concentration tested) were: Hyp3-BK, 1.76 +/- 0.09; BK, 1.65 +/- 0.12; Lys-BK, 1.45 +/- 0.13; Tyr8-BK, 1.36 +/- 0.15 and Met-Lys-BK, 1.36 +/- 0.15. The selective B1 agonist, des-Arg9-BK, caused only a weak contraction with maximal response (0.21 +/- 0.05 g), which corresponded to approximately 10% of that induced by BK. 3. BK-induced contraction in GPG was inhibited by indomethacin (3 microM) or ibuprofen (30 microM), and was partially reduced by phenidone (30 microM), but was not affected by atropine (1 JM), nicardipine (1 gM),Ca2+-free medium plus EGTA, dazoxiben (30 nM), L-655,240 (10 nM, a selective receptor antagonist ofthromboxane A2), MK-571 (0.1 microM, a selective leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist), tetrodotoxin(0.3microM), CP 96,345 (0.3 microM, a NK1 receptor antagonist), mepyramine (1 microM), glibenclamide (1 microM), H-7(3 microM), staurosporine (100 nM), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 microM). However, BK-induced contractions in GPG maintained in Ca2+-free medium were markedly attenuated by ryanodine (10microM).4. Prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2alpha or U46619 (0.1 nM to 100microM), caused concentration-dependent contractions in GPG with mean EC50s of 3.1 microM; 1.7 microM and 0.47 nM and maximal responses of1.36 +/-0.15; 1.32 +/- 0.20 and 0.96 +/- 0.09 g, respectively.5. The selective B2 receptor antagonists, Hoe 140, NPC 17731 and NPC 17761 (0.01 -1 microM), caused concentration-dependent displacements to the right of the contractile concentration-response curve for BK. The selective B1 receptor antagonist, des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (1 microM), did not affect BK-induced GPG contraction.6. These data suggest that both high and low affinity BK responses in GPG are mediated by activation of B2 receptors, and that BK-mediated contraction in GPG depends on the release of intracellular Ca2+sources sensitive to ryanodine. In addition, BK-induced contraction in GPG is mediated by release of proinflammatory eicosanoid(s) derived from the cyclo-oxygenase pathway from arachidonic acid metabolism unrelated to thromboxane A2, and seems not to be coupled to activation of a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism.",1995,,"Cabrini DA, Silva AM, Calixto JB.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1995.tb14938.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Thapsigargin stimulated the accumulation of cell-associated platelet-activating factor (PAF) and extracellular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in rat peritoneal macrophages. PAF in the conditioned medium was less than the detectable amount. To obtain further insight into the mechanism of PAF accumulation, the role of PGE2 in PAF accumulation was investigated. 2. When macrophages were incubated in medium containing thapsigargin (30 ng ml(-1), 46.1 nM) and cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin, naproxen or ibuprofen, the PAF content of the cells at 10 min was increased in a concentration-dependent manner in accordance with inhibition of PGE2 production. The stimulation by thapsigargin, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors did not increase PAF accumulation. 3. In thapsigargin-stimulated macrophages, when PGE2(10(-7) M) was added to the medium, the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor-induced stimulation of PAF accumulation at 10 min was markedly inhibited. 4. The accumulation of PAF induced by thapsigargin alone at 10 min was inhibited by exogenous PGE2 (10(-8) and 10(-7) M), or arachidonic acid (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) in accordance with the increase in PGE2 production. 5. The accumulation of PAF induced by thapsigargin alone or by thapsigargin and indomethacin (10(-6) M) was inhibited by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. 6.

Our objective was to determine whether endotoxin (ETX) could directly trigger the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from perivascular sensory nerves in the isolated mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) of the rat and to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PGs) are involved. 2. ETX caused time- and concentration-dependent release of CGRP, and as much as a 17 fold increase in CGRP levels in the perfusate at 10-15 min after the administration of ETX (50 micrograms ml-1). 3. CGRP-like immunoreactivity in the perfusate was shown to co-elute with synthetic rat CGRP by reverse-phase h.p.l.c. 4. Pretreatment of MAB with capsaicin or ruthenium red inhibited ETX-induced CGRP release by 90% and 71%, respectively. ETX-evoked CGRP release was decreased by 84% during Ca2(+)-free perfusion. 5. The release of CGRP evoked by ETX was enhanced by L-arginine by 43% and inhibited by N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) and methylene blue by 37% and 38%, respectively. L-Arginine reversed the effect of L-NOARG. 6. Indomethacin and ibuprofen also inhibited the ETX-induced CGRP release by 34% and 44%, respectively. No additive inhibition could be found when L-NOARG and indomethacin were concomitantly incubated. 7. The data suggest that ETX triggers the release of CGRP from capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves innervating blood vessels. The ETX-induced CGRP release is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ influx and involves a ruthenium red-sensitive mechanism.

Twenty-one wild-type mice received standard diet.<h4>Key results</h4>Compared with transgenic controls, CHF5074 treatment significantly reduced the area occupied by plaques in cortex (P = 0.003) and hippocampus (P = 0.004). The number of plaques were also reduced by CHF5074 in both cortex (P = 0.022) and hippocampus (P = 0.005).

This raised the possibility that other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and especially ibuprofen, could also interact with hPEPT1. Here, we have assessed the interactions of ibuprofen with hPEPT1.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>The uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar, [(3)H]Ibuprofen and other radio-labelled compounds were investigated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK)/hPEPT1, MDCK/Mock, LLC-PK(1) or Caco-2 cells. The transepithelial transport of ibuprofen and hPEPT1 substrates was investigated in Caco-2 cell monolayers.<h4>Key results</h4>Ibuprofen concentration dependently inhibited hPEPT1-mediated uptake of Gly-Sar in MDCK/hPEPT1 cells (K(i)(app) = 0.4 mM) but uptake of ibuprofen in Caco-2 cells and MDCK/hPEPT1 cells was not inhibited by hPEPT1 substrates. The maximum uptake rate for Gly-Sar uptake was reduced from 522 pmol·min(-1)·cm(-2) to 181 pmol·min(-1)·cm(-2) and 78 pmol·min(-1)·cm(-2) in the presence of 0.5 mM and 1 mM ibuprofen, respectively. The interaction between ibuprofen and hPEPT1 was thus non-competitive. In LLC-PK1 cells, ibuprofen (1 mM) did not influence the transporter-mediated uptake of glycine or α-methyl-D-glycopyranoside. In Caco-2 cell monolayers the absorptive transport of δ-aminolevulinic acid was reduced by 23% and 48% by ibuprofen (1 and 10 mM), respectively. Likewise the transport of Gly-Sar was reduced by 23% in the presence of ibuprofen (1 mM).<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Ibuprofen is a non-competitive inhibitor of hPEPT1.

Here, we investigated the use of nanocarriers to improve its pharmacokinetics (PKs) and anti tumour efficacy.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of P-I encapsulated into liposomes and micelles, and its in vitro metabolic stability, were determined in cultures of human colon adenocarcinoma cells. The performance of liposomal P-I was further evaluated in PK studies in mice, and in a model of colon cancer xenografts in nude mice.<h4>Key results</h4>Liposomal P-I and micellar P-I showed significantly enhanced cellular uptake in the colon cancer cells. Liposomal P-I also demonstrated increased cytotoxicity in vitro. Free P-I was metabolized rapidly to ibuprofen in the presence of purified esterases. In contrast, liposomal P-I, and to a lesser extent micellar P-I, was resistant to esterase-mediated hydrolysis. In mice, liposomal P-I partially protected P-I from hydrolysis in the circulation, and improved the biodistribution of intact P-I and its metabolites compared to free P-I. Liposomal P-I was more effective at inhibiting the growth of human colon cancer xenografts in mice, which may be explained on the basis of its improved PK profile compared to free P-I.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Liposome encapsulation of P-I partially protected P-I from esterase-mediated hydrolysis in mice, enhanced the cytotoxicity and bioavailability of P-I and increased its efficacy at inhibiting the growth of human colon cancer xenografts.

Sixty-two clinical isolates and five control strains of C. albicans were studied: the azole susceptibility phenotype was determined according to the Clinical Laboratory for Standards Institute, M27-A2 protocol and minimal inhibitory concentration values were recalculated with ibuprofen (100 microg mL(-1)); synergistic studies between fluconazole and FK506, a Cdr1p inhibitor, were performed using an agar disk diffusion assay and were compared with ibuprofen results. Gene expression was quantified by real-time PCR, with and without ibuprofen, regarding CDR1, CDR2, MDR1, encoding for efflux pumps, and ERG11, encoding for azole target protein. A correlation between susceptibility phenotype and resistance gene expression profiles was determined. Ibuprofen and FK506 showed a clear synergistic effect when combined with fluconazole. Resistant isolates reverting to susceptible after incubation with ibuprofen showed CDR1 and CDR2 overexpression especially of the latter.

We tested the hypotheses that ICCs express cyclooxygenase (COX), and that COX products (prostaglandins), are the cause of spontaneous rhythmic contraction (SRC) of isolated strips of rabbit bladder free of urothelium. SRC was abolished by 10 microM indomethacin and ibuprofen (non-selective COX inhibitors). SRC was concentration-dependently inhibited by selective COX-1 (SC-560 and FR-122047) and COX-2 inhibitors (NS-398 and LM-1685), and by SC-51089, a selective antagonist for the PGE-2 receptor (EP) and ICI-192,605 and SQ-29,548, selective antagonists for thromboxane receptors (TP). The partial agonist/antagonist of the PGF-2alpha receptor (FP), AL-8810, inhibited SRC by approximately 50%. Maximum inhibition was approximately 90% by SC-51089, approximately 80-85% by the COX inhibitors and approximately 70% by TP receptor antagonists. In the presence of ibuprofen to abolish SRC, PGE-2, sulprostone, misoprostol, PGF-2alpha and U-46619 (thromboxane mimetic) caused rhythmic contractions that mimicked SRC. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that c-Kit and vimentin co-localized to interstitial cells surrounding detrusor smooth muscle bundles, indicating the presence of extensive ICCs in rabbit bladder. Co-localization of COX-1 and vimentin, and COX-2 and vimentin by ICCs supports the hypothesis that ICCs were the predominant cell type in rabbit bladder expressing both COX isoforms. These data together suggest that ICCs appear to be an important source of prostaglandins that likely play a role in regulation of SRC.

In order to measure the effect of CBZ-phe-met, one needs a repeat-able, quantitative, easily obtainable standard measurement of the edema formation. In this study, a caliper designed for measuring soft materials was used to evaluate the edema, induced by croton oil on rabbit ears, as well as the effects of CBZ-phe-met.<h4>Methods</h4>The model used in this study was croton-induced inflammation on rabbit ears. A caliper for measuring soft materials (European standard DIN 863 part 3, manufactured by TESA Ltd., Renens, Switzerland) was used to evaluate the edema, which is part of the inflammatory effect. The action of CBZ-phe-met and two other anti-inflammatory agents; hydrocortisone and Na-ibuprofen, were compared.<h4>Results</h4>CBZ-phe-met 1-5% was found to reduce the edema on rabbit ears induced by croton oil by 15 to 93%. 5% CBZ-phe-met was found to be as effective as 5% Na-ibuprofen and 0.1% hydrocortisone.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The caliper for soft materials was found to be suitable for measuring the edema induced by croton-oil, as well as the reducing edema due to anti-inflammatory treatment. It was also found that CBZ-phe-met is a potent topical anti-inflammatory agent in the croton-oil-induced inflammatory model.

Twelve patients were randomised to ibuprofen-foam and 12 patients to local best practice. The study population consisted of patients with chronic, painful exudating leg ulcers. The patients rated their wound pain intensity at baseline and after the first dressing application. Pain intensity in the morning and evening was rated during a period of 1 week using a numeric box scale (NBS). A t-test compared the main differences in pain intensity and a five-point verbal rating scale measured the patients' pain relief. At the last clinical visit, pain after dressing change was assessed using an NBS. In addition, wound size, percentage of healthy granulation tissue and the presence of peri-ulcer erythema, were (all) evaluated at inclusion and the end of the study. The nurses and patients both evaluated the relative dressing performance and exudate management at the last study visit. This study demonstrates that the ibuprofen-foam dressing decreased wound pain in patients with leg ulcers compared to best practice.

A multinational and multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical investigation of 122 patients compared two moist wound-healing dressings, a non adhesive foam dressing with ibuprofen (62 patients randomised to Biatain-Ibu non adhesive, Coloplast A/S) with a non adhesive foam without ibuprofen (60 to Biatain non adhesive). The ibuprofen-foam was regarded successful, if the pain relief on a 5-point verbal rating scale was higher than the comparator without compromising safety, including appropriate healing rate. Additional endpoints were change in persistent wound pain between dressing changes and pain at dressing change on days 1-5 and days 43-47. The primary response variable, persistent pain relief, was significantly higher in the ibuprofen-foam group compared with the comparator on days 1-5, with a quick onset of action (P < 0.05). The patients in the ibuprofen-foam group had a significant (P < 0.05) higher reduction in the persistent wound pain from baseline (40%) as the comparator (30%). Women reported less pain intensity than men, and pain intensity decreased with increasing age. In addition, pain intensity increased with increasing initial pain intensity and increasing wound size. Wound healing was similar in the ibuprofen-foam group to that of the comparator group.

To analyse the effect on new blood vessel growth, implants from Biatain Ibu, a polyurethane foam containing ibuprofen, were inserted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of BALB/c mice. Implants from ibuprofen-free polyurethane foam Biatain served as controls (n = 10 per group). Blood vessel growth and the functional vessel density (FVD) as a parameter for microvascularization of implant's border zone were assessed by intravital fluorescence microscopy (IVFM). IVFM was performed on days 3, 7 and 12 after implantation. Direct comparison showed no significant differences in FVD (mm/mm(2)) for the border zone of the ibuprofen-releasing implants versus controls on day 3 (185.49 +/- 4.75 versus 197.17 +/- 5.21) and day 7 (229.60 +/- 8.53 versus 247.99 +/- 5.39).

Increased dosage did not produce a proportional increase in the permeation and maximizing the skin-drug contact did not increase penetration: both factors indicate that absorption from deposited drug films was dissolution rate-limited. Occlusion of the skin did not increase the dissolution rate of the deposited drug film, but did elevate the penetration of drug already present within the skin at the time of occlusion. The diffusion coefficients for both drugs were calculated by two methods, yielding 1.8 +/- 1.3 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 and 1.0 +/- 0.56 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 for ibuprofen and 1.9 +/- 0.59 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 and 0.77 +/- 0.23 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 for flurbiprofen. Increasing the acetone-skin contact time from 2 min to 2 h did not significantly alter the permeability of the skin. Absorption of flurbiprofen was similar from 10 and 100% saturated aqueous solutions, suggesting that the skin has a limited capacity for flurbiprofen transport beyond which further increase in drug penetration may be difficult.

The molecular packing of these various systems was also investigated in Langmuir monolayer studies.<h4>Key findings</h4>Loading and release of drugs within the liposome bilayer was shown to be influenced by their cholesterol content: increasing cholesterol content was shown to reduce drug incorporation and inclusion of cholesterol in the bilayer changed the release profile of propofol from zero-order, for phosphatidyl choline only liposomes, to a first-order model when 11 to 33 total molar % of cholesterol was present in the formulation. At higher bilayer concentrations substitution of cholesterol with tetradecanol was shown to have less of a detrimental impact on bilayer drug loading. However, the presence of cholesterol within the liposome bilayer was shown to reduce drug release compared with fatty alcohols. Monolayer studies undertaken showed that effective mean area per molecule for a 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC):cholesterol mixture deviated by 9% from the predicted area compared with 5% with a similar DSPC:tetradecanol mixture. This evidence, combined with cholesterol being a much more bulky structure, indicated that the condensing influence of tetradecanol was less compared with cholesterol, thus supporting the reduced impact of tetradecanol on drug loading and drug retention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Liposomes can be effectively formulated using fatty alcohols as an alternative bilayer stabiliser to cholesterol. The general similarities in the characteristics of liposomes containing fatty alcohols or cholesterol suggest a common behavioural influence for both compounds within the bilayer.",2010,,"Ali MH, Kirby DJ, Mohammed AR, Perrie Y.",https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-pdf/62/11/1646/36352669/j.2042-7158.2010.01090.x.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Targeted replacement APOE mice (APOE-TR) have been a useful tool to study the effects of APOE isoforms on brain neurochemistry and activity prior to and during AD. We use newly available APOE knock-in mice (JAX-APOE) to compare phenotypes associated with APOE4 across models. Similar to APOE4-TR mice, JAX-E4 mouse brains showed 27% lower levels of APOE protein compared with JAX-E3 (p < 0.001). We analyzed several neuroinflammatory molecules that have been associated with APOE genotype. SerpinA3 was much higher in APOE4-TR mice to APOE3-TR mice, but this effect was not seen in JAX-APOE mice. There were higher levels of IL-3 in JAX-E4 brains compared with JAX-E3, but other neuroinflammatory markers (IL6, TNFα) were not affected by APOE genotype. In terms of neuronal structure, basal dendritic spine density in the entorhinal cortex was 39% lower in JAX-E4 mice compared with JAX-E3 mice (p < 0.001), again similar to APOE-TR mice. One-week treatment with ibuprofen significantly increased dendritic spine density in the JAX-E4 mice, consistent with our previous finding in APOE-TR mice. Behaviorally, there was no effect of APOE genotype on Barnes Maze learning and memory in 6-month-old JAX-APOE mice. Overall, the experiments performed in JAX-APOE mice validated findings from APOE-TR mice, identifying particularly strong effects of APOE4 genotype on lower APOE protein levels and simplified neuron structure.

The development of mouse models of amyloid deposition permitted direct tests of the proposal that amyloid-activated microglia could cause neurodegeneration in vivo. Many approaches to manipulating microglial activation have been applied to these mouse models, and are the subject of this review. In general, these results do not support a direct neuricidal action of microglia in mouse amyloid models under any activation state. Some of the manipulations cause both a reduction in pathology and a reduction in microglial activation. However, at least for agents like ibuprofen, this outcome may result from a direct action on amyloid production, and a reduction in the microglial-provoking amyloid deposits, rather than from reduced microglial activation leading to a decline in amyloid deposition. Instead, a surprising number of the experimental manipulations which increase microglial activation lead to enhanced clearance of the amyloid deposits. Both the literature and new data presented here suggest that either classical or alternative activation of microglia can lead to enhanced amyloid clearance. However, a limited number of studies comparing the same treatments in amyloid-depositing vs. tau-depositing mice find the opposite effects. Treatments that benefit amyloid pathology accelerate tau pathology. This observation argues strongly that potential treatments be tested for impact on both amyloid and tau pathology before consideration of testing in humans.",2013,,"Lee DC, Rizer J, Hunt JB, Selenica ML, Gordon MN, Morgan D.",https://doi.org/10.1111/nan.12002,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Two types of MDH have been reported: the first one, which develops to different drugs administered simultaneously and the second type, in which sensitizations develop sequentially. In children, studies which diagnose MDH on the basis of positive allergologic tests to 2 or more chemically different drugs are lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a prospective study evaluating children with histories of MDH by skin tests, patch tests, serum-specific IgE assays, and drug provocation tests.<h4>Results</h4>A MDH was diagnosed in 7 (2.5%) of the 279 children evaluated who completed the study. The responsible drugs were β-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins) in 5 episodes, ibuprofen and anticonvulsants in 3, and erythromycin, fentanyl, methylprednisolone, and cotrimoxazole in 1. Sensitivity to 2 chemically different drugs was diagnosed in 6 children and to 3 drugs in 1 child. Two of the 7 children presented the first type of MDH, whereas 5 displayed the second one.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MDH can occur in children, even to drugs other than antibiotics. It is crucial to evaluate children with histories of MDH using both in vivo and in vitro allergologic tests, including challenges.

However, the exercise-induced release of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) may also contribute to the rise in T<sub>C</sub> by increasing the hypothalamic temperature set point. This study investigated whether the exercise-induced increase in T<sub>C</sub> is partly caused by an altered hypothalamic temperature set point.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifteen healthy, active men age 36 ± 14 y were recruited. Subjects performed submaximal treadmill exercise in 3 randomized test conditions: (1) 400 mg ibuprofen and 1000 mg acetaminophen (IBU/APAP), (2) 1000 mg acetaminophen (APAP), and (3) a control condition (CTRL). Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were used to block the effect of IL-6 at a central and peripheral level, respectively.

Serum IL-6 concentrations increased in all 3 conditions.

No differences were observed in skin temperature and heart-rate responses across conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combined administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen resulted in an attenuated increase in T<sub>C</sub> during exercise compared with a CTRL.

Sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1; SLC5A8) is expressed in kidney, thyroid gland, neurons, and intestinal tract and exhibits substrate specificity similar to that of the proton-dependent MCT (SLC16A) family. The role of SMCT1 in GHB disposition has not been determined. In this study we characterized the driving force, transport kinetics, and inhibitors of GHB uptake, as well as expression of SMCT and MCT isoforms, in rat thyroid follicular (FRTL-5) cells. GHB, as well as the monocarboxylates butyrate and d-lactate, exhibited sodium-dependent uptake at pH 7.4, which could be described with a simple Michaelis-Menten equation plus a diffusional component [K(m) 0.68 +/- 0.30 mM, V(max) 3.50 +/- 1.58 nmol . mg(-1) . min(-1), and diffusional clearance (P) 0.25 +/- 0.08 microl . mg(-1) . min(-1)]. In the absence of sodium, GHB uptake was significantly increased at lower pH, suggesting proton-gradient dependent transport. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western analyses demonstrated the expression of SMCT1, MCT1, and MCT2 in FRTL-5 cells, supporting the activity results. Sodium-dependent GHB uptake in FRTL-5 cells was inhibited by MCT substrates (d-lactate, l-lactate, pyruvate, and butyrate), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen), and probenecid. IC(50) values for l-lactate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and probenecid were 101, 31.6, 64.4, and 380 muM, respectively. All four inhibitors also significantly inhibited GHB uptake in rat MCT1 gene-transfected MDA/MB231 cells, suggesting they are not specific for SMCT1.

Acyl glucuronides have been hypothesized to be reactive metabolites and may be associated with toxicity. Both time- and concentration-dependent glucuronidation and covalent binding of BNX, FLX, and ibuprofen (IBP) were determined by exposing sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes to each NSAID. The levels of glucuronide and covalent protein adduct measured in cells followed the order BNX > FLX > IBP. These results indicate that 1) BNX-glucuronide (G) is more reactive than FLX-G, and 2) IBP-G is the least reactive metabolite, which support previous in vivo studies in rats. The proportional increases of protein adduct formation for BNX, FLX, and IBP as acyl glucuronidation increased also support the hypothesis that part of the covalent binding of all three NSAIDs to hepatic proteins is acyl glucuronide-dependent. Moreover, theses studies confirmed the feasibility of using sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes for studying glucuronidation and covalent binding to hepatocellular proteins. These studies also showed that these in vitro methods can be applied using human tissues for the study of acyl glucuronide reactivity. More BNX-protein adduct was formed in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes than FLX-protein adduct, which not only agreed with its relative toxicity in humans but also was consistent with the in vitro findings using rat hepatocyte cultures.

Although experimental rodents are used in preclinical studies to predict glucuronidation and toxicity of drugs in humans, species differences in glucuronidation and drug-induced toxicity have been reported. Humanized UGT1 mice in which the original Ugt1 locus was disrupted and replaced with the human UGT1 locus (hUGT1 mice) were recently developed. In this study, acyl-glucuronidations of etodolac, diclofenac, and ibuprofen in liver microsomes of hUGT1 mice were examined and compared with those of humans and regular mice. The kinetics of etodolac, diclofenac, and ibuprofen acyl-glucuronidation in hUGT1 mice were almost comparable to those in humans, rather than in mice. We further investigated the hepatotoxicity of ibuprofen in hUGT1 mice and regular mice by measuring serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels. Because ALT levels were increased at 6 hours after dosing in hUGT1 mice and at 24 hours after dosing in regular mice, the onset pattern of ibuprofen-induced liver toxicity in hUGT1 mice was different from that in regular mice. These data suggest that hUGT1 mice can be valuable tools for understanding glucuronidations of drugs and drug-induced toxicity in humans.",2014,,"Kutsuno Y, Itoh T, Tukey RH, Fujiwara R.",https://doi.org/10.1124/dmd.114.057083,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The in vitro to in vivo extrapolation approach used in this work was developed to predict possible drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that may occur after coadministration of pemetrexed and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and it included in vitro assays, risk assessment models, and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. The pemetrexed transport and its inhibition parameters by several NSAIDs were quantified using HEK-PEAK cells expressing organic anion transporter (OAT) 3 or OAT4. The NSAIDs were ranked according to their DDI index, calculated as the ratio of their maximum unbound concentration in plasma over the concentration inhibiting 50% (IC50) of active pemetrexed transport. A PBPK model for ibuprofen, the NSAID with the highest DDI index, was built incorporating active renal secretion in Simcyp Simulator. The bottom-up model for pemetrexed underpredicted the clearance by 2-fold. The model we built using a scaling factor of 5.3 for the maximal uptake rate (Vmax) of OAT3, which estimated using plasma concentration profiles from patients given a 10-minute infusion of 500 mg/m(2) of pemetrexed supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12, recovered the clinical data adequately. The observed/predicted increases in Cmax and the area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC0-inf) of pemetrexed when ibuprofen was coadministered were 1.1 and 1.0, respectively. The coadministration of all other NSAIDs was predicted to have no significant impact on the AUC0-inf based on their DDI indexes.

Because PARs are found in the spinal cord and increased prostaglandin release in the spinal cord causes thermal hyperalgesia, we hypothesized that activation of these spinal PARs would stimulate prostaglandin production and cause a cyclooxygenase-dependent thermal hyperalgesia. PARs were activated using either thrombin or peptide agonists derived from the four PAR subtypes, delivered to the lumbar spinal cord. Dialysis experiments were conducted in conscious, unrestrained rats using loop microdialysis probes placed in the lumbar intrathecal space. Intrathecal thrombin stimulated release of prostaglandin E (PGE)(2) but not aspartate or glutamate. Intrathecal delivery of the PAR 1-derived peptide SFLLRN-NH(2) and the PAR 2-derived peptide SLIGRL both stimulated PGE(2) release; PAR 3-derived TFRGAP and PAR 4-derived GYPGQV were inactive. Intrathecal thrombin had no effect upon formalin-induced flinching or tactile sensitivity but resulted in a thermal hyperalgesia. Intrathecal SFLLRN-NH(2) and SLIGRL both produced thermal hyperalgesia. Consistent with their effects on spinal PGE(2), hyperalgesia from these peptides was blocked by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen. SLIGRL-induced hyperalgesia was also blocked by the selective inhibitors SC 58,560 [5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole; cyclooxygenase (COX) 1] and SC 58,125 [5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole; COX 2].

Compared with controls, in SW480 colon and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, phospho-sulindac, phospho-aspirin, phospho-flurbiprofen, and phospho-ibuprofen (P-I) increased the levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and decreased GSH levels and thioredoxin reductase activity, whereas the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (CCDs), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan, oxaliplatin, chlorambucil, paclitaxel, and vincristine, did not. In both cell lines, phospho-NSAIDs induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation much more potently than CCDs. We then treated nude mice bearing SW480 xenografts with P-I or 5-FU that had an opposite effect on RONS in vitro. Compared with controls, P-I markedly suppressed xenograft growth, induced apoptosis in the xenografts (8.9 ± 2.7 versus 19.5 ± 3.0), inhibited cell proliferation (52.6 ± 5.58 versus 25.8 ± 7.71), and increased urinary F2-isoprostane levels (10.7 ± 3.3 versus 17.9 ± 2.2 ng/mg creatinine, a marker of oxidative stress); all differences were statistically significant. 5-FU's effects on tumor growth, apoptosis, proliferation, and F2-isoprostane were not statistically significant. F2-isoprostane levels correlated with the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth. P-I induced oxidative stress only in the tumors, and its apoptotic effect was restricted to xenografts.

Here, we studied the metabolism of phospho-NSAIDs by carboxylesterases and assessed the impact of carboxylesterases on the anticancer activity of phospho-NSAIDs in vitro and in vivo. The expression of human liver carboxylesterase (CES1) and intestinal carboxylesterase (CES2) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells resulted in the rapid intracellular hydrolysis of phospho-NSAIDs. Kinetic analysis revealed that CES1 is more active in the hydrolysis of phospho-sulindac, phospho-ibuprofen, phospho-naproxen, phospho-indomethacin, and phospho-tyrosol-indomethacin that possessed a bulky acyl moiety, whereas the phospho-aspirins are preferentially hydrolyzed by CES2. Carboxylesterase expression leads to a significant attenuation of the in vitro cytotoxicity of phospho-NSAIDs, suggesting that the integrity of the drug is critical for anticancer activity. Benzil and bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP), two carboxylesterase inhibitors, abrogated the effect of carboxylesterases and resensitized carboxylesterase-expressing cells to the potent cytotoxic effects of phospho-NSAIDs. In mice, coadministration of phospho-sulindac and BNPP partially protected the former from esterase-mediated hydrolysis, and this combination more effectively inhibited the growth of AGS human gastric xenografts in nude mice (57%) compared with phospho-sulindac alone (28%) (p = 0.037).

We have tested ibuprofen, as well as isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), a NO donor, to learn whether used alone or together they protect dysferlin-null muscle in A/J mice from large strain injury (LSI) induced by a series of high strain lengthening contractions. Mice were maintained on chow containing ibuprofen and ISDN for 4 weeks. They were then subjected to LSI and maintained on the drugs for 3 additional days. We measured loss of torque immediately following injury and at day 3 postinjury, fiber necrosis, and macrophage infiltration at day 3 postinjury, and serum levels of the drugs at the time of euthanasia. Loss of torque immediately after injury was not altered by the drugs. However, the torque on day 3 postinjury significantly decreased as a function of ibuprofen concentration in the serum (range, 0.67-8.2 <i>µ</i>g/ml), independent of ISDN. The effects of ISDN on torque loss at day 3 postinjury were not significant. In long-term studies of dysferlinopathic BlAJ mice, lower doses of ibuprofen had no effects on muscle morphology, but reduced treadmill running by 40%.

In this study, we report that other fenamates, including flufenamic acid, mefenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, and a phenyl acetic acid derivative, diclofenac, also are low-potency (EC(50) = 80 μM to 2.1 mM), partial agonists of human Slo2.1 channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Substituent analysis determined that N-phenylanthranilic acid was the minimal pharmacophore for fenamate activation of Slo2.1 channels. The effects of fenamates were biphasic, with an initial rapid activation phase followed by a slow phase of current inhibition. Ibuprofen, a structurally dissimilar COX inhibitor, did not activate Slo2.1. Preincubation of oocytes with ibuprofen did not significantly alter the effects of NFA, suggesting that neither channel activation nor inhibition is associated with COX activity. A point mutation (A278R) in the pore-lining S6 segment of Slo2.1 increased the sensitivity to activation and reduced the inhibition induced by NFA. Together, our results suggest that fenamates bind to two sites on Slo2.1 channels: an extracellular accessible site to activate and a cytoplasmic accessible site in the pore to inhibit currents.",2012,,"Garg P, Sanguinetti MC.",https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.112.079194,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Prostanoids are derived from arachidonic acid by the sequential actions of phospholipase A(2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and specific prostaglandin (PG) synthases. There are two major COX enzymes, COX1 and COX2, that differ in structure, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and function. COX1 is largely constitutively expressed, whereas COX2 is induced at sites of inflammation and vascular injury. PGI(2) is produced by endothelial cells and influences many cardiovascular processes. PGI(2) acts mainly on the prostacyclin (IP) receptor, but because of receptor homology, PGI(2) analogs such as iloprost may act on other prostanoid receptors with variable affinities. PGI(2)/IP interaction stimulates G protein-coupled increase in cAMP and protein kinase A, resulting in decreased [Ca(2+)](i), and could also cause inhibition of Rho kinase, leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, PGI(2) intracrine signaling may target nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and regulate gene transcription. PGI(2) counteracts the vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregation effects of thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and both prostanoids create an important balance in cardiovascular homeostasis. The PGI(2)/TXA(2) balance is particularly critical in the regulation of maternal and fetal vascular function during pregnancy and in the newborn. A decrease in PGI(2)/TXA(2) ratio in the maternal, fetal, and neonatal circulation may contribute to preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), respectively. On the other hand, increased PGI(2) activity may contribute to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and intraventricular hemorrhage in premature newborns. These observations have raised interest in the use of COX inhibitors and PGI(2) analogs in the management of pregnancy-associated and neonatal vascular disorders. The use of aspirin to decrease TXA(2) synthesis has shown little benefit in preeclampsia, whereas indomethacin and ibuprofen are used effectively to close PDA in the premature newborn. PGI(2) analogs have been used effectively in primary pulmonary hypertension in adults and have shown promise in PPHN. Careful examination of PGI(2) metabolism and the complex interplay with other prostanoids will help design specific modulators of the PGI(2)-dependent pathways for the management of pregnancy-related and neonatal vascular disorders.",2012,,"Majed BH, Khalil RA.",https://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/pharmrev/64/3/540.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We have previously demonstrated that diets enriched in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) effectively reduce pathological retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, in part through metabolic products that suppress microglial-derived tumor necrosis factor-α. To better understand the protective effects of ω-3 PUFAs, we examined the relative importance of major lipid metabolic pathways and their products in contributing to this effect. ω-3 PUFA diets were fed to four lines of mice deficient in each key lipid-processing enzyme (cyclooxygenase 1 or 2, or lipoxygenase 5 or 12/15), retinopathy was induced by oxygen exposure; only loss of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) abrogated the protection against retinopathy of dietary ω-3 PUFAs. This protective effect was due to 5-LOX oxidation of the ω-3 PUFA lipid docosahexaenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid (4-HDHA). 4-HDHA directly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), independent of 4-HDHA's anti-inflammatory effects. Our study suggests that ω-3 PUFAs may be profitably used as an alternative or supplement to current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for proliferative retinopathy and points to the therapeutic potential of ω-3 PUFAs and metabolites in other diseases of vasoproliferation.

This severe and life-threatening disorder often results in the development of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), which can occur either before or after surgical resection of the affected bowel segment. Using colonic tissue from patients with HSCR alongside the well-established endothelin receptor B knockout mouse model, we investigated epithelial regeneration dynamics and stromal-epithelial cross-talk in the distal ganglionic colon, a critical site for HAEC development. In individuals with HSCR but without epithelial damage, the distal ganglionic colon displayed impaired epithelial regeneration and alteration of intestinal stem cell dynamics, characterized by the reduction of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5<sup>+</sup>) epithelial stem cells. This phenomenon was consistent in the mouse model, where impaired regenerative ability preceded HAEC when epithelial damage occurred on site. Patients with HSCR also exhibited remodeling in stromal cells in this distal ganglionic colon region, with fewer primary sources of Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signal-releasing stromal cells and the exclusive presence of proinflammatory (matrix metalloproteinase 1<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells. Stromal cells from the HSCR distal ganglionic colon failed to sustain the growth of colonic organoids.

Determination of ibuprofen's <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Burkholderia</i> species strains through measurements of the endpoint number of CFU and growth kinetics showed that ibuprofen reduced the growth rate and bacterial burden of the tested strains in a dose-dependent fashion. In an <i>in vitro</i><i>Pseudomonas</i> biofilm model, a reduction in the rate of biomass accumulation over 8 h of growth with ibuprofen treatment was observed. Next, an acute <i>Pseudomonas</i> pneumonia model was used to test this antimicrobial activity after the oral delivery of ibuprofen. Following intranasal inoculation, ibuprofen-treated mice exhibited lower CFU counts and improved survival compared with the control animals. Preliminary biodistribution studies performed after the delivery of ibuprofen to mice by aerosol demonstrated a rapid accumulation of ibuprofen in serum and minimum retention in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Therefore, ibuprofen-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles (Ibu-NPs) were formulated to improve the pharmacokinetic profile.

Renal secretion and glomerular filtration are the major pathways for the elimination of PAS. We comprehensively studied PAS transport by using cell lines that overexpressed various transporters and found that PAS acts as a novel substrate of an organic anionic polypeptide (OATP1B1), organic cationic transporters (OCT1 and OCT2), and organic anion transporters (OAT1 and OAT3) but is not a substrate of any ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Net PAS uptake was measured, and the transport affinities (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values) for OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 were found to be 50.0, 20.3, 28.7, 78.1, and 100.1 μM, respectively. The net uptake rates suggested that renal OAT1 and OAT3 play relatively major roles in PAS elimination. The representative inhibitors rifampin for OATP1B1, probenecid for OAT1 and OAT3, and verapamil for OCT1 and OCT2 greatly inhibited PAS uptake, suggesting that PAS is dependent on multiple transporters for uptake. We also evaluated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and metformin for the inhibition of PAS uptake via these transporters. Half-maximal (50%) inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>s) were kinetically determined and used to predict the drug-drug interactions (DDIs) affecting these transporters' activity toward PAS. We found that rifampin, probenecid, ibuprofen, naproxen, cimetidine, and quinidine each exhibited a significant potential for <i>in vivo</i> DDIs with PAS.

Thus, there is a constant need to find new drugs to better manage fungal infections. Toward this end, the study described in this paper considered the repurposing of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and ibuprofen as alternative drugs to control the growth of cryptococcal cells. In vitro susceptibility tests, including a checkerboard assay, were performed to assess the response of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii to the above-mentioned anti-inflammatory drugs. Next, the capacity of these two drugs to induce stress as well as their mode of action in the killing of cryptococcal cells was determined. The studied fungal strains revealed a response to both aspirin and ibuprofen that was dose dependent, with ibuprofen exerting greater antimicrobial action. More importantly, the MICs of these drugs did not negatively (i) affect growth or (ii) impair the functioning of macrophages; rather, they enhanced the ability of these immune cells to phagocytose cryptococcal cells. Ibuprofen was also shown to act in synergy with fluconazole and amphotericin B. The treatment of cryptococcal cells with aspirin or ibuprofen led to stress induction via activation of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, and cell death was eventually achieved through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated membrane damage. The presented data highlight the potential clinical application of aspirin and ibuprofen as candidate anti-Cryptococcus drugs.",2016,,"Ogundeji AO, Pohl CH, Sebolai OM.",https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.02810-15,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It comprises the activity of styrene monooxygenase, styrene oxide isomerase, and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase, yielding phenylacetic acid as the central metabolite. The alternative route comprises ring-hydroxylating enzymes and yields vinyl catechol as central metabolite, which undergoes <i>meta</i>-cleavage. This was reported to be unspecific and also allows the degradation of benzene derivatives. However, some bacteria had been described to degrade styrene but do not employ one of those routes or only parts of them. Here, we describe a novel ""hybrid"" degradation pathway for styrene located on a plasmid of foreign origin. As putatively also unspecific, it allows metabolizing chemically analogous compounds (e.g., halogenated and/or alkylated styrene derivatives). <i>Gordonia rubripertincta</i> CWB2 was isolated with styrene as the sole source of carbon and energy. It employs an assembled route of the styrene side-chain degradation and isoprene degradation pathways that also funnels into phenylacetic acid as the central metabolite. Metabolites, enzyme activity, genome, transcriptome, and proteome data reinforce this observation and allow us to understand this biotechnologically relevant pathway, which can be used for the production of ibuprofen.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The degradation of xenobiotics by bacteria is not only important for bioremediation but also because the involved enzymes are potential catalysts in biotechnological applications. This study reveals a novel degradation pathway for the hazardous organic compound styrene in <i>Gordonia rubripertincta</i> CWB2.

Wastewater contaminants include a variety of personal care products, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupters, bacteria, and viruses. Groundwater from 22 wells completed in a semi-confined to confined, fractured Silurian dolostone aquifer in southern Wellington County, Ontario, Canada, was analyzed for 14 organic wastewater contaminants (4 artificial sweeteners, 10 pharmaceuticals) as well as <i>E. coli</i>, total coliforms, and 6 human enteric viruses. Enteric viruses were detected in 8.6% of 116 samples, and at least one organic wastewater contaminant was detected in 82% of the wells (in order of decreasing detection frequency: acesulfame, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, carbamazepine, and saccharin). Virus indicator metrics [positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), sensitivity, specificity] were calculated at the sample and well level for the organic wastewater compounds, <i>E. coli</i>, and total coliforms. Fecal bacteria were not good predictors of virus presence (PPV = 0%-8%). Of the potential chemical indicators, triclosan performed the best at the sample level (PPV = 50%, NPV = 100%), and ibuprofen performed the best at the well level (PPV = 60%, NPV = 67%); however, no samples had triclosan or ibuprofen concentrations above their practical quantification limits. Therefore, none of the compounds performed sufficiently well to be considered reliable for assessing the potential threat of enteric viruses in wastewater-impacted groundwater in this bedrock aquifer. Future studies need to evaluate the indicator potential of persistent organic wastewater contaminants in different types of aquifers, especially in fractured rock where heterogeneity is strong.IMPORTANCEAssessing the potential risk that human enteric viruses pose in groundwater aquifers used for potable water supply is complicated by several factors, including: (i) labor-intensive methods for the isolation and quantification of viruses in groundwater, (ii) the temporal variability of these viruses in domestic wastewater, and (iii) their potentially rapid transport in the subsurface, especially in fractured rock aquifers. Therefore, aquifer risk assessment would benefit from the identification of suitable proxy indicators of enteric viruses that are easier to analyze and less variable in wastewater sources. Traditional fecal indicators (e.g., <i>E. coli</i> and coliforms) are generally poor indicators of enteric viruses in groundwater. While many studies have examined the use of pharmaceutical and personal care products as tracers of domestic wastewater and fecal pollution in the environment, there is a paucity of data on the potential use of these chemical tracers as enteric virus indicators, especially in groundwater.",2024,,"Race AS, Spoelstra J, Parker BL.",https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01213-23,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, little research exists on the effect of initial PPCP concentration on PPCP biotransformation or on the microbial communities treating impacted water. In this study, biological PPCP removal at various concentrations was assessed using laboratory columns inoculated with wastewater treatment plant effluent. Pyrosequencing was used to examine microbial communities in the columns and in soil from a soil aquifer treatment (SAT; a method of water treatment prior to reuse) site. Laboratory columns were supplied with different concentrations (0.25, 10, 100, or 1,000 μg liter(-1)) of each of 15 PPCPs. Five PPCPs (4-isopropyl-3-methylphenol [biosol], p-chloro-m-xylenol, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen, and phenytoin) were not removed at any tested concentrations. Two PPCPs (naproxen and triclosan) exhibited removals independent of PPCP concentration. PPCP removal efficiencies were dependent on initial concentrations for biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, chlorophene, diclofenac, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, and valproic acid, showing that PPCP concentration can affect biotransformation. Biofilms from sand samples collected from the 0.25- and 10-μg liter(-1) PPCP columns were pyrosequenced along with SAT soil samples collected on three consecutive days of a wetting and drying cycle to enable comparison of these two communities exposed to PPCPs. SAT communities were similar to column communities in taxonomy and phylotype composition, and both were found to contain close relatives of known PPCP degraders. The efficiency of biological removal of PPCPs was found to be dependent on the concentration at which the contamination occurs for some, but not all, PPCPs.",2014,,"Onesios-Barry KM, Berry D, Proescher JB, Sivakumar IK, Bouwer EJ.",https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03693-13,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

LPS levels rose as early as 1 h after CLP and increased further after 2 and 21 h. TNF-alpha was detectable in serum, spleen, liver, and lungs during the first 4 h, with a peak 2 h after CLP. IL-1 beta was measurable in serum after 24 h, and levels increased significantly in spleen and liver 4 and 8 h after CLP. IL-6 levels increased significantly in serum throughout the first 16 h after CLP. These cytokines were detectable after LPS injection, with kinetics similar to those after CLP but at a significantly higher level. To cast more light on the differences between these two animal models of septic shock, we studied the effects of different reference drugs. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (DEX); ibuprofen (IBU), an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase; and NG-nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, significantly reduced survival, while chlorpromazine (CPZ) and TNF did not affect it. Only the antibiotics and pentoxifylline significantly increased survival in mice with CLP. However, CPZ and DEX protected the mice from LPS mortality. On inhibiting TNF-alpha with DEX, CPZ, or pentoxifylline, survival was reduced, unchanged, and increased, respectively, and on increasing TNF-alpha with IBU and TNF, survival was decreased or unchanged, respectively, suggesting that the modulation of this cytokine does not play a significant role in sepsis induced by CLP, unlike treatment with LPS.

In the anterior hypothalamus and in skeletal muscles leukocytic pyrogen appears to induce the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 which mediates fever and skeletal protein catabolism. It is unclear whether any additional metabolic responses to leukocytic pyrogen result from prostaglandin production. This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of ibuprofen, a specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, to alter protein and trace metal responses to leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin when given in quantities sufficient to block the febrile response. In guinea pigs given continuous infusions of leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin, a 0.6 to 0.8 degrees C fever was observed within 4 h, and zinc and iron concentrations in serum fell by 63 to 78% (P less than 0.01). Rates of whole body amino acid appearance, oxidation, and incorporation into protein were all significantly increased by leukocytic pyrogen and endotoxin treatment, (P less than 0.05) as were the fractional hepatic and seromucoid protein synthesis rates in leukocytic pyrogen-treated animals (P less than 0.01). Muscle protein synthesis was unchanged. Although pretreatment with infusions of ibuprofen completely ablated the febrile response to leukocytic pyrogen and endotoxin, decreases in zinc and iron concentrations in serum and leukocytosis were unaffected. Overall increases in whole body amino acid kinetics induced by leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin were only minimally affected by ibuprofen. We concluded that treatment with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor ibuprofen did not affect whole body trace metal, hematological, or hepatic acute-phase-induced responses to leukocytic pyrogen or endotoxin, either because these responses are prostanoid independent or because they are only partially mediated by eicosanoid products.",1983,,"Sobrado J, Moldawer LL, Bistrian BR, Dinarello CA, Blackburn GL.",http://iai.asm.org/cgi/reprint/42/3/997,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

As for diverse gram-negative bacteria, this pathogenic bacterium accumulates diffusible N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules, and when a threshold concentration is reached, virulence factor genes are activated. Human submucosal tracheal gland serous (HTGS) cells are believed to play a major role in the physiopathology of CF. Since ATP and UTP stimulate CF epithelial cells through P2Y receptors, we sought to determine whether CF HTGS cells are capable of responding to the AHLs N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL), N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (HHL), N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), and N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL), with special reference to P2Y receptors. All AHLs inhibited ATP- and UTP-induced secretion by CF HTGS cells. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were as high as 10 and 5 microM for BHL and HHL, respectively, but were only 0.3 and 0.4 pM for OdDHL and OHHL, respectively. Furthermore, all AHLs down-regulated the expression of the P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors. Ibuprofen and nordihydroguaiaretic acid were able to prevent AHL inhibition of the responses to nucleotides, but neither dexamethasone nor indomethacin was able to do this. These data indicate that AHLs may alter responsiveness to ATP and UTP by CF HTGS cells and suggest that, in addition to ATP and/or UTP analogues, ibuprofen may be of use for a combinational pharmacological therapy for CF.",1999,,"Saleh A, Figarella C, Kammouni W, Marchand-Pinatel S, Lazdunski A, Tubul A, Brun P, Merten MD.",http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/full/67/10/5076,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is associated with severe consequences, including the abnormal development of the neural system in fetuses and neurological diseases in adults. Therefore, the development of anti-ZIKV drugs is of paramount importance. Screening of generic drugs revealed that several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, and lornoxicam, potently inhibited the entry of Zika virus Env/HIV-1-pseudotyped viruses. They also significantly inhibited the replication of wild-type ZIKV both in cell lines and in primary human fetal endothelial cells. Interestingly, the NSAIDs exerted this inhibitory effect by potently reducing the expression of AXL, the entry cofactor of ZIKV. Further studies showed that the NSAIDs downregulated the prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>/prostaglandin E receptor 2 (EP2)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway and reduced PKA-dependent CDC37 phosphorylation and the interaction between CDC37 and HSP90, which subsequently facilitated CHIP/ubiquitination/proteasome-mediated AXL degradation. Taken together, our results highlight a new mechanism of action of antiviral agents which may assist in designing a convenient strategy for treating ZIKV-infected patients.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, which causes congenital malformations, including microcephaly and other neurological disorders, has attracted global attention. We observed that several NSAIDs significantly inhibited ZIKV infection. Based on our observations, we propose a novel mechanism of action of antiviral compounds which involves the blockade of virus entry via degradation of the entry cofactor.

Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals.IMPORTANCEElderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.",2025,,"Miller JL, Leedale C, Kang D, Lilue J, Harder OE, Niewiesk S.",https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01863-24,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

After an initial screening visit, patients were withdrawn from their pre-study NSAID and, following a flare of their OA symptoms, were randomised to ibuprofen (2400 mg/day) or placebo. Urinary CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD levels were measured at time of randomisation (baseline) and after 4-6 weeks of treatment.<h4>Results</h4>After 4 to 6 weeks, urinary CTX-II (+17%, p = 0.023) and Glc-Gal-PYD (+10%, p = 0.020) increased significantly from baseline in the placebo group whereas marginal or no increase was observed in the ibuprofen group (CTX-II +2%, NS and Glc-Gal-PYD +4%, p = 0.045). For urinary CTX-II, the difference in the change from baseline between placebo and ibuprofen treated groups was significant (13%, p = 0.017). At baseline, urinary levels of CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD were higher in patients with knee swelling (n = 127) than in those without (n = 74) (p<0.02 for both markers). When patients were stratified according to presence or absence of knee swelling at baseline, the increases over 4-6 weeks of urinary CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD in the placebo group were restricted to patients with knee swelling (+22% from baseline, p = 0.001 and +12%, p = 0.011, for urinary CTX-II and Glc-Gal-PYD respectively). In patients with knee swelling who were treated with ibuprofen this increase was not observed and the difference from placebo was significant for urinary CTX-II (p = 0.014).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In patients with a flare of knee OA, specifically in patients with evidence of joint inflammation documented by knee swelling, there was a significant increase in markers reflecting cartilage and synovium metabolism that could partly be prevented by high doses of ibuprofen.

Manufacturers of celecoxib and lumiracoxib provided additional data.<h4>Study selection</h4>All large scale randomised controlled trials comparing any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or placebo. Two investigators independently assessed eligibility.<h4>Data extraction</h4>The primary outcome was myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes included stroke, death from cardiovascular disease, and death from any cause. Two investigators independently extracted data.<h4>Data synthesis</h4>31 trials in 116 429 patients with more than 115 000 patient years of follow-up were included. Patients were allocated to naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib, etoricoxib, rofecoxib, lumiracoxib, or placebo. Compared with placebo, rofecoxib was associated with the highest risk of myocardial infarction (rate ratio 2.12, 95% credibility interval 1.26 to 3.56), followed by lumiracoxib (2.00, 0.71 to 6.21). Ibuprofen was associated with the highest risk of stroke (3.36, 1.00 to 11.6), followed by diclofenac (2.86, 1.09 to 8.36). Etoricoxib (4.07, 1.23 to 15.7) and diclofenac (3.98, 1.48 to 12.7) were associated with the highest risk of cardiovascular death.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although uncertainty remains, little evidence exists to suggest that any of the investigated drugs are safe in cardiovascular terms. Naproxen seemed least harmful.

In both groups additional antibiotic treatment was subsequently prescribed as necessary for persistent, worsening, or recurrent symptoms. The primary endpoints were the number of all courses of antibiotic treatment on days 0-28 (for UTI or other conditions) and burden of symptoms on days 0-7. The symptom score included dysuria, frequency/urgency, and low abdominal pain.<h4>Study answer and limitations</h4>The 248 women in the ibuprofen group received significantly fewer course of antibiotics, had a significantly higher total burden of symptoms, and more had pyelonephritis. Four serious adverse events occurred that lead to hospital referrals; one of these was potentially related to the trial drug. Results have to be interpreted carefully as they might apply to women with mild to moderate symptoms rather than to all those with an uncomplicated UTI.<h4>What this paper adds</h4>Two thirds of women with uncomplicated UTI treated symptomatically with ibuprofen recovered without any antibiotics. Initial symptomatic treatment is a possible approach to be discussed with women willing to avoid immediate antibiotics and to accept a somewhat higher burden of symptoms.<h4>Funding, competing interests, data sharing</h4>German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) No 01KG1105.

New in vitro evidence suggests that this increased CV risk may be mediated through aldosterone glucuronidation inhibition (AGI), which differs between NSAIDs (diclofenac>naproxen>indomethacin>ibuprofen). Our aim was to explore the association between ns-NSAID-related AGI and arterial dysfunction.<h4>Methods</h4>The extent (augmentation index, AIX%) and timing (reflected wave transit time, RWT, ms) of aortic wave reflection (measured using radial applanation pulse wave analysis, PWA, SphygmoCor device) were assessed on a single occasion in 114 consecutive RA patients without overt CV disease aged 40-65 years. A higher AIX% and lower RWT indicate arterial dysfunction. Assessment included a fasting blood sample, patient questionnaire and medical record review. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for age, sex, mean blood pressure, smoking, cumulative erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR-years) and Stanford disability score.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 60 patients taking ns-NSAIDs and 25 non-users. Using a ns-NSAID with the highest AGI was associated with a higher AIX% (and lower RWT) versus treatment with a ns-NSAID with the lowest AGI (diclofenac AIX% 32.3, RWT 132.7 ms vs ibuprofen AIX% 23.8, RWT 150.9 ms): adjusted mean differences AIX% 6.5 (95% CI 1.0 to 11.9; p=0.02); RWT -14.2 ms (95% CI -22.2 to -6.3; p=0.001). Indomethacin demonstrated an intermediate level of arterial dysfunction. In relation to arterial dysfunction, both indomethacin and naproxen were more similar to diclofenac than to ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ns-NSAID-related AGI is associated with arterial dysfunction in patients with RA. These findings provide a potentially novel insight into the CV toxicity of commonly used ns-NSAIDs. However, the findings are limited by the small number of patients involved and require further replication in a much larger study.",2011,,"Crilly MA, Mangoni AA.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000076,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The aim of this study was to validate the use of the high-throughput spot culture growth inhibition (HT-SPOTi) assay for screening libraries of compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to study the inhibitory effect of ibuprofen (IBP) and the other 2-arylpropanoic acids on the growth inhibition of M tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species.<h4>Methods</h4>The HT-SPOTi method was validated not only with known drugs but also with a library of 47 confirmed anti-TB active compounds published in the ChEMBL database. Three over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also included in the screening. The 2-arylpropanoic acids, including IBP, were comprehensively evaluated against phenotypically and physiologically different strains of mycobacteria, and their cytotoxicity was determined against murine RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, a comparative bioinformatic analysis was employed to propose a potential mycobacterial target.<h4>Results</h4>IBP showed antitubercular properties while carprofen was the most potent among the 2-arylpropanoic class. A 3,5-dinitro-IBP derivative was found to be more potent than IBP but equally selective. Other synthetic derivatives of IBP were less active, and the free carboxylic acid of IBP seems to be essential for its anti-TB activity. IBP, carprofen and the 3,5-dinitro-IBP derivative exhibited activity against multidrug-resistant isolates and stationary phase bacilli. On the basis of the human targets of the 2-arylpropanoic analgesics, the protein initiation factor infB (Rv2839c) of M tuberculosis was proposed as a potential molecular target.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The HT-SPOTi method can be employed reliably and reproducibly to screen the antimicrobial potency of different compounds. IBP demonstrated specific antitubercular activity, while carprofen was the most selective agent among the 2-arylpropanoic class. Activity against stationary phase bacilli and multidrug-resistant isolates permits us to speculate a novel mechanism of antimycobacterial action.

Inhibition of the Rho pathway in a central nervous system-effective manner requires higher dosages compared with orthodox cyclooxygenase-blocking effects. Preclinical studies on spinal cord injury (SCI) imply improved motor recovery after ibuprofen/indometacin-mediated Rho inhibition. This has been reassessed by a meta-analysis of the underlying experimental evidence, which indicates an overall effect size of 20.2% regarding motor outcome achieved after ibuprofen/indometacin treatment compared with vehicle controls. In addition, ibuprofen/indometacin may also limit sickness behaviour, non-neurogenic systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), neuropathic pain and heterotopic ossifications after SCI. Consequently, 'small molecule'-mediated Rho inhibition after acute SCI warrants clinical investigation.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Protocol of an investigator-initiated clinical open-label pilot trial on high-dose ibuprofen treatment after acute traumatic, motor-complete SCI. A sample of n=12 patients will be enrolled in two cohorts treated with 2400 mg/day ibuprofen for 4 or 12 weeks, respectively. The primary safety end point is an occurrence of serious adverse events, primarily gastroduodenal bleedings. Secondary end points are pharmacokinetics, feasibility and preliminary effects on neurological recovery, neuropathic pain and heterotopic ossifications. The primary safety analysis is based on the incidence of severe gastrointestinal bleedings. Additional analyses will be mainly descriptive and casuistic.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The clinical trial protocol was approved by the responsible German state Ethics Board, and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, the principles of Good Clinical Practice and all further applicable regulations. This safety and pharmacokinetics trial informs the planning of a subsequent randomised controlled trial.

Drugs used for nervous system disorders were associated with poorer cognitive performance (antiepileptics, eg, topiramate b<sub>reasoning(score)</sub> -0.65 (95% CI -1.05 to -0.24), b<sub>memory(score)</sub> -1.41 (-1.79 to -1.04); antipsychotics, eg, risperidone b<sub>reaction time(ms)</sub> -33 (-46 to -20), negative values indicate poor cognitive performance and vice versa). Drugs used for non-nervous system conditions also showed significant negative association with cognitive score, including those where such an association might have been predicted (antihypertensives, eg, amlodipine b<sub>reasoning</sub> -0.1 (-0.15 to -0.06), b<sub>memory</sub> -0.08 (-0.13 to -0.03), b<sub>reaction time</sub> -3 (-5 to -2); antidiabetics, eg, insulin b<sub>reaction time</sub> -13 (-17 to -10)) and others where such an association was a surprising observation (proton pump inhibitors, eg, omeprazole b<sub>reasoning</sub> -0.11 (-0.15 to -0.06), b<sub>memory</sub> -0.08 (-0.12 to -0.04), b<sub>reaction time</sub> -5 (-6 to -3); laxatives, eg, contact laxatives b<sub>reaction time</sub> -13 (-19 to -8)).

We aim to investigate benefit and harm of different combinations of paracetamol, ibuprofen and dexamethasone following total hip arthroplasty.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>RECIPE is a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel 4-group, blinded trial with 90-day and 1-year follow-up performed at nine Danish hospitals. Interventions are initiated preoperatively and continued for 24 hours postoperatively. Eligible participants undergoing total hip arthroplasty are randomised to:group A: oral paracetamol 1000 mg × 4+oral ibuprofen 400 mg × 4+intravenous placebo; group B: oral paracetamol 1000 mg × 4+intravenous dexamethasone 24 mg+oral placebo; group C: oral ibuprofen 400 mg × 4+intravenous dexamethasone 24 mg+oral placebo; group D: oral paracetamol 1000 mg × 4+oral ibuprofen 400 mg × 4+intravenous dexamethasone 24 mg.Primary outcome is cumulative opioid consumption at 0-24 hours. Secondary outcomes are pain at rest, during mobilisation and during a 5 m walk and adverse events. Follow-up includes serious adverse events and patient reported outcome measures at 90 days and 1 year.

As ibuprofen selectively inhibited fatty acid oxidation in the liver or caused mitochondrial damage in intestinal cells, its effect on substrate oxidation by isolated colonocytes of man and rat was examined. Ibuprofen dose dependently (2.0-7.5 mmol/l) and selectively inhibited 14CO2 production from labelled n-butyrate in colonocytes from the proximal and distal human colon (n = 12, p = < 0.001). Glucose oxidation was either unaltered or increased. Because short chain fatty acid oxidation is the main source of acetyl-CoA for long chain fatty acid synthesis, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen in the colonic mucosa could also occur at this level. Because the concentrations of ibuprofen that can be attained in the human colon are not known, conclusions drawn from current dosages are tentative. The inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by ibuprofen may be biochemically implicated in the initiation and exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, manifestation of which would depend on the ibuprofen concentrations reached in the colon.",1995,,"Roediger WE, Millard S.",https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.36.1.55,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pharmacological concentrations of aspirin and ibuprofen (10(-8)-10(-4) M), potentiated histamine (10(-6)-10(-4)M) and forskolin (10(-5)M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion without affecting basal secretion, acetylcholine (10(-6)M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion or cell vitality. Augmentation of secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion was dependent on extracellular calcium because potentiation was abolished by calcium depletion of the medium. Cimetidine inhibited the potentiation effect on histamine but not on forskolin stimulated pepsinogen secretion, thus suggesting that this augmentation was independent of histamine H2 receptors. Of interest, potentiation was also independent of endogenous prostaglandin inhibition because exogenous addition of prostaglandin E2 and D2 increased both basal and acetylcholine stimulated pepsinogen secretion in a dose dependent way, but they did not modify histamine or histamine plus aspirin or ibuprofen stimulated pepsinogen secretion. In conclusion, aspirin and ibuprofen potentiate secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion by dispersed human peptic cells and this might be an additional mechanism of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric injury. This potentiation effect is regulated by calcium, independent of endogenous prostaglandin inhibition and seems to act on pepsinogen secretion at a post-receptor site.",1995,,"Lanas AI, Nerín J, Esteva F, Sáinz R.",https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/36/5/657.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The effect of octreotide on neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium was also evaluated.<h4>Methods</h4>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated either with saline (0.3 ml subcutaneously) or octreotide (0.001-1 ng/kg subcutaneously). After 30 minutes gastric ulcers were induced by the intragastric application of NSAIDs (20 mg/kg indomethacin, 200 mg/kg aspirin, 200 mg/kg ibuprofen, or 50 mg/kg diclofenac). Four hours later the rats were killed and gastric mucosal lesions were assessed by computed planimetry. To determine whether octreotide could prevent indomethacin induced injury in humans, 20 healthy volunteers were evaluated in a double blind, placebo controlled study.<h4>Results</h4>Octreotide prevented NSAID induced gastric mucosal lesions (p < 0.05). The dose response curve was U shaped and the most effective dose was 0.1 ng/kg. Leucocyte adherence in submucosal venules of the stomach was evaluated by in vivo microscopy. Octreotide (0.1 ng/kg subcutaneously) prevented indomethacin (20 mg/kg intragastric) induced leucocyte adherence in gastric submucosal venules (p < 0.05). Healthy human volunteers received 50 mg indomethacin orally thrice a day concomitantly with either an identical placebo or 0.01 microgram, 0.1 microgram, or 1 microgram octreotide subcutaneously thrice a day for three days. Injury was assessed by endoscopy. There was a negative correlation between the octreotide dose and injury score (p < 0.03 for gastric injury, p < 0.001 for duodenal injury).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Octreotide protects the stomach from NSAID induced gastric injury, probably via its ability to reduce NSAID induced neutrophilic adhesion to the microvasculature.

Certain HIV-exposed seronegative populations, who are naturally resistant to HIV infection, have an immune quiescent phenotype defined by reduced immune activation and inflammatory cytokines at the genital tract. Therefore, the aim of this study was to create an immune quiescent environment using immunomodulatory drugs to mitigate HIV infection. Using an <i>in vitro</i> peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) model, we found that inflammation was induced using phytohemagglutinin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR4) and R848 (TLR7/8). After treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen (IBF) and betamethasone (BMS), PBMCs were exposed to HIV NL4-3 AD8. Multiplexed ELISA was used to measure 28 cytokines to assess inflammation. Flow cytometry was used to measure immune activation (CD38, HLA-DR and CCR5) and HIV infection (p24 production) of CD4+ T cells. BMS potently suppressed inflammation (soluble cytokines, p<0.05) and immune activation (CD4+ T cells, p<0.05). BMS significantly reduced HIV infection of CD4+ T cells only in the LPS (0.98%) and unstimulated (1.7%) conditions (p<0.02). In contrast, IBF had minimal anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive but no anti-HIV effects. BMS demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects, regardless of stimulation condition. Despite uniform immunosuppression, BMS differentially affected HIV infection according to the stimulation conditions, highlighting the complex nature of these interactions. Together, these data underscore the importance of interrogating inflammatory signaling pathways to identify novel drug targets to mitigate HIV infection.",2021,,"Cromarty R, Sigal A, Liebenberg LJ, Mckinnon LR, Abdool Karim SS, Passmore JS, Archary D.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-001424,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We studied the effects of ibuprofen on gene expression in chondrocytes from patients with OA using RNA-Seq. Chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage samples of patients with OA undergoing knee replacement surgery, cultured with ibuprofen, and total mRNA was sequenced. Differentially expressed genes were identified with edgeR using pairwise comparisons. Functional analysis was performed using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Ibuprofen did not induce statistically significant changes in chondrocyte transcriptome when the cells were cultured in the absence of added cytokines. In inflammatory conditions (when the cells were exposed to the OA-related cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β), 51 genes were upregulated and 42 downregulated by ibuprofen with fold change >1.5 in either direction. The upregulated genes included anti-inflammatory factors and genes associated with cell adhesion, while several mediators of inflammation were among the downregulated genes. IPA analysis revealed ibuprofen having modulating effects on inflammation-related pathways such as integrin, IL-8, ERK/MAPK and cAMP-mediated signalling pathways.

Ischemic conditions caused partial depolarization and decrease of excitability. Neither inhibition of PG synthesis (ibuprofen, 30 micrograms/mL) nor addition of exogenous PGF2 alpha (1 ng/mL) modified responses to ""ischemia."" Reperfusion with normal Tyrode's solution stimulated PG production (measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and induced a series of electrophysiological events. Under control conditions, Purkinje fibres rapidly repolarized. Subsequently, these tissues began to depolarize and oscillatory afterpotentials appeared. Purkinje tissues depolarized further and became temporarily inexcitable. Return of activity was associated with depolarization-induced automaticity. Ibuprofen prevented reperfusion-stimulated PG release. Ibuprofen also increased the magnitude of early repolarization and greatly attenuated subsequent depolarization.

Xenopus laevis kidney A6 cells were used to investigate the effects of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity on Na+ transport. Application of aristolochic acid, a cPLA2 inhibitor, to the apical membrane of monolayers produced a decrease in apical [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) release and led to an approximate twofold increase in transepithelial Na+ current. Increased current was abolished by the nonmetabolized AA analog 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), suggesting that AA, rather than one of its metabolic products, affected current. In single channel studies, ETYA produced a decrease in ENaC open probability. This suggests that cPLA2 is tonically active in A6 cells and that the end effect of liberated AA at the apical membrane is to reduce Na+ transport via actions on ENaC. In contrast, aristolochic acid applied basolaterally inhibited current, and the effect was not reversed by ETYA. Basolateral application of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen also inhibited current. Both effects were reversed by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This suggests that cPLA2 activity and free AA, which is metabolized to PGE2, are necessary to support transport. This study supports the fine-tuning of Na+ transport and reabsorption through the regulation of free AA and AA metabolism.",2001,,"Worrell RT, Bao HF, Denson DD, Eaton DC.",http://intl-ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/281/1/C147,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Acetate, the most abundant SCFA in the foregut lumen, is absorbed immediately after ingestion, although the mechanism by which this absorption occurs is not fully understood. We investigated the distribution and function of candidate SCFA transporters in rat duodenum. The Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter-1 (SMCT1) was localized to the brush border, whereas the pH-dependent monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and MCT4 were localized to the duodenocyte basolateral membrane. In Ussing chambered duodenal mucosa, luminal acetate dose-dependently increased short-circuit current (Isc) in the presence of serosal bumetanide and indomethacin by a luminal Na(+)-dependent, ouabain-sensitive mechanism. The Isc response was inhibited dose-dependently by the SMCT1 nonsubstrate inhibitor ibuprofen, consistent with net electrogenic absorption of acetate via SMCT1. Other SCFAs and lactate also increased Isc. Furthermore, duodenal loop perfusion of acetate increased portal venous acetate concentration, inhibited by coperfusion of ibuprofen or a MCT inhibitor. Luminal acetate perfusion increased duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion via capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerve activation and cyclooxygenase activity, consistent with absorption-mediated HCO3 (-) secretion. These results suggest that absorption of luminal SCFA via SMCT1 and MCTs increases duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion. In addition to SCFA sensing via free fatty acid receptors, the presence of rapid duodenal SCFA absorption may be important for the suppression of luminal bacterial colonization and implicated in the generation of functional dyspepsia due to bacterial overgrowth.",2015,,"Kaji I, Iwanaga T, Watanabe M, Guth PH, Engel E, Kaunitz JD, Akiba Y.",https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.00298.2014,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite its efficacy, few patients receive ibuprofen treatment due to potential renal and gastrointestinal toxicity. The mechanism of ibuprofen efficacy is also unclear. We have previously demonstrated that CF microtubules are slower to reform after depolymerization compared with respective wild-type controls. Slower microtubule dynamics in CF cells are responsible for impaired intracellular transport and are related to inflammatory signaling. Here, it is identified that high-dose ibuprofen treatment in both CF cell models and primary CF nasal epithelial cells restores microtubule reformation rates to wild-type levels, as well as induce extension of microtubules to the cell periphery. Ibuprofen treatment also restores microtubule-dependent intracellular transport monitored by measuring intracellular cholesterol transport. These effects are specific to ibuprofen as other cyclooxygenase inhibitors have no effect on these measures. Effects of ibuprofen are mimicked by stimulation of AMPK and blocked by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. We conclude that high-dose ibuprofen treatment enhances microtubule formation in CF cells likely through an AMPK-related pathway.

It is well established that chronic inflammatory pain induces the expression of acid-sensitive ion channels (ASIC) in primary sensory neurons, where they contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia. The present study examines the effect of CH on ASIC expression in petrosal ganglion (PG), which contains chemoafferent neurons that innervate oxygen-sensitive type I cells in the carotid body. Five isoforms of ASIC transcript were increased ∼1.5-2.5-fold in PG following exposure of rats to 1, 3, or 7 days of hypobaric hypoxia (380 Torr). ASIC transcript was not increased in the sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG). In the PG, CH also increased the expression of channel-interacting PDZ domain protein, a scaffolding protein known to enhance the surface expression and the low pH-induced current density mediated by ASIC3. Western immunoblot analysis showed that CH elevated ASIC3 protein in PG, but not in SCG or the (sensory) nodose ganglion. ASIC3 transcript was likewise elevated in PG neurons cultured in the presence of inflammatory cytokines. Increased ASIC expression was blocked in CH rats concurrently treated with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (4 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)). Electrophysiological recording of carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity in vitro showed that the specific ASIC antagonist A-317567 (100 μM) did not significantly alter hypoxia-evoked activity in normal preparations but blocked ∼50% of the hypoxic response following CH. Likewise, a high concentration of ibuprofen, which is known to block ASIC1a, reduced hypoxia-evoked CSN activity by ∼50% in CH preparations. Our findings indicate that CH induces inflammation-dependent phenotypic adjustments in chemoafferent neurons. Following CH, ASIC are important participants in chemotransmission between type I cells and chemoafferent nerve terminals, and these proton-gated channels appear to enhance chemoreceptor sensitivity.",2011,,"Liu X, He L, Dinger B, Fidone SJ.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3233826,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Identifying the mechanism of ibuprofen efficacy would aid in the development of new therapies that avoid these adverse events. Previous findings demonstrated that ibuprofen treatment restores the regulation of microtubule dynamics in CF epithelial cells through a 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism. The goal of this study is to define the AMPK pathway that leads to microtubule regulation. Here, it is identified that inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is the key step in mediating the AMPK effect. ACC inhibition with 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA) increases microtubule reformation rates in cultured and primary CF epithelial cells to wild-type (WT) rates. TOFA treatment also restores microtubule-dependent distribution of cholesterol and Rab7-positive organelles, as well as reduces expression of the proinflammatory signaling molecule RhoA to WT levels. ACC activation with citrate replicates these CF phenotypes in WT cells further supporting the role of AMPK signaling through ACC as a key mediator in CF cell signaling.

Alpert and R.W. Walenga. Am. J. Physiol. 269 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 13): L734-L743, 1995]. Formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured tracheobronchial epithelial cells during ozone exposure was recently demonstrated (L.C. Chen and Q.Qu. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 143: 96-101, 1997). In the present study, we investigated if ROS generated by ozone-exposed human TE cells contribute to PGE2 production and/or CO inactivation and whether the delay in recovery of CO activity after ozone reflects impaired gene transcription and/or protein synthesis. Rapid, dose-dependent ROS generation, assessed by fluorescence of dihydrorhodamine 123, was detected in human TE monolayers exposed to 0.21-0.63 ppm ozone. In a different system, TE cells were exposed to air or 0.5 ppm ozone for 1 h by serial renewal/collection of an adherent film of media. Ozone-induced ROS formation, the transient increase and decline in PGE2, and CO inactivation were attenuated by an intracellular hydroxyl radical scavenger, 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea. Ibuprofen, a reversible CO inhibitor, prevented PGE2 release during ozone exposure (and hence autocatalytic CO inactivation) but not loss of CO activity. Although CO activity remained depressed for hours after ozone exposure, compared with air-exposed cultures, no differences were detected in mRNA and protein levels of prostaglandin endoperoxide G/H synthase 2 (PGHS-2), the only CO isoform present in human TE cells, or in the rate of de novo PGHS-2 synthesis. Our findings suggest that ozone-induced PGE2 production and CO inactivation are primarily the result of formation of intracellular oxidant molecules and that delayed recovery of CO activity in human TE cells after short-term ozone exposure is due to persistent inactivation of PGHS-2, rather than to interference with its synthesis.",1997,,"Alpert SE, Walenga RW, Jaspers I, Qu Q, Chen LC.",https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.1997.272.5.L879,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The current study examines the hypothesis that CH initiates an immune response in the carotid body and that chemoreceptor hyperexcitability is dependent on the expression and action of inflammatory cytokines. CH resulted in a robust invasion of ED1(+) macrophages, which peaked on day 3 of exposure. Gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, was increased >2-fold after 1 day of hypoxia followed by a >2-fold increase in IL-6 on day 3. After 28 days of CH, IL-6 remained elevated >5-fold, whereas expression of other cytokines recovered to normal levels. Cytokine expression was not restricted to immune cells. Studies of cultured type I cells harvested following 1 day of in vivo hypoxia showed elevated transcript levels of inflammatory cytokines. In situ hybridization studies confirmed expression of IL-6 in type I cells and also showed that CH induces IL-6 expression in supporting type II cells. Concurrent treatment of CH rats with anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen or dexamethasone) blocked immune cell invasion and severely reduced CH-induced cytokine expression in carotid body.

Using a targeted lipidomics approach, we investigated circulating lipid mediator responses to resistance exercise and treatment with the NSAID ibuprofen. Human subjects undertook a single bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise (80% of one repetition maximum) following oral ingestion of ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo control. Venous blood was collected during early recovery (0-3 h and 24 h postexercise), and serum lipid mediator composition was analyzed by LC-MS-based targeted lipidomics. Postexercise recovery was characterized by elevated levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and 2-derived prostanoids (TXB2, PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, and PGI2), lipooxygenase (5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX)-derived hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and leukotrienes (e.g., LTB4), and epoxygenase (CYP)-derived epoxy/dihydroxy eicosatrienoic acids (EpETrEs/DiHETrEs). Additionally, we detected elevated levels of bioactive lipid mediators with anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties, including arachidonic acid-derived lipoxins (LXA4 and LXB4), and the EPA (E-series) and DHA (D-series)-derived resolvins (RvD1 and RvE1), and protectins (PD1 isomer 10S, 17S-diHDoHE). Ibuprofen treatment blocked exercise-induced increases in COX-1 and COX-2-derived prostanoids but also resulted in off-target reductions in leukotriene biosynthesis, and a diminished proresolving lipid mediator response. CYP pathway product metabolism was also altered by ibuprofen treatment, as indicated by elevated postexercise serum 5,6-DiHETrE and 8,9-DiHETrE only in those receiving ibuprofen.

These results highlight prostaglandin and myokine involvement in the adaptive response to exercise in older individuals and suggest two mechanisms underlying the enhanced muscle mass gains in the drug groups: 1) The drug-induced PGF(2α) receptor upregulation helped offset the drug suppression of PGF(2α)-stimulated protein synthesis after each exercise bout and enhanced skeletal muscle sensitivity to this stimulation. 2) The drug-induced suppression of intramuscular PGE(2) production increased net muscle protein balance after each exercise bout through a reduction in PGE(2)-induced IL-6 and MuRF-1, both promoters of muscle loss.",2013,,"Trappe TA, Standley RA, Jemiolo B, Carroll CC, Trappe SW.",https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00245.2012,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This report examines the role of EP receptors in mediating the effects of PGE2 on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell growth. The results indicate that activation of Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 by PGE2 results in increased growth, while EP1 activation is growth inhibitory. Indeed, two EP1 antagonists (ONO-8711 and SC51089) stimulate, rather than inhibit, MDCK cell growth, an effect that is lost following an EP1 knockdown. Similar observations were made with M1 collecting duct and rabbit kidney proximal tubule cells. ONO-8711 even stimulates growth in the absence of exogenous PGE2, an effect that is prevented by ibuprofen (indicating a dependence upon endogenous PGE2). The involvement of Akt was indicated by the observation that 1) ONO-8711 and SC51089 increase Akt phosphorylation, and 2) MK2206, an Akt inhibitor, prevents the increased growth caused by ONO-8711. The involvement of the EGF receptor (EGFR) was indicated by 1) the increased phosphorylation of the EGFR caused by SC51089 and 2) the loss of the growth-stimulatory effect of ONO-8711 and SC51089 caused by the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478. The growth-stimulatory effect of ONO-8711 was lost following an EGFR knockdown, and transduction of MDCK cells with a dominant negative EGFR.

However, the mechanisms mediating this hyperemic response remain unknown. The cyclooxygenase pathway is active in skeletal muscle, is heat sensitive, and contributes to cutaneous thermal hyperemia in young healthy humans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that cyclooxygenase inhibition would attenuate blood flow in the vastus lateralis muscle during localized heating. Twelve participants (6 women) were studied on two separate occasions: <i>1</i>) time control (i.e., no ibuprofen); and <i>2</i>) ingestion of 800 mg ibuprofen, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor.

Several in vitro studies suggest that cyclooxygenase-inhibiting drugs can alter tendon metabolism and may influence adaptations to resistance training. Thirty-six individuals were randomly assigned to a placebo (67 ± 2 yr old), acetaminophen (64 ± 1 yr old; 4,000 mg/day), or ibuprofen (64 ± 1 yr old; 1,200 mg/day) group in a double-blind manner and completed 12 wk of knee extensor resistance training. Before and after training in vivo patellar tendon properties were assessed with MRI [cross-sectional area (CSA) and signal intensity] and ultrasonography of patellar tendon deformation coupled with force measurements to obtain stiffness, modulus, stress, and strain. Mean patellar tendon CSA was unchanged (P > 0.05) with training in the placebo group, and this response was not influenced with ibuprofen consumption. Mean tendon CSA increased with training in the acetaminophen group (3%, P < 0.05), primarily due to increases in the mid (7%, P < 0.05) and distal (8%, P < 0.05) tendon regions. Correspondingly, tendon signal intensity increased with training in the acetaminophen group at the mid (13%, P < 0.05) and distal (15%, P = 0.07) regions. When normalized to pretraining force levels, patellar tendon deformation and strain decreased 11% (P < 0.05) and stiffness, modulus, and stress were unchanged (P > 0.05) with training in the placebo group. These responses were generally uninfluenced by ibuprofen consumption. In the acetaminophen group, tendon deformation and strain increased 20% (P < 0.05) and stiffness (-17%, P < 0.05) and modulus (-20%, P < 0.05) decreased with training. These data suggest that 3 mo of knee extensor resistance training in older adults induces modest changes in the mechanical properties of the patellar tendon.

Conversely, certain profound congenital cardiac malformations require the DA to be patent until corrective surgery can be performed. In each instance, clinicians have a very limited repertoire of therapeutic options at their disposal - indomethacin or ibuprofen to close a patent DA (PDA) and prostaglandin E1 to maintain patency of the DA. Neither treatment is specific to the DA and both may have deleterious off-target effects. Therefore, more therapeutic options specifically targeted to the DA should be considered. We hypothesized the DA possesses a unique genetic signature that would set it apart from other vessels. A microarray was used to compare the genetic profiles of the murine DA and ascending aorta (AO). Over 4,000 genes were differentially expressed between these vessels including a subset of ion channel-related genes. Specifically, the alpha and beta subunits of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels are enriched in the DA. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed inhibition of BKCa channels caused the DA to constrict, while activation caused DA relaxation even in the presence of O2. This study identifies subsets of genes that are enriched in the DA that may be used to develop DA-specific drugs. Ion channels that regulate DA tone, including BKCa channels, are promising targets.

MED,20041017,20041017,10.1155/2009/424192,Pediatric migraine.,"Migraine is the most common cause of acute recurrent headaches in children. The pathophysiological concepts have evolved from a purely vascular etiology to a neuroinflammatory process. Clinical evaluation is the mainstay of diagnosis and should also include family history. Investigations help to rule out secondary causes. The role of new drugs in treatment of migraine is discussed and trials are quoted from literature. Indications for starting prophylaxis should be evaluated based on frequency of attacks and influence on quality of life. For management of acute attacks of migraine both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are recommended for use in children. Many drugs like antiepileptic drugs (AED), calcium channel blockers, and antidepressants have been used for prophylaxis of migraine in children. The data for use of newer drugs for migraine in children is limited, though AEDs are emerging a popular choice. Biofeedback and other nonmedicinal therapies are being used with promising results.",2009,,"Shah UH, Kalra V.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2009/424192,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Flavocoxid titrated into rat peritoneal macrophage cultures inhibited cellular phospholipase A2 (PLA(2)) (IC(50) = 60 μg/mL). In in vitro enzyme assays, flavocoxid showed little anti-cyclooxygenase (CO) activity on COX-1/-2 enzymes, but inhibited the COX-1 (IC(50) = 12.3) and COX-2 (IC(50) = 11.3 μg/mL) peroxidase (PO) moieties as well as 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) (IC(50) = 110 μg/mL). No detectable 5-LOX inhibition was found for multiple traditional and COX-2 selective NSAIDs. Flavocoxid also exhibited strong and varied antioxidant capacities in vitro and decreased nitrite levels (IC(50) = 38 μg/mL) in rat peritoneal macrophages. Finally, in contrast to celecoxib and ibuprofen, which upregulated the cox-2 gene, flavocoxid strongly decreased expression. This work suggests that clinically favourable effects of flavocoxid for management of osteoarthritis (OA) are achieved by simultaneous modification of multiple molecular pathways relating to AA metabolism, oxidative induction of inflammation, and neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS).",2011,,"Burnett BP, Bitto A, Altavilla D, Squadrito F, Levy RM, Pillai L.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2011/385780.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of IL-1α production in the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to induce IL-1α in HaCaT cells, and this might be associated with the specific deficiency known to affect downstream signalling of the MEK/ERK pathway in these cells. The calcium ionophore, ionomycin, slightly enhanced the production of intracellular (icIL-1α), but this resulted in a necrotic release at higher concentrations. UV-B exposure significantly increased the production of icIL-1α in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal induction exhibited at 24 h with minimal necrotic and apoptotic effects. Validation of the HaCaT cell model indicated that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ibuprofen, and the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibited icIL-1α production, and this was associated with a slight inhibition of cell viability.

Here we describe our current work investigating how the serotonergic network in the brain is disrupted in a rodent model of preterm hypoxia-ischemia. One week after postnatal day 3 hypoxia-ischemia, losses of serotonergic raphé neurons, reductions in serotonin levels in the brain, and reduced serotonin transporter expression are evident. These changes can be prevented using two anti-inflammatory interventions; the postinsult administration of minocycline or ibuprofen. However, each drug has its own limitations and benefits for use in neonates to stem damage to the serotonergic network after hypoxia-ischemia.

Methods. Ibuprofen loaded SMEDDS (ISMEDDS) was developed and was characterized. The permeability behavior of Ibuprofen over three different concentrations (20, 30, and 40 µg/mL) was studied in each isolated region of rat intestine by SPIP method at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The human intestinal permeability was predicted using the Lawrence compartment absorption and transit (CAT) model since effective permeability coefficients (P eff) values for rat are highly correlated with those of human, and comparative intestinal permeability of Ibuprofen was carried out with plain drug suspension (PDS) and marketed formulation (MF). Results. The developed ISMEDDS was stable, emulsified upon mild agitation with 44.4 nm ± 2.13 and 98.86% ± 1.21 as globule size and drug content, respectively. Higher P eff in colon with no significant P eff difference in jejunum, duodenum, and ileum was observed.

After the patient was stabilized, in addition to the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) overdose Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia were diagnosed. We report this case to illustrate that the initial presentation of meningitis may be extremely unusual especially in the setting of NSAID overdose and the acutely decompensating patient.

The concentration of ibuprofen which was incorporated as an acetone solution or as a suspension in a sodium carboxymethylcellulose dispersion was 0.5 mg/cm(2) and 1.0 mg/cm(2) of film. Results showed that developed films had adequate mechanical and swelling properties and an advantageous acidic surface pH for wound application. An in vitro drug release study implied that layered films retained the drug for a longer period of time and thus could minimize the frequency of changing the dressing.

A 44-year-old man developed generalized exanthema with increasing exfoliation and mucosal involvement after taking allopurinol, ibuprofen, and etoricoxib. The clinical diagnosis of TEN was histologically confirmed. Prednisolone therapy with 3 mg/kg body weight (BW) was not able to prevent further progress to finally 80% of the body surface, and infliximab 5 mg/kg BW was given as a single dose. This prevented further progression of the TEN. Despite marked improvement in skin findings, the ICU stay was prolonged by a complex analgosedation, transient kidney failure, volume management, positioning therapy, and vegetatively impeded weaning.

NSAIDs have been associated with hepatic side effects; however, the frequency of these side effects is uncertain.<h4>Aim of the review</h4>To systematically review published literature on randomized, controlled trials that assessed the risk of clinically significant hepatotoxicity associated with NSAIDs.<h4>Methods</h4>Searches of bibliographic databases EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were conducted up to July 30, 2016, to identify randomized controlled trials of ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, piroxicam, meloxicam, mefenamic acid, indomethacin, celecoxib, and etoricoxib in adults with any disease that provide information on hepatotoxicity outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 698 studies, 18 studies met the selection criteria. However, only 8 studies regarding three NSAIDs (celecoxib, etoricoxib, and diclofenac) demonstrated clinically significant hepatotoxic evidence based on hepatotoxicity justification criteria. Of all the hepatotoxicity events found from the above-mentioned three NSAIDs, diclofenac had the highest proportion, which ranged from 0.015 to 4.3 (×10<sup>-2</sup>), followed by celecoxib, which ranged from 0.13 to 0.38 (×10<sup>-2</sup>), and etoricoxib, which ranged from 0.005 to 0.930 (×10<sup>-2</sup>).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Diclofenac had higher rates of hepatotoxic evidence compared to other NSAIDs.

Therefore, acupuncture has been used as an alternative therapy to relieve the symptoms of PD. In clinical practice, a penetrating method of acupuncture with long needle has been shown to be particularly effective for improving primary dysmenorrhea. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique for pain relief in patients with primary dysmenorrhea as compared with a conventional pain medication.<h4>Methods</h4>The present study is a perspective, randomized, ibuprofen-controlled trial. Sixty-two eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either acupuncture treatment or ibuprofen administration. The treatment lasted for three menstrual cycles for both groups. The primary outcome was the intensity of menstrual pain measured by using the visual analogue scale at the completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes included the severity of symptoms associated with menstrual pain, responder rate, and safety of acupuncture treatment. The clinical outcomes were measured on each menstrual cycle at baseline, treatment course (3 cycles), and follow-up period.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-four patients of primary dysmenorrhea were recruited, and 62 subjects were included in the final analysis. At trial completion, acupuncture was shown to be associated with a significantly lower pain intensity and decreased symptom severity of primary dysmenorrhea as compared with ibuprofen (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A significantly higher responder rate was found in the acupuncture group as compared with the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported by patients in either group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The penetrating method of acupuncture with long needle may be an effective and safe therapy for pain relief in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.

In HIV-infected individuals, increased HIV-associated immune activation significantly correlated to disease progression. While genital inflammation (GI) has been shown to significantly increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission, immune correlates for reduced risk remain limited. In certain HIV-exposed seronegative individuals, an immune quiescent phenotype characterized reduced risk. Immune quiescence is defined by specific, targeted, highly regulated immune responses that hinder overt inflammation or immune activation. Targeted management of inflammation, therefore, is a plausible strategy to mitigate HIV risk and slow disease progression. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as hydroxychloroquine and aspirin have shown encouraging preliminary results in low-risk women by reducing systemic and genital immune activation. A topical NSAID, containing ibuprofen, is effective in treating vulvovaginal inflammation. Additionally, the glucocorticoids (GCs), prednisolone, and dexamethasone are used to treat HIV-associated immune activation. Collectively, these data inform on immune-modulating drugs to reduce HIV risk. However, the prolonged use of these pharmaceutical drugs is associated with adverse effects, both systemically and to a lesser extent topically. Natural products with their reduced side effects coupled with anti-inflammatory properties render them viable options. Lactic acid (LA) has immunomodulatory properties. LA regulates the genital microbiome by facilitating the growth of <i>Lactobacillus</i> species, while simultaneously limiting bacterial species that cause microbial dysbiosis and GI. Glycerol monolaurate, besides being anti-inflammatory, also inhibited SIV infections in rhesus macaques. The proposed pharmaceutical and natural products could be used in combination with either antiretrovirals for treatment or preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention. This review provides a summary on the associations between inflammation, HIV risk, and disease progression.

Compared with other sports injuries, the injuries caused by piano practice are mainly chronic injuries caused by long-term strain of the upper limbs, and acute injuries rarely occur. The purpose of this study was to analyze the therapeutic effect of hand muscle injury caused by piano practice.<h4>Method</h4>A total of 60 patients with hand muscle injury caused by piano practice admitted to our hospital from January 2019 to June 2020 were selected. According to the number random grouping method, they were randomly divided into two groups. There were 30 patients in the observation group, including 20 males and 10 females, aged 24-53 (39.51 ± 7.01) years old, and the course of disease was 1-5 (3.24 ± 1.62) months. In the control group, there were 30 patients, including 18 males and 12 females, aged 24-56 (39.62 ± 7.17) years old, and the course of disease was 1.5-5 (3.14 ± 1.71) months. If the observation group experienced excessive pain, the group took ibuprofen sustained-release capsules. On weekdays, exercise your fingers 2-3 times per day. After the intervention, the wrist joint function score of the observation group was higher than that before the intervention.<h4>Results</h4>Before treatment, there was no significant difference in pain level scores between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). After treatment, the limb pain score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group. The effective rate of hand tendon rehabilitation in the observation group was 93.33%.

It is almost always present after orthognathic surgeries (OGS), but its severity is subjective in each patient. Postoperative care of the patient is aimed at minimizing of postoperative pain relief orofacial region. Options of physiotherapy include extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) and high-energy light-emitting diode (LED). <i>Aim of the Study</i>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapy combining ELF EMF and LED to reduce pain of the orofacial region in patients after OGS. <i>Material and Methods</i>. The study was conducted in thirty-two patients who underwent OGS to treat morphological defects. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: Physiotherapy group (PT) and Control group (CG). In both groups, patients were prescribed Paracetamol and nonsteroidal analgesics (NSAID-ibuprofen). Patients from the PT group additionally received postoperative physiotherapy immediately after leaving the surgical clinic in the form of ELF EMF and LED therapy. Physiotherapeutic treatments were performed for 10 days, three applications a day, at no cost to the patient. Pain intensity was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a reliable instrument for the measurement of pain intensity self-reported by the patient.<h4>Results</h4>Faster reduction of pain was the major observation made in patients who received physiotherapy treatments. In all subjects, after 5 days of therapy, the pain intensity was reduced by about 50% or resolved completely. Effects of therapy were measured with the relative changes in the pain intensity score, showing what fraction of the initial pain was eliminated at the first stage and throughout the whole therapy. The analysis of relative changes instead of absolute changes allowed us, among other things, to eliminate the bias of the higher initial pain intensity in the CG group compared to the PT group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The conducted research revealed that the combined use of ELF EMF and LED is beneficial in the reduction of pain of patients after OGS. The analgesic effects of physiotherapy in the treatment after OGS are necessary to continue research in this area and analyze the possibility of extending the indications for its use in other surgically treated maxillofacial diseases.",2022,,"Lietz-Kijak D, Ardan R.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/prm/2022/3115154.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

ASD containing optimized drug-polymer ratio prepared by freeze-drying (FD) method was characterized and compared physicochemically. The solubility of IBP in water increased 28-fold and 35-fold when formulated as ASD by MF and FD, respectively. Precise formulations showed amorphization of IBP and increased surface area, improving solubility. The dissolution pattern of optimized ASD-IBP in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer after 60 min in MF and FD was enhanced 3-fold. In addition, direct compression tablets comprising optimized ASD granules from MF and FD were made and assessed using compendial and noncompendial methods. ASD-IBP/MF and ASD-IBP/FD formulations showed a similar drug release profile. In addition, 12 h of sustained IBP release from the ASD-IBP-containing tablets was obtained in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6.8. From the dissolution kinetics analysis, the Weibull model fitted well. The drug release pattern indicated minimal variations between tablets formed using ASD-IBP prepared by both procedures; however, pre- and postcompression assessment parameters differed. From these findings, the application of ASD and sustained-release polymers in matrix formation might be beneficial in improving the solubility and absorption of poorly soluble drugs such as IBP.",2024,,"Uddin A, Halder S, Deb N, Das H, Shuma ML, Hasan I, Shill MC, Haider SS.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/2303942,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The present study was undertaken to explore if linking of nitrooxyethyl ester to ibuprofen reverses its healing-depressant propensity. Nitrooxyethyl ester of ibuprofen (NOE-Ibu) was synthesized in our laboratory through a well-established synthetic pathway. NOE-Ibu was screened for its influence on collagenation, wound contraction and epithelialization phases of healing, and scar size of healed wound in three wound models, namely, incision, dead space, and excision wounds. Besides, its influence on the oxidative stress (levels of GSH and TBARS) was also determined in 10-day-old granulation tissue. NOE-Ibu was further screened for its antiinflammatory activity in rat paw edema model. NOE-Ibu promoted collagenation (increase in breaking strength, granulation weight, and collagen content), wound contraction and epithelialization phases of healing. NOE-Ibu also showed a significant antioxidant effect in 10-day-old granulation tissue as compared to ibuprofen. Results vindicate that the esterification of ibuprofen with nitrooxyethyl group reverses the healing-suppressant effect of ibuprofen.

Angiogenesis was measured by in vitro endothelial cell tube formation and immunohistochemistry.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen significantly inhibited cell proliferation in mouse (MC-26) and human (HT-29) colorectal cancer cell lines. In vitro angiogenesis assays also indicated that ibuprofen decreased both cell proliferation and tube formation. The administration of chow containing 1,360 ppm ibuprofen, which achieved an average plasma concentration of ibuprofen lower than the peak level achieved in humans at therapeutic doses, inhibited tumor growth by 40% to 82%. Fewer liver metastases were found in the ibuprofen group compared with the control group. In combination therapy with the standard antineoplastic agents, 5-fluorouracil, or irinotecan (CPT-11), tumor volumes in the groups with ibuprofen +/- CPT-11 or 5-fluorouracil were smaller than in the control group. Ibuprofen was similar to the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib in its ability to suppress tumor growth and improve overall survival.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen, in part by modulating tumor angiogenesis, decreases both tumor growth and metastatic potential in mice. The ibuprofen doses were in the low range of therapeutic human plasma concentrations.

Previously, we showed that treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen induced p75(NTR) expression in several prostate cancer cell lines leading to p75(NTR)-mediated decreased survival. Using the 2-phenyl propionic acid moiety of these profens as a pharmacophore, we screened an in silico database of 30 million compounds and identified carprofen as having an order of magnitude greater activity for induction of p75(NTR) levels and inhibition of cell survival. Prostate (PC-3 and DU-145) and bladder (T24) cancer cells were more sensitive to carprofen induction of p75(NTR)-associated loss of survival than breast (MCF-7) and fibroblast (3T3) cells. Transfection of prostate cell lines with a dominant-negative form of p75(NTR) before carprofen treatment partially rescued cell survival, showing a cause-and-effect relationship between carprofen induction of p75(NTR) levels and inhibition of survival. Carprofen induced apoptotic nuclear fragmentation in prostate but not in MCF-7 and 3T3 cells. Furthermore, small interfering RNA knockdown of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein prevented induction of p75(NTR) by carprofen in both prostate cell lines. Carprofen treatment induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as early as within 1 min. Expression of a dominant-negative form of MK2, the kinase downstream of p38 MAPK frequently associated with signaling cascades leading to apoptosis, prevented carprofen induction of the p75(NTR) protein.

The top 3 networks for both NSAIDs included functional categories of DNA replication, recombination and repair, and gastrointestinal disease. Immunoresponse function was specific to NS-398, and cell cycle and cellular movement were among the top functions for ibuprofen. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis also identified renal and urologic disease as a function specific for ibuprofen. This comprehensive study identified several COX-2-independent targets of NSAIDs, which may help explain the antitumor and radiosensitizing effects of NSAIDs.

The biologic outcome of signaling through a network is inherently more robust and resistant to inhibition of a single network component. In this study, we conducted a functional chemical genetic screen to identify novel interactions between signaling inhibitors that would not be predicted on the basis of our current understanding of signaling networks. We screened over 300 drug combinations in nine melanoma cell lines and have identified pairs of compounds that show synergistic cytotoxicity. The synergistic cytotoxicities identified did not correlate with the known RAS and BRAF mutational status of the melanoma cell lines. Among the most robust results was synergy between sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with activity against RAF, and diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Drug substitution experiments using the NSAIDs celecoxib and ibuprofen or the MAP-ERK kinase inhibitor PD325901 and the RAF inhibitor RAF265 suggest that inhibition of COX and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling are targets for the synergistic cytotoxicity of sorafenib and diclofenac. Cotreatment with sorafenib and diclofenac interrupts a positive feedback signaling loop involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase, cellular phospholipase A2, and COX.

Expression of p75(NTR) is lost as prostate cancer progresses and is minimal in several metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. NSAIDs induce p75(NTR) through activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, with a concomitant decrease in cell survival. Here, we show that treatment with R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen induces expression of the NSAID-activated gene-1 (Nag-1) protein, a divergent member of the TGF beta (TGF-β) family, in PC-3 cells. Using the selective pharmacologic inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190, and p38 MAPK-specific siRNA (small interfering RNA), we show that Nag-1 induction following NSAID treatment is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. p75(NTR)-specific siRNA pretreatment shows that Nag-1 induction by NSAIDs is downstream of p75(NTR) induction. Decreased survival of NSAID-treated cells is rescued by p75(NTR)-specific siRNA but not by Nag-1 siRNA. Transwell chamber and in vitro wound healing assays demonstrate decreased cell migration upon NSAID treatment. Pretreatment of PC-3 cells with p75(NTR) and Nag-1-specific siRNA shows that NSAID inhibition of cell migration is mediated by Nag-1 and p75(NTR).

Although these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often associated with gastrointestinal toxicity, there is renewed interest in their use as colorectal cancer (CRC) chemopreventive agents due to the adverse side effects associated with long-term use of selective COX-2 inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term use (up to 25 years) of NSAIDs (ibuprofen or aspirin) on adenoma pathology and β-catenin-mediated signaling in sporadic human colon adenomas. Although NSAID use did not impact overall adenoma size or degree of dysplasia, it did cause a significant inhibition of nuclear β-catenin localization, which correlated with suppression of cyclin D1 expression. To further elucidate the effect of these agents in regulating β-catenin, we treated SW480 colon cancer cells with a panel of NSAIDs and determined their effects on β-catenin levels and cellular localization. In agreement with our in vivo results, both S-ibuprofen and aspirin were found to decrease total levels of β-catenin while increasing its phosphorylation. In addition, S-ibuprofen induced both degradation of IκBα and nuclear localization of NF-κB. Despite its nuclear localization, however, the activation of the NF-κB target genes, Bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was suppressed. This reduction in NF-κB transcriptional activity may be due to increased phosphorylation of GSK-3β following S-ibuprofen treatment. These data suggest that ibuprofen can effectively target both the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways, and potentially uncovers a novel mechanism through which NSAIDS may exert their chemopreventive efficacy.",2011,,"Greenspan EJ, Madigan JP, Boardman LA, Rosenberg DW.",https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-10-0021,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuleve gel (Dermal Laboratories, UK) contained only ibuprofen whilst Deep Relief gel (Mentholatum, UK) also contained 3% menthol. In contrast to results obtained when these products were compared under in vitro conditions, there was no statistically significant difference in vivo between delivery of ibuprofen.

Ibuprofen was administered intravenously at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg at the time of coronary artery occlusion and again 2.5 h later. Ibuprofen significantly prevented the loss of myocardial creatine phosphokinase (CPK) release in ischemic cardiac tissue. In addition, this drug significantly returned S-T segment elevation toward normal values, and significantly prevented the myocardial loss of compounds having free amino nitrogen groups, an index of proteolysis. Although ibuprofen moderated the increased plasma CPK activity, plasma CPK values 5 h after coronary occlusion were above control values.

The possibility of ibuprofen self-association was also examined. As the amount of ethanol was raised from 0 to 100%, ibuprofen solubility was enhanced 5,500-fold relative to its aqueous solubility. Up to 50%, the pK(a) of ibuprofen shifted from 4.44 to 5.68. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of ibuprofen in both monomer and dimer forms in vehicles containing 75 and 100% ethanol. In silicone membranes, the flux of ibuprofen increased 8-fold over the range of ethanol concentrations studied (0-100%) relative to aqueous solutions, with the highest flux observed for 100% ethanol. However, in skin, the flux of ibuprofen was optimal for 50:50 and 75:25 ethanol-water vehicles (>10-fold flux enhancement).

A correlation (r = 0.9603, p < 0.001) between the amount of drug in the epidermis expressed as micrograms per milligram of epidermal protein and the corresponding inhibition of the inflammation was observed. Increasing the amount of drug in the epidermis correlated with an increased inhibition of the inflammation.

Propylene glycol (PG) has a long history of use as a component of topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations. In the present study we investigated the influence of PG on the solubility and membrane permeability characteristics of ibuprofen in silicone and skin using binary (PG:water) and ternary (ethanol:PG:water) solvent systems. Fluxes were maximum for 70:30 PG:water systems in silicone membrane; however, for experiments conducted with skin, the flux of ibuprofen systematically increased with increasing amounts of PG. For silicone membrane, the flux values of ibuprofen from ternary ethanol:PG:water (25:25:50 and 50:25:25) systems were 1.2- and 1.5-fold higher than the highest values observed from the PG:water systems. A comparison of the data from occluded versus non-occluded studies suggested that the ethanol content was the critical determinant of flux enhancement in these systems. For human skin, a PG:water (50:50) mixture enhanced ibuprofen flux to the same extent as the corresponding ethanol:PG:water (25:25:50) system. However, the ternary system, ethanol:PG:water (50:25:25), demonstrated the greatest enhancement. An analysis of the partition and diffusion parameters for experiments conducted with skin confirmed that the influence of PG in the PG:water systems is primarily on the solubility and partitioning behaviour of ibuprofen.

The solubility of ibuprofen was 5-fold higher in MG than in MO, however, the permeation of ibuprofen from the pure vehicles and combinations of both was comparable in silicone membrane. Additionally, there were no significant differences in skin permeation for MO and MG vehicles. When the permeation of various hydrophilic and lipophilic vehicles is considered, a trend between flux values for the model membrane and skin is evident (r(2) = 0.71). The findings suggest that silicone membrane may provide information on qualitative trends in skin permeation for vehicles of diverse solubility and partition characteristics.",2011,,"Watkinson RM, Guy RH, Oliveira G, Hadgraft J, Lane ME.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000315139,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Optimization of topical drug formulations by the addition of penetration enhancers may facilitate the passage of drugs through the stratum corneum.<h4>Methods</h4>In this paper, the skin penetration effect of phytosphingosine and 9 derived phytoceramides (PCERs) on 3 transdermal model drugs (i.e. caffeine, testosterone, ibuprofen) was investigated via Franz diffusion cell experiments using split-thickness human skin. Azone was included as a positive control.<h4>Results</h4>The main finding in our study was that the PCERs exerted a compound-dependent penetration-enhancing effect. Some of the investigated PCERs exhibited a penetration-enhancing ratio of more than 2 (mean ± SE): for caffeine PCER1 (2.48 ± 0.44), PCER2 (2.75 ± 0.74), PCER3 (2.62 ± 0.93) and PCER6 (2.70 ± 0.45) and for testosterone PCER1 (2.08 ± 0.56), PCER2 (2.56 ± 0.13), PCER3 (3.48), PCER4 (2.53), PCER5 (2.04 ± 0.14), PCER6 (2.05 ± 0.48) and PCER10 (4.84 ± 0.79), but none of them had an influence on ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The investigated PCERs exhibited a penetration-enhancing effect on caffeine and testosterone but not on ibuprofen.",2015,,"Veryser L, Boonen J, Taevernier L, Guillaume J, Risseeuw M, Shah SN, Roche N, Van Calenbergh S, De Spiegeleer B.",https://doi.org/10.1159/000365730,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Five groups of rabbits were orally administered with 25 mg/kg of IBU nanosuspension, nanoparticles, unhomogenized suspension, marketed product, and untreated suspension. A sixth group received 5 mg/kg IBU intravenously. Blood samples obtained were analyzed by chromatography.<h4>Results</h4>The nanosuspensions showed significant decrease in particle size. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PP) K30 profoundly increased aqueous solubility of IBU. Addition of Tween 80 (TW), in equal amount as PP (IBU:PP:TW, 1:2:2 w/w), resulted in much smaller particle size and better dissolution rate. The Cmax values achieved were 14.8 ± 1.64, 11.1 ± 1.37, 9.01 ± 0.761, 7.03 ± 1.38, and 3.23 ± 1.03 μg/mL, and the tmax values were 36 ± 8.2, 39 ± 8.2, 100 ± 17.3, 112 ± 15, and 105 ± 17 min for the nanosuspension, nanoparticle, unhomogenized suspension, marketed IBU suspension, and untreated IBU suspension in water, respectively. Bioavailability of the different formulations relative to the marketed suspension was found to be in the following sequence: nanosuspension > unhomogenized suspension > nanoparticles > untreated IBU suspension.<h4>Conclusion</h4>IBU/PP/TW nanosuspension showed enhanced in vitro and in vivo performance as compared to the marketed product.

In 45 dogs, heparin did not prevent these flow reductions, but ibuprofen (Motrin) or indomethacin abolished them. With incremental doses of each of these drugs, the cyclical flow reduction and the platelet function in vitro were diminished proportionately. In 10 more dogs, during low flow, pinching or poking the narrowed vessel suddenly restored normal flow. Topical application of papaverine and nitroglycerin proximal to the stenosis did not abolish the cyclic flow reduction, although a transient fall in systemic pressure indicated that they had been absorbed. Seven dogs had the constricting cylinder and flow probe chronically implanted for 4-6 weeks. A single oral dose of aspirin, 20 mg/kg, abolished their cyclic flow reductions for 2-4 days. In five dogs with 70% stenosis in the circumflex coronary artery, coronary arteriography was performed before coronary flow reduction and when coronary blood flow was low. This showed that there was a considerable additional reduction in the size of the mechanically constricted lumen during spontaneous flow reduction. In one dog, a nonopacified mass was dislodged from the area of constriction in 67 msec and this restored the lumen to its control diameter. Similar rapid clearing was filmed in two more dogs. In no case was vasospasm observed. These results suggest that obstruction from platelets aggregated in the narrowed lumen caused the cyclic flow reductions.",1982,,"Folts JD, Gallagher K, Rowe GG.",https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.CIR.65.2.248,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Participation of the cyclooxygenase pathway.,"Human peripheral blood leukocytes, activated by phorbol myristate acetate, disrupt canine sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport, in vitro, by an oxygen-derived free radical mechanism. Activated leukocytes significantly depress Ca++ uptake activity and Ca++ -stimulated, Mg++ -dependent ATPase activity. The depression is completely inhibited by sodium-azide (0.1 mM) or the combination of superoxide dismutase (10 micrograms/ml) and catalase (10 micrograms/ml). Exogenous hydrogen peroxide (0.441-4.41 mM) uncoupled Ca++ uptake activity from ATP hydrolysis, and this effect was inhibited by catalase. Mannitol alone did not inhibit the effects of activated leukocytes, but superoxide plus mannitol (20-100 mM) resulted in normal ATPase activity, while Ca++ uptake remained depressed. In the presence of indomethacin and ibuprofen, activated leukocytes depressed Ca++ uptake and had no effect on ATPase activity. 2-Amino-methyl-4-t-butyl-6-iodophenol (MK-447) further depressed Ca++ uptake and partially inhibited the effect on ATPase activity. Indomethacin plus catalase completely inhibited the effects of activated leukocytes on cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. We conclude, first, that activated leukocytes depress canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ transport by an oxygen-free radical mechanism with the generation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. In addition to the classical membrane NADPH oxidase system, significant oxygen radical generation can occur through the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, and seems to be responsible for the generation of the hydroxyl radical.",1983,,"Rowe GT, Manson NH, Caplan M, Hess ML.",https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/01.RES.53.5.584,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A glucometer point-of-care measurement revealed a profound hypoglycaemia (1.9 mmol/L). Treatment with intravenous glucose was started and the patient was transported to the hospital. The patient had several episodes of pulseless electrical activity requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance and upon arrival in the hospital. Despite continuous glucose infusion the hypoglycaemia was difficult to correct during the next few hours and the patient developed hypokalaemia. Further investigation to identify the cause of hypoglycaemia revealed that insulin and C-peptide were inappropriately raised. A toxicological investigation revealed the presence of tramadol and its metabolites in lethal concentrations. Also acetaminophen, ibuprofen and lormetazepam were present. Ethanol screening was negative (< 0.1 g/L) and no sulfonylurea were detected. The patient developed multiple organ failure, but eventually recovered.<h4>What happened</h4>The hypoglycaemia was caused by inappropriate stimulation of insulin secretion in a patient intoxicated with tramadol. The sudden hypokalaemia was caused by a massive intracellular shift of potassium in response to the hyperinsulinemia, triggered by the intravenous administration of glucose.<h4>Main lesson</h4>To our knowledge, we are the first to document a significant rise in endogenous insulin production in a hypoglycaemic patient presenting with tramadol intoxication. Our observation suggests that hyperinsulinemia could be the cause of the hypoglycaemia associated with tramadol use.",2020,,"Schiemsky T, Vundelinckx G, Croes K, Penders J, Desmet K, Pauwels S, Vermeersch P.",https://doi.org/10.11613/BM.2020.010802,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The electrospun membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), mechanical evaluation and contact angle measurements. Shrinkage behavior of the membrane in buffer at 37 degrees C was also evaluated. It was found that PLGA glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased with increasing PEG-g-CHN content in the composite membranes, which results in a decrease in tensile stress at break but an increase in tensile strain of the membranes. The degree of shrinkage of these composite membranes decreased from 76 to only 3% when the PEG-g-CHN content in the membranes increased from 10 to 30%. The presence of PEG-g-CHN significantly moderated the burst release rate of ibuprofen from the electrospun PLGA membranes. Moreover, ibuprofen could be conjugated to the side chains of PEG-g-CHN to prolong its release for more than two weeks.

Analysis of bradykinin binding site distribution and secretory responses in vitro and in vivo.,"Bradykinin (BK) and lysyl-BK (lys-BK, kallidin) have been proposed as potentially important mediators of rhinorrhea. Possible mechanisms by which BK might contribute to rhinorrhea were investigated by several approaches. (1) The autoradiographic distribution of 125I-BK binding sites in human inferior turbinate nasal mucosa was determined. (2) The effects of BK and lys-BK and antagonists on radiolabeled respiratory glycoconjugate (RGC) release from human nasal mucosa was measured. (3) The secretory effects of BK were studied in cat tracheal mucosa maintained in short-term explant culture, and in ferret trachea maintained in Ussing chambers. (4) The effects of BK on macromolecule secretion in guinea pig nasal mucosa was studied in vivo. Autoradiographic examination of human nasal mucosa revealed that 125I-BK specifically bound to small muscular arteries, venous sinusoids, and submucosal fibers. No specific binding to submucosal glands or goblet cells was noted. Human nasal fragments secreted significantly increased amounts of RGC in response to 10 microM BK (15.0% +/- 1.8 compared with control values; mean +/- standard error of the mean; n = 7; p less than 0.01 by Student's unpaired t test), 10 microM lys-BK (12.2% +/- 3.3; n = 5; p less than 0.05), and 100 microM methacholine (35.7% +/- 2.3; p less than 0.0001). The addition of 1 microM BK, or 1 microM lys-BK, did not induce release.

MED,7697256,7697256,10.1164/ajrccm/151.4.1218,Paradoxic effect of ibuprofen on neutrophil accumulation in pulmonary and cutaneous inflammation.,"Evidence exists to suggest that the local accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary inflammation occurs by a different mechanism than in other microvascular beds. In the present study, this suggestion was investigated using the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen. This drug was used because in addition to inhibiting cyclooxygenase, it prevents several aspects of neutrophil function, including adhesion. Local inflammation in the lung and skin of the same rabbits was induced by the administration of C5a, and the effect of intravenous injection of ibuprofen on the accumulation of neutrophils at these two sites was examined. In the skin, neutrophil accumulation was inhibited by ibuprofen, and this appeared to be independent of cyclooxygenase blockade. A possible mechanism was prevention of neutrophil adherence to endothelium in postcapillary venules, and in vitro experiments showed that ibuprofen could entirely prevent neutrophil adherence, in addition to suppressing azurophil granule secretion and superoxide anion generation. However, the effect on adherence appeared to be independent of expression of the CD11/CD18 adhesion complex on the neutrophil. By contrast, in the pulmonary circulation of the same rabbit, C5a-induced neutrophil accumulation was enhanced by ibuprofen treatment. This was suggested to result from the prevention of thromboxane production, which normally serves to decrease local pulmonary blood flow to diminish delivery of neutrophils to the inflammatory site. Ibuprofen had no effect on retention of neutrophils in filters (models of pulmonary capillaries), suggesting that the drug was not enhancing the retention of neutrophils in capillaries on the first pass through the lung. Thus, it was possible that enhancement in the lung was caused by an increase in neutrophil supply. Because the accumulation of neutrophils in the skin is known to be dependent on the adherence phenomena, the paradoxic effects of ibuprofen on inflammation suggest that mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of neutrophils in cutaneous and pulmonary microcirculations are different.",1995,,"Hellewell PG, Young SK, Henson PM, Worthen GS.",https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.151.4.7697256,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Calu-3 cell monolayers were cultured on permeable supports at an air-liquid interface. Apical surface fluid (ASF) was collected by washing; antibacterial activity was assayed by incubating ASF washings with bacteria for 18 h and counting surviving colony-forming units. ASF washings killed Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibacterial activity was salt sensitive and dependent on protein concentration. After washing, approximately 30 h were required before antibacterial activity recovered to its initial level. After culturing with topical corticosteroids (budesonide, triamcinolone, or beclomethasone, 0.1 microg/ml for 48 h), ASF antibacterial activity was 4- to 10-fold greater than the ASF from control monolayers. The increase in antibacterial activity was dose-dependent. The beta(2)-agonists salbutamol and terbutaline (100 microg/ml for 48 h) decreased ASF antibacterial activity by 5- to 8-fold. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ibuprofen and cromolyn sodium had no effect. Our results are most consistent with agonist-dependent changes in the composition of ASF antibacterial proteins.

Cellulose acetate/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (CA/PVP) blends were used to fabricate uniform nanofibers. Investigations on the physicochemical properties of CA/PVP solutions indicated that the addition of appropriate PVP improved the electrospinnability of original CA solutions. Detections on the physical states of IBU in medicated CA/PVP nanofibers suggested that IBU was uniformly distributed in nanofibers in an amorphous state. Comparing to IBU-loaded casting membrane, the medicated CA/PVP nanofibers provided a faster IBU diffusion manner and a better ex vitro skin permeation profile due to their high superficial areas and the amorphous IBU. Furthermore, CA/PVP nanofibers exhibited a high water vapor permeability, which could render an improved breathability to transdermal patches. In sum, the electrospun drug-loaded CA/PVP nanofibers exhibited great potentials to improve the thermodynamic stability and breathability of transdermal patches, which could be used to develop new types of transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS).",2013,,"Shi Y, Wei Z, Zhao H, Liu T, Dong A, Zhang J.",https://doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2013.7157,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Saturation kinetics, Na(+)-activation kinetics, and inhibition by ibuprofen were analyzed by monitoring OTC-induced currents as a measure of transport activity. Oxidative stress was induced in ARPE-19 cells and primary RPE cells isolated from wild type and Slc5a8(-/-) mouse retinas using H(2)O(2), and the effects of OTC on cell death and intracellular glutathione concentration were examined.<h4>Results</h4>Heterologous expression of human SLC5A8 in X. laevis oocytes induced Na(+)-dependent inward currents in the presence of OTC under voltage-clamp conditions. The transport of OTC via SLC5A8 was saturable, with a K(t) of 104 ± 3 μM. The Na(+)-activation kinetics was sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 ± 0.1, suggesting involvement of two Na(+) in the activation process. Ibuprofen, a blocker of SLC5A8, inhibited SLC5A8-mediated OTC transport; the concentration necessary for half-maximal inhibition was 17 ± 1 μM. OTC increased glutathione levels and protected ARPE-19 and primary RPE cells isolated from wild type mouse retinas from H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. These effects were abolished in primary RPE isolated from Slc5a8(-/-) mouse retinas.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OTC is a transportable substrate for SLC5A8.

However, neither postictal changes to microvasculature nor Ca2+ changes in key cell types controlling blood perfusion have been visualized in vivo, leaving essential components of the underlying cellular mechanisms unclear. Here, we use 2-photon microvascular and Ca2+ imaging in awake mice to show that seizures result in a robust vasoconstriction of cortical penetrating arterioles, which temporally mirrors the prolonged postictal hypoxia. The vascular effect was dependent on cyclooxygenase 2, as pretreatment with ibuprofen prevented postictal vasoconstriction. Moreover, seizures caused a rapid elevation in astrocyte endfoot Ca2+ that was confined to the seizure period, and vascular smooth muscle cells displayed a significant increase in Ca2+ both during and following seizures, lasting up to 75 minutes. Our data show enduring postictal vasoconstriction and temporal activities of 2 cell types within the neurovascular unit that are associated with seizure-induced hypoperfusion/hypoxia.

Weaning-induced breast involution is implicated, as the collagen-rich, immunosuppressive microenvironment of the involuting mammary gland is tumor promotional in mice. To investigate the role of mammary fibroblasts, isolated mammary PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells from nulliparous and postweaning mice were assessed for activation phenotype and protumorigenic function. Fibroblast activation during involution was evident by increased expression of fibrillar collagens, lysyl oxidase, <i>Tgfb1</i>, and <i>Cxcl12</i> genes. The ability of mammary tumors to grow in an isogenic, orthotopic transplant model was increased when tumor cells were coinjected with involution-derived compared with nulliparous-derived mammary fibroblasts.

MED,219025,219025,10.1172/jci109241,Effects of osmolality and oxygen availability on soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity of rat renal inner medulla.,"The renal inner medulla is ordinarily exposed to osmolalities that are much higher and to O2 tensions that are lower than those in other tissues. The effects of media osmolality and O2 availability on basal and arginine vasopressin(AVP)-responsive soluble cyclic (c)AMP-dependent protein kinase activity were examined in slices of rat inner medulla. Increasing total media osmolality from 305 to 750 or 1,650 mosM by addition of urea plas NaCl to standard Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer significantly reduced basal cAMP content and protein kinase activity ratios. This occurred in the presence or absence of O2. Incubation of slices in high osmolality buffer also blunted increases in inner medullary slice cAMP and protein kinase activity ratios induced by O2. These changes reflected predominantly an action of the urea rather than the NaCl content of high osmolality buffers. In contrast to effects on basal activity, high media osmolality significantly enhanced activation of inner medullary protein kinase by AVP. Conversely, increases in media O2 content suppressed AVP stimulation of enzyme activity. This inhibitory effect of O2 was best expressed at low osmolality. Naproxen and ibuprofen, inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis, reduced basal kinase activity ratios and increased AVP responsiveness in the presence, but not in the absence, of O2. Exogenous prostaglandins (PG) modestly increased (PGE2 and PGE1) or did not change (PGF2alpha) cAMP and protein kinase activity ratios in O2-deprived inner medullary slices. Protein kinase activation by PGE2 was not observed in oxygenated inner medulla with high basal activity ratios. The stimulatory effects of PGE2 and PGE1 on protein kinase activity observed in O2-deprived slices were additive with those of submaximal or maximal AVP. PGE2, PGE1, and PGF2alpha all failed to suppress AVP activation of protein kinase. Thus, enhanced endogenous PGE production may contribute to the higher basal protein kinase activity ratios induced by O2. However, the results do not support a role for PGE2, PGE1, or PGF2alpha in O2-mediated inhibition of AVP responsiveness. The present data indicate that both solute content and O2 availability can alter the expression of AVP action on cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in inner medulla. AVP activation of protein kinase is best expressed when osmolality is high and O2 availability is low, conditions that pertain in inner medulla during hydropenia.",1978,,"DeRubertis FR, Craven PA.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI109241,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A possible mechanism for their efficacy in shock states.,"Granulocyte (PMN) aggregation and embolization may underlie complement (C)-mediated organ dysfunction in such syndromes as hemodialysis neutropenia and Purtscher's ischem;c retinopathy. Because of clinical and pathologic parallels, we have further suggested a role for this phenomenon in the genesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because corticosteroids are commonly used in immune diseases, and have particularly been claimed efficacious in shock and ARDS, we tested the capability of methylprednisolone (MP), hydrocortisone (HC), and dexamethasone (DEX) to inhibit PMN aggregation. Aggregation engendered in vitro by zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) was inhibited by MP and HC at concentrations approximating plasma levels achieved with the large bolus (30 mg/kg i.v) therapy advocated in shock states; DEX was almost without effect. Using intravital fluorescence microscopy, we observed PMN aggregation and embolization in the mesenteric vessels of rats given intra-arterial infusions of ZAP; this was also prevented by pretreatment with 30 mg/kg MP. Steroid inhibition of aggregation seemed not to involve disruption of receptor function, because aggregation induced by alternative agents, n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and the ionophore A23187, was also inhibited by MP. Moreover, corticosteroid inhibition of PMN prostaglandin synthesis is also an unlikely explanation for our results, since aspirin and ibuprofen failed to block aggregation and arachidonic acid neither effected aggregation itself nor ameliorated the steroid effect. Our studies provide a plausible rationale for the empiric observation that high-dose corticosteroids may benefit patients with syndromes associated with microvascular leukostasis.",1979,,"Hammerschmidt DE, White JG, Craddock PR, Jacob HS.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI109365,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Our study was designed to investigate the potential of ibuprofen, a highly specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, to reverse the hemodynamic and acid base abnormalities of canine endotoxin shock. Mean blood pressure fell to 49.8 +/- 6.6 mm Hg in dogs given endotoxin by 5 min after injection, and remained below 83 mm Hg for the duration of the 120-min observation period. In animals given endotoxin followed by ibuprofen, a similar initial drop of systemic blood pressure was seen, but it subsequently recovered to 150.2 +/- 4.1 mm Hg by 120 min (P less than 0.001). Cardiac index increased in animals given ibuprofen (2.3 +/- 0.28 liter/m2 per min) compared with animals given endotoxin alone (1.0 +/- 0.09 liter/m2 per min) by termination of the experiment. The arterial pH dropped in endotoxin treated animals to 7.18 +/- 0.03 by 120 min. Ibuprofen prevented the acidosis, the final pH in ibuprofen and endotoxin treated animals measuring 7.36 +/- 0.01.

Effects on renal hemodynamics.,"Glomerular arachidonate cyclooxygenation by isolated rat glomeruli was assessed in vitro in antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody-induced glomerulonephritis by radioimmunoassay for prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxane. After a single intravenous injection of rabbit anti-rat GBM serum, we observed enhancement of glomerular thromboxane B2 (TxB2) synthesis as early as 2 to 3 h with smaller increments in PGF2 alpha, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthetic rates. On day 2 of the disease, the glomerular synthesis of TxB2 and, to a lesser extent, PGF2 alpha and PGE2 remained enhanced, whereas on days 8, 11, and 14, TxB2 was the only prostanoid synthesized at increased rates. Glomerular TxB2 synthesis correlated with the presacrifice 24-h protein excretion. 60 min after intravenous infusion of anti-GMB serum, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased (0.66 +/- 0.04 to 0.44 +/- 0.03 ml/min per 100 g, P less than 0.05), without a significant change in renal plasma flow (RPF): 1.97 +/- 0.23 to 1.80 +/- 0.23 ml/min per 100 g) and without a change in glomerular PG synthetic rates. At 2 h, GFR and RPF reached a nadir (0.25 +/- 0.04 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 ml/min per 100 g, respectively) coinciding with a fivefold increment in glomerular TxB2. By 3 h GFR and RPF partially recovered to 0.43 +/- 0.07 and 1.77 +/- 0.20 ml/min per 100 g, respectively, P less than 0.05, despite further increments in TxB2 synthesis. This recovery of GFR and RPF coincided with increments in vasodilatory PG, (PGE2 and PGI2). The thromboxane synthetase inhibitor OKY-1581 markedly inhibited platelet and glomerular TxB2 synthesis and preserved GFR at 1, 2, and 3 h. Another thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, UK-38485, also completely inhibited platelet and glomerular TxB2 synthesis and prevented decrements of GFR at 2 and 3 h. A cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, inhibited platelet TxB2 and PGE2 synthesis and significantly reduced glomerular PGE2 but not TxB2 synthesis. In the ibuprofen-treated rats, the partial recoveries of GFR and RPF at 3 h were attenuated. The in vitro glomerular TxB2 synthesis correlated inversely with the presacrifice GFR and filtration fraction. These observations indicate that in anti-GBM nephritis there is enhanced synthesis of TxA2 and PG in the glomerulus that mediate changes in renal hemodynamics.",1983,,"Lianos EA, Andres GA, Dunn MJ.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI111100,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

SLE patients had significantly higher urinary thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and prostaglandin (PG) E2 excretion and significantly lower 6-keto-PGF1 alpha than did healthy women. In contrast, CGD patients only differed from controls for having reduced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion. The group of SLE patients with active renal lesions differed significantly from the group with inactive lesions for having a lower creatinine clearance and urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and higher urinary TXB2. Higher urinary TXB2 excretion was associated with comparable platelet TXB2 production in whole blood, undetectable TXB2 in peripheral venous blood, and unchanged urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-TXB2. A significant inverse correlation was found between urinary TXB2 and creatinine clearance rate (CCr). In contrast, the urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha showed a significant linear correlation with both CCr and para-aminohippurate clearance rate (CPAH). In four SLE and seven CGD patients, inhibition of renal cyclooxygenase activity by ibuprofen was associated with a significant reduction in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 and in both CCr and CPAH. However, the average decrease in both clearances was 50% lower in SLE patients than in CGD patients, when fractionated by the reduction in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or PGE2 excretion.

MED,3455932,3455932,10.1172/jci112284,Increased renal thromboxane production in murine lupus nephritis.,"To determine whether the amount of cyclooxygenase metabolites correlates with the development of lupus nephritis, intrarenal eicosanoid production was measured in autoimmune mice. Disease progression was related to the renal biosynthesis of prostaglandin (PGE2), prostacyclin (6 keto PGF1 alpha), and thromboxane (TXB2) using the MRL-lpr and NZB X NZW F1 hybrid mouse strains with predictably progressive forms of renal disease that mimic the human illness. Mice were evaluated for renal disease by measuring urinary protein excretion and renal immunopathological conditions and these features were related to renal eicosanoid production. These studies show that: (a) intrarenal synthesis of TXB2 increased incrementally in MRL-lpr and NZB X NZW F1 hybrid mice as renal function deteriorated and renal pathologic events progressed; (b) there were no consistent increases in the levels of two other cyclooxygenase metabolites, PGE2 or 6 keto PGF1 alpha; (c) increased TXB2 production occurred in the renal medulla, cortex, and within enriched preparations of cortical glomeruli; (d) when renal disease was prevented by pharmacologic doses of PGE2, intrarenal TXB2 did not increase; (e) administration of a dose of ibuprofen (9 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor capable of reducing 90% of platelet TXB2 without affecting intrarenal levels, did not retard the progression of renal damage. Taken together, these data indicate that the intrarenal level of TXB2 rises in relation to the severity of murine lupus nephritis. Furthermore, because of the potential deleterious effects of TXA2, enhanced production of this eicosanoid may be an important mediator of renal injury.",1986,,"Kelley VE, Sneve S, Musinski S.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI112284,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,3514678,3514678,10.1172/jci112431,Evidence that prostacyclin modulates the vascular actions of calcium in man.,"Increases in extracellular calcium (Ca++) can alter vascular tone, and thus may result in increased blood pressure (Bp) and reduced renal blood flow (RBF). Ca++ can stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and/or prostacyclin (PGI2) release in vitro, which may modulate Ca++ vascular effects. However, in man, the effect of Ca++ on PG release is not known. To study this, 14 volunteers received low-dose (2 mg/kg Ca++ gluconate) or high-dose (8 mg/kg) Ca++ infusions. The low-dose Ca++ infusion did not alter systemic or renal hemodynamics, but selectively stimulated PGI2, as reflected by the stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in urine (159 +/- 21-244 +/- 30 ng/g creatinine, P less than 0.02). The same Ca++ infusion given during cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin or ibuprofen was not associated with a rise in PGI2 and produced a rise in Bp and fall in RBF. However, sulindac, reported to be a weaker renal PG inhibitor, did not prevent the Ca++ -induced PGI2 stimulation (129 +/- 33-283 +/- 90, P less than 0.02), and RBF was maintained despite similar increases in Bp. The high-dose Ca++ infusion produced an increase in mean Bp without a change in cardiac output, and stimulated urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha to values greater than that produced by the 2-mg/kg Ca++ dose (330 +/- 45 vs. 244 +/- 30, P less than 0.05). In contrast, urinary PGE2 levels did not change. A Ca++ blocker, nifedipine, alone had no effect on Bp or urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels, but completely prevented the Ca++ -induced rise in Bp and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion (158 +/- 30 vs. 182 +/- 38, P greater than 0.2). However, the rise in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was not altered by the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin (159 +/- 21-258 +/- 23, P less than 0.02), suggesting that calcium entry and not alpha 1 receptor activation mediates Ca++ pressor and PGI2 stimulatory effects.

MED,3108321,3108321,10.1172/jci113020,Aspirin prolongs bleeding time in uremia by a mechanism distinct from platelet cyclooxygenase inhibition.,"We reported that aspirin (ASA) abnormally prolongs bleeding time (BT) in uremia. The present study was designed to investigate whether the abnormally prolonged post-ASA BT in uremia is due to different ASA pharmacokinetics and bioavailability that might be a consequence of uremic condition, platelet cyclooxygenase is peculiarly sensitive to ASA in uremia, and ASA affects primary hemostasis in uremia by a mechanism independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. Our results showed that in patients with uremia, but not in normal subjects, ASA markedly prolongs the BT. This effect is transient and depends on the presence of ASA in the blood. The observed differences in ASA kinetic parameters are not an explanation of the exaggerated effect of ASA on primary hemostasis in uremia. The sensitivity of platelet cyclooxygenase to ASA inhibition is comparable in uremics and in normal subjects. The temporal dissociation between ASA-induced prolongation of BT and the effect on platelet thromboxane A2 generation suggests that ASA inhibits platelet function in uremia by a mechanism distinct from cyclooxygenase blocking. This possibility is strengthened by the observation that ibuprofen at a dose that fully inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase activity does not significantly prolong BT.",1987,,"Gaspari F, Viganò G, Orisio S, Bonati M, Livio M, Remuzzi G.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/113020/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Synergism with tumor necrosis factor and the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition.,"In addition to activating T and B lymphocytes, interleukin 1 (IL-1) induces several hematologic and metabolic changes typical of host responses to infection and injury. We now report a new biological property, namely, the induction of hypotension. Rabbits given a single intravenous injection of recombinant human IL-1-beta (5 micrograms/kg) rapidly developed decreased systemic arterial pressure, which reached the lowest levels after 50-60 min and slowly returned to pre-IL-1 values after 3 h. Associated with the hypotension, systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure fell, while cardiac output and heart rate increased. These responses were prevented by ibuprofen given 15 min before the IL-1. A bolus injection of IL-1 followed by a 2-h infusion sustained the hypotension and was associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Ibuprofen given at the mid-point of the infusion reversed the changes in all hemodynamic parameters, but had no effect on the leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) also induced a shock-like state in rabbits. When the dose of IL-1 or TNF was reduced to 1 microgram/kg, no hemodynamic changes were observed; however, the combination of these low doses of both cytokines resulted in a profound shock-like state including histological evidence of severe pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Pretreatment with ibuprofen prevented the hemodynamic, leukocyte, and platelet changes induced by the low-dose cytokine combination, and ameliorated the pulmonary tissue damage. These results demonstrate that IL-1, like TNF, possesses the ability to induce hemodynamic and hematological changes typical of septic shock, and that the combination of IL-1 and TNF is more potent than either agent alone. These effects seem to require cyclooxygenase products, and suggest that intravenous cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be of therapeutic value in patients with IL-1/TNF-mediated shock.",1988,,"Okusawa S, Gelfand JA, Ikejima T, Connolly RJ, Dinarello CA.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI113431,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Studies were performed in rats 14 d after injection of rabbit serum (n = 6), NTS in the absence (n = 6), or presence, of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (n = 6) or a thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor antagonist, L-670,596 (n = 5). A mesangial macrophage/monocyte infiltrate was noted with equal intensity in all NTS-treated rats. Glomerular generation rates of prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2a, and TxA2 in nephritic kidneys were dramatically increased as compared to controls. 2 wk after NTS, there was an increase in glomerular plasma flow rate (SNPF), attainment of filtration pressure disequilibrium, and augmentation of net transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (delta P). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), however, was reduced, due to a marked fall in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf). Cyclooxygenase inhibition resulted in normalization of glomerular eicosanoid generation rates, amelioration of proteinuria, afferent vasoconstriction, and normalization of SNPF, delta P, Kf, and GFR. Selective antagonism of TxA2 also led to preservation of Kf, but was without effect on SNPF, thereby leading to elevated values for GFR. Thus, in contrast to the pathophysiologic role of arachidonate-lipoxygenase products in the early heterologous phase, PG-mediated vasodilatation and TxA2-induced reductions in Kf and GFR underlie glomerular functional changes during autologous mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.",1990,,"Takahashi K, Schreiner GF, Yamashita K, Christman BW, Blair I, Badr KF.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/114661/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Phosgene caused no increase in lung generation of cyclooxygenase metabolites and no elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure, but markedly increased transvascular fluid flux (delta W = 31 +/- 5 phosgene vs. 8 +/- 1 g unexposed, P less than 0.001), permeability to albumin (125I-HSA) lung leak index 0.274 +/- 0.035 phosgene vs. 0.019 +/- 0.001 unexposed, P less than 0.01; 125I-HSA lavage leak index 0.352 +/- 0.073 phosgene vs. 0.008 +/- 0.001 unexposed, P less than 0.01), and lung malondialdehyde (50 +/- 7 phosgene vs. 24 +/- 0.7 mumol/g dry lung unexposed, P less than 0.01).

Because iron-treated ibuprofen failed to protect, we studied the effect of ibuprofen in several iron-mediated reactions in vitro. Ibuprofen attenuated generation of .OH by a Fenton reaction and peroxidation of arachidonic acid by FeCl3 and ascorbate.

Inhibition of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun kinase and upregulation of endothelin B receptors.,"During chronic liver diseases, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) acquire an activated myofibroblast-like phenotype, proliferate, and synthetize fibrosis components. We have shown that endothelin-1 (ET-1) inhibits the proliferation of activated human HSC via endothelin B (ETB) receptors. We now investigate the transduction pathway involved in the growth inhibitory effect of ET-1 in activated HSC. Endothelin-1 and the ETB receptor agonist, sarafotoxin-S6C, increased synthesis of PGI2 and PGE2, leading to elevation of cAMP. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 both blunted the growth inhibitory effect of ET-1. Analysis of early steps associated with growth inhibition indicated that: (a) similar to ET-1, forskolin decreased c-jun mRNA induction without affecting c-fos and krox 24 mRNA expression; (b) ET-1, sarafotoxin-S6C, as well as forskolin, reduced activation of both c-Jun kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Finally, forskolin, PGI2, and PGE2 raised by fivefold the number of ET binding sites after 6 h, and increased the proportion of ETB receptors from 50% in control cells to 80% in treated cells. In conclusion, ET-1 inhibits proliferation of activated HSC via ETB receptors, through a prostaglandin/cAMP pathway that leads to inhibition of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun kinase activities. Upregulation of ETB receptors by prostaglandin/cAMP raises the possibility of a positive feedback loop that would amplify the growth inhibitory response. These results suggest that ET-1 and agents that increase cAMP might be of interest to limit proliferation of activated HSC during chronic liver diseases.",1996,,"Mallat A, Préaux AM, Serradeil-Le Gal C, Raufaste D, Gallois C, Brenner DA, Bradham C, Maclouf J, Iourgenko V, Fouassier L, Dhumeaux D, Mavier P, Lotersztajn S.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI119103,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study, 20 commonly used NSAIDs, dapsone, and enantiomers of flurbiprofen were analyzed for their ability to lower the level of the 42-amino-acid form of amyloid beta protein (Abeta42) in a human H4 cell line. Thirteen of the NSAIDs and the enantiomers of flurbiprofen were then tested in acute dosing studies in amyloid beta protein precursor (APP) transgenic mice, and plasma and brain levels of Abeta and the drug were evaluated. These studies show that (a). eight FDA-approved NSAIDs lower Abeta42 in vivo, (b). the ability of an NSAID to lower Abeta42 levels in cell culture is highly predicative of its in vivo activity, (c). in vivo Abeta42 lowering in mice occurs at drug levels achievable in humans, and (d). there is a significant correlation between Abeta42 lowering and levels of ibuprofen. Importantly, flurbiprofen and its enantiomers selectively lower Abeta42 levels in broken cell gamma-secretase assays, indicating that these compounds directly target the gamma-secretase complex that generates Abeta from APP. Of the compounds tested, meclofenamic acid, racemic flurbiprofen, and the purified R and S enantiomers of flurbiprofen lowered Abeta42 levels to the greatest extent. Because R-flurbiprofen reduces Abeta42 levels by targeting gamma-secretase and has reduced side effects related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), it is an excellent candidate for clinical testing as an Abeta42 lowering agent.",2003,,"Eriksen JL, Sagi SA, Smith TE, Weggen S, Das P, McLendon DC, Ozols VV, Jessing KW, Zavitz KH, Koo EH, Golde TE.",https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI200318162,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,9710435,9710435,10.1172/jci2614,Ibuprofen inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl- secretion.,"We evaluated the acute effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion (Isc) in both colonic and airway epithelia. In T84 cells, ibuprofen inhibited the forskolin-dependent Isc in a concentration-dependent manner, having an apparent Ki of 142 microM. Salicylic acid inhibited Isc with an apparent Ki of 646 microM. We determined whether ibuprofen would also inhibit the forskolin-stimulated Isc in primary cultures of mouse trachea epithelia (MTE) and human bronchial epithelia (HBE). Similar to our results in T84 cells, ibuprofen (500 microM) inhibited the forskolin-induced Isc in MTEs and HBEs by 59+/-4% (n = 11) and 39+/-6% (n = 8), respectively. Nystatin was employed to selectively permeabilize the basolateral or apical membrane to determine the effect of ibuprofen on apical Cl- (ICl) and basolateral K+ (IK) currents after stimulation by forskolin. After forskolin stimulation, ibuprofen (500 microM) reduced both the ICl and IK; reducing ICl and IK by 60 and 15%, respectively. To determine whether this inhibition of ICl was due to the inhibition of CFTR, the effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on CFTR Cl- channels in excised, inside-out patches from L-cells were evaluated. Ibuprofen (300 microM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 60+/-16% and this was explained by a short-lived block (approximately 1.2 ms) which causes an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.07+/-0.04 pA to 0.59+/-0.04 pA (n = 3). Similarly, salicylic acid (3 mM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 50+/-8% with an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.08+/-0.03 pA to 0.48+/-0.06 pA (n = 4). Based on these results, we conclude that the NSAIDs ibuprofen and salicylic acid inhibit cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion in human colonic and airway epithelia via a direct inhibition of CFTR Cl- channels as well as basolateral membrane K+ channels. This may reduce their efficacy in conjunction with other therapeutic strategies designed to increase CFTR expression and/or function in secretory epithelia.",1998,,"Devor DC, Schultz BD.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/2614/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

LPS caused also dose-dependent elevations in urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor 6-keto PGF(1alpha) (PGI-M) and 11-dehydro thromboxane B(2) (Tx-M). Platelet COX-1 inhibition by chronic administration of low-dose aspirin before LPS did not alter the symptomatic and febrile responses to LPS, but the increment in urinary PGI-M and Tx-M were both partially depressed. Pretreatment with ibuprofen, a nonspecific COX inhibitor, attenuated the febrile and systemic response to LPS and inhibited prostanoid biosynthesis. Both celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and ibuprofen attenuated the pyrexial, but not the chronotropic, response to LPS. Experimental endotoxemia caused differential expression of the COX isozymes in monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes ex vivo. LPS also increased urinary iPF(2alpha)-III, iPF(2alpha)-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF(2alpha)-VI, isoprostane (iP) indices of lipid peroxidation, and none of the drugs blunted this response. These studies indicate that (a) although COX-2 predominates, both COX isozymes are induced and contribute to the prostaglandin response to LPS in humans; (b) COX activation contributes undetectably to lipid peroxidation induced by LPS; and (c) COX-2, but not COX-1, contributes to the constitutional response to LPS in humans.",2000,,"McAdam BF, Mardini IA, Habib A, Burke A, Lawson JA, Kapoor S, FitzGerald GA.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/9523/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study aimed to develop nasal sprays using commonly available over-the-counter analgesics, providing an alternative treatment option that is more convenient and potentially more effective in managing pain, particularly in pediatric patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Three different nasal spray formulations with the contents of diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, and paracetamol were created, and characterization studies were completed. The possible cytotoxic, genotoxic, and apoptotic effects of nasal sprays were studied on human normal skin fibroblastic cells (CCD-1079Sk) using WST cell viability test, alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis analysis, and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>The formulations' physical appearance and drug content were assessed, yielding nonsignificant results (<i>p</i> > 0.05). All formulations were determined at pH 5.5-6.2 so that the pH values of the prepared formulations were compatible with the pH value of the nasal mucosa.

This study examines the use of a hair follicle closure technique in vitro, to determine the participation of hair follicles in transdermal drug penetration. Various substances, with different lipophilicities, were tested: caffeine, diclofenac, flufenamic acid, ibuprofen, paracetamol, salicylic acid and testosterone. Diffusion experiments were conducted with porcine skin, the most common replacement material for human skin, in Franz-type diffusion cells over 28 hours. Different experimental settings allowed the differentiation between interfollicular and follicular permeation after topical application of the test compounds. A comparison of the apparent permeability coefficients of the drugs demonstrates that the percutaneous permeations of caffeine and flufenamic acid were significantly higher along the hair follicles. In the cases of paracetamol and testosterone, the follicular pathway appears to be of importance, while no difference was found between interfollicular and follicular permeation for diclofenac, ibuprofen and salicylic acid.

Depending on the formulation, noticeable differences in the permeation of Ibuprofen occurred in vitro (udder skin) and ex vivo (isolated perfused bovine udder), but not in the cellophane membrane. The rates of ibuprofen permeability (cream > gel > microgel) and adsorption into the skin (gel > microgel > cream) varied with the formulation, and were probably caused by differences in the ingredients. Furthermore, different storage conditions and seasonal variation in the collection of the skin samples probably led to differences in the amounts of ibuprofen adsorption apparent in the isolated bovine udder and udder skin.

Current treatment focuses predominantly on restricting dietary consumption of lactose. Given lactose is one of the most commonly used excipients in the pharmaceutical industry, consideration must be given to the lactose content and therefore safety of pharmaceutical preparations prescribed for patients with lactose intolerance. This article summarizes the current literature examining the likelihood of inducing adverse effects through the administration of lactose-containing pharmaceutical preparations in patients reporting lactose intolerance, describes how to assess this risk on an individual patient basis and reviews suitable analgesic options for this population. A case study is presented detailing a patient reporting lactose intolerance who insists on treatment with the lactose-free product codeine/ibuprofen (Nurofen Plus) rather than other codeine-free analgesics. It is important to assess the likelihood of lactose as an excipient inducing symptoms in this scenario, as reluctance to cease codeine could suggest codeine dependence, an issue that is becoming increasingly common in countries such as Australia and Canada. Given codeine dependence is associated with serious sequelae including hospitalization and death, the patient must either be reassured the lactose component in their prescribed analgesics will not induce symptoms or an alternative treatment strategy must be confirmed. General recommendations applying theory from the literature to the management of acute pain in lactose-intolerant patients are discussed and specific treatment options are outlined. Although large inter-individual variability is reported, most lactose-intolerant patients can tolerate the small quantities of lactose found in pharmaceutical preparations. Cumulative lactose exposure can be assessed in patients taking multiple medications while also consuming lactose in the diet. In those sensitive to small quantities of lactose, lactase supplements can be trailed.

Thus, the aim of this study was to know the drug therapies including natural products and homeopathic drugs offered by Colombian pharmaceutical establishments for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, as well as the information provided on the safe use of the product.<h4>Methods</h4>An observational, cross-sectional mystery shopping study was carried out to determine the pharmaceutical alternatives for the management of COVID-19 offered by pharmaceutical establishments (drugstores, pharmacies, homeopathic pharmacies, and nutritional supplements stores) in Colombia, and information related to the safe use of the product. The study included 482 pharmaceutical establishments from 16 Colombian departments. Data collection was done through telephone calls to each of the establishments following an interview protocol pretending to be a patient who presents symptoms related to COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>About 57.3% (276) of the establishments recommended a product for the treatment of COVID-19 infection, 66.6% (321) asked whether the caller had COVID-19 symptoms and what they are, and 44.2% (213) suggested taking a COVID-19 test. Of 59 drugs suggested by pharmacies, the most recommended were azithromycin, ivermectin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and ASA (aspirin). From the establishments that recommended a product, dosage was indicated in 85.5% (236) of the pharmaceutical establishments and 14.5% (40) of the establishments reported the most common adverse effects of this substance. About 9.4% (26) of the establishments reported possible interactions of the recommended drugs and substances with food, beverages, or supplements.<b>Conclusion:</b> Pharmaceutical establishments in Colombia seem to have significantly contributed to self-medication for COVID-19 in Colombia during the pandemic.

The study included 482 pharmaceutical establishments from 16 Colombian departments. <b>Results:</b> Of 59 drugs suggested by pharmacies, the most recommended were azithromycin, ivermectin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. The recommended dose was indicated in 85.5% (236) of the pharmaceutical establishments, and 14.5% (40) of them reported the most common adverse effects of the recommended product. About 9.4% (26) of the establishments reported possible interactions of the recommended drugs and substances with food, beverages, or supplements. <b>Conclusion:</b> The majority of the pharmaceutical establishments included in the study promoted inadequate self-medication for COVID-19 in Colombia during the pandemic.",2022,,"Nino-Orrego MJ, Baracaldo-Santamaría D, Patricia Ortiz C, Zuluaga HP, Cruz-Becerra SA, Soler F, Pérez-Acosta AM, Delgado DR, Calderon-Ospina CA.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20420986221101964,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen (IBF) is known to be used to treat inflammatory diseases, but when administered orally, high concentrations can cause some adverse problems. In this work, the incorporation of IBF in the NRL membranes was evaluated by physical-chemical, <i>in vitro</i> permeation, hemocompatibility and molecular modeling assays. In addition, the <i>in vitro</i> release profile of IBF in acid and basic media was analyzed during 96 h. The IBF-NRL membrane exhibited the absence of intermolecular bonding that could hinder drug release and presented compatible mechanical properties for applications as a cutaneous adhesive (0.58 and 1.12 MPa to Young's modulus and rupture tension, respectively). The IBF-NRL system did not present a significant hemolysis degree (1.67%) within 24 h. The release test indicated that in the first hours of the study, 48.5% IBF was released at basic pH and 22.5% at acidic pH, which is characteristic of a burst effect. Then, a stable release profile was observed until the end of the assay, with total IBF release of 60% in alkaline medium and 50% in acidic medium. The drug permeation results indicated that the IBF-NRL membranes can be used for the local skin treatment with permeation of 3.11% of IBF. Dynamic Molecular simulations indicated a pronounced electric dipole in the ionized form of IBF, which suggests a more effective interaction with water, explaining the efficient drug release in alkaline solutions.

Ciprofloxacin is a widely used fluoroquinolone in various disease conditions. Resistance against ciprofloxacin is increasing, leading to nonoptimal management of patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess ciprofloxacin use in the community setting in terms of appropriate prescribing, dosing, frequency, and duration of use. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional, retrospective study was conducted by community pharmacists in 5 community pharmacies in Egypt from September 2021 to February 2022. Patients prescribed oral ciprofloxacin during the period of the study were included. Data on demographics, indications for ciprofloxacin, dosing regimen, adverse events, and drug interactions were collected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 151 patients' record indicated for ciprofloxacin were included in the study, of whom 44.4% were men and 55.6% were women who were neither pregnant nor lactating.

Possible candidates for transport proteins mediating accumulation of these mediators in granules include multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4, ABCC4), a transport pump for cyclic nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. We investigated the expression of MRP4 in human platelets by immunoblotting, detecting a strong signal at 170 kDa. Immunofluorescence microscopy using 2 MRP4-specific antibodies revealed staining mainly in intracellular structures, which largely colocalized with the accumulation of mepacrine as marker for delta-granules and to a lower extent at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, an altered distribution of MRP4 was observed in platelets from a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome with defective delta-granules. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) transport codistributed with MRP4 detection in subcellular fractions, with highest activities in the dense granule and plasma membrane fractions. This transport was inhibited by dipyramidole, indomethacin, and MK571 with median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 12, 22, and 43 microM, and by ibuprofen. Transport studies with [(3)H]ADP indicated the presence of an orthovanadate-sensitive ADP transporting system, inhibited by dipyramidole, MK571, and cyclic nucleotides.

Previously we have demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages infiltrating the onplants were associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, in particular by delivering MMP-13 collagenase. By introducing chicken gelatinase B (chMMP-9) as a specific marker for heterophils, we now show that the onset and extent of angiogenesis induced by purified growth factors or by human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells correlated with the initial influx of chMMP-9-positive heterophils. This early heterophil arrival was followed by the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and appeared to sustain further blood vessel formation. The disruption of inflammatory cell influx by 2 mechanistically distinct anti-inflammatory drugs, cortisone and ibuprofen, significantly inhibited angiogenesis, indicating a functional involvement of these inflammatory cells in new blood vessel development. A direct addition of isolated heterophils or purified chMMP-9 into the HT-1080 onplants engrafted into cortisone- or ibuprofen-treated embryos reversed the antiangiogenic effects of the drugs. The exogenously added heterophils induced in vivo a further infiltration of endogenous heterophils and monocytes and dramatically rescued the impaired angiogenesis, highlighting the importance of early inflammatory leukocytes in tumor-induced angiogenesis. Moreover, purified heterophils incorporated into onplants lacking growth factors or tumor cells induced angiogenesis in nontreated embryos, further indicating a direct proangiogenic role for neutrophil-like leukocytes.",2006,,"Zijlstra A, Seandel M, Kupriyanova TA, Partridge JJ, Madsen MA, Hahn-Dantona EA, Quigley JP, Deryugina EI.",https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2005-04-1458,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A systematic literature review found evidence to support efficacy in treating patients with OA for all agents except oxycodone/ibuprofen, which has not been studied in this patient population, although ibuprofen and immediate-release oxycodone have been studied individually for OA pain. Evidence quality was inconsistent, with several agents lacking long-term, controlled trials against active comparators, and functional end points inconsistently met. Although low-dose meloxicam and naproxen plus lansoprazole offer a reduced risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events, cardiovascular and renal risks remain similar to traditional oral NSAID therapy. Further, only lower doses of meloxicam appear to carry a reduced risk of GI events. Diclofenac patch, gel, and solution preparations offer the potential for reduced GI, cardiovascular, and renal adverse events. The level of evidence available to support the efficacy and safety of these agents for long-term treatment of patients with OA differs, with some having only short-term trials, while others have longer-duration trials with active comparators.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By expanding the treatment armamentarium, newly-approved NSAID agents may improve the ability of clinicians to tailor analgesic therapy for their diverse patient populations and to achieve realistic functional improvements.

Due to benefits like a constant plasma level, no pain during application and a simple therapeutic regime, the optimization of formulations for transdermal drug delivery has gained interest in the last decades. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound which is nowadays often used transdermally. The objective of this work was to conduct a study on the effect of different 5% ibuprofen containing formulations (Ibutop® cream, Ibutop® gel, and ibuprofen solution in phosphate buffered saline) on the in vitro-percutaneous permeation of ibuprofen through skin to emphasise the importance of the formulation on percutaneous permeation and skin reservoir.<h4>Methods</h4>The permeation experiments were conducted in Franz-type diffusion cells according to OECD guideline 428 with 2 mg/cm(2) ibuprofen formulation on each skin sample. Ibuprofen was analysed in the receptor fluid and extracted skin samples by UV-VIS high-performance liquid-chromatography at 238 nm. The plot of the cumulative amount of ibuprofen permeated versus time was employed to calculate the apparent permeability coefficient, the maximum flux and the lagtime, all of which were statistically analysed by One-way ANOVA.<h4>Results</h4>Although ibuprofen permeation out of the gel increases rapidly within the first four hours, the cream produced the highest ibuprofen delivery through the skin within 28 hours, followed by the solution and the gel. A significant shorter lagtime was found after gel treatment compared with the cream and the solution. After 28 hours 59% of the applied ibuprofen was found in the receptor fluid of the cream treated samples, 26% in the solution treated samples and 21% in the samples treated with the gel. Fourfold higher ibuprofen reservoirs were found in the solution and gel treated skin samples compared to the cream treated skin samples.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present study demonstrates the importance of the formulation on transdermal drug delivery of ibuprofen and emphasises the differences of drug storage within the skin due to the formulation.

Ibuprofen has been shown to have beneficial physiological effects when used as a treatment. However, there are conflicting results with respect to survival. This study aims to investigate the effect of ibuprofen on vital functions, various physiological parameters and survival during endotoxic shock in rabbits.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-eight New Zealand rabbits were randomly separated into four groups. The first group received only saline, the second was given 2 mg/kg intravenous endotoxin at t0, the third received 30 mg/kg ibuprofen 30 minutes after endotoxin administration, whilst the fourth group received ibuprofen 30 minutes before the endotoxin. Respiratory and heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure and rectal temperature were recorded. Complete blood counts were performed and thromboxane B2 was measured every 30 minutes for the first two hours, and then hourly over the course of the experiment. Urine samples were collected at the same time points for the measurement of prostaglandin E2.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen was found to improve respiratory rate, heart rate, and arterial pressure. However, it did not improve the negative effects of endotoxin on body temperature, haematocrit values, white blood cell count, and thrombocyte number. Thromboxane B2 levels in group IV were significantly lower than in the other groups, and the increase started at a later timepoint. In ibuprofen-treated animals, Prostaglandin E2 levels stayed low for at least 90 minutes, but started to rise thereafter. While the average survival in Group II animals was 192.9 +/- 46.9 minutes, those of groups III and IV were 339.1 +/- 33.5 minutes (p < 0.05) and 383.0 +/- 39.6 minutes (p = 0.01), respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen appears to increase survival in endotoxic shock-induced animals.

We tested the hypotheses that a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen treatment during fasting decreased renal water and sodium excretion by increased absorption of water and sodium via the aquaporin2 water channels and the epithelial sodium channels.<h4>Methods</h4>The effect of ibuprofen, 600 mg thrice daily, was measured during fasting in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study of 17 healthy humans. The subjects received a standardized diet on day 1, fasted at day 2, and received an IV infusion of 3% NaCl on day 3. The effect variables were urinary excretions of aquaporin2 (u-AQP2), the beta-fraction of the epithelial sodium channel (u-ENaCbeta), cyclic-AMP (u-cAMP), prostaglandin E2 (u-PGE2). Free water clearance (CH2O), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and plasma concentrations of vasopressin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial-, and brain natriuretic peptide.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen decreased u-AQP2, u-PGE2, and FENa at all parts of the study. During the same time, ibuprofen significantly increased u-ENaCbeta. Ibuprofen did not change the response in p-AVP, u-c-AMP, urinary output, and free water clearance during any of these periods. Atrial-and brain natriuretic peptide were higher.<h4>Conclusion</h4>During inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, urinary sodium excretion decreased in parallel with an increase in sodium absorption and increase in u-ENaCbeta. U-AQP2 decreased indicating that water transport via AQP2 fell. The vasopressin-c-AMP-axis did not mediate this effect, but it may be a consequence of the changes in the natriuretic peptide system and/or the angiotensin-aldosterone system<h4>Trial registration</h4>Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT00281762.",2010,,"Lauridsen TG, Vase H, Starklint J, Graffe CC, Bech JN, Nielsen S, Pedersen EB.",http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/11/28/abstract,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is evident that an anti-inflammatory therapy represents an important step in the treatment of CF patients. Corticosteroids and ibuprofen have been proven to slow down the impairment of the pulmonary function in CF patients but their use is limited by the frequency of adverse events. A novel strategy for delivering low doses of steroids for long periods through the infusion of autologous erythrocytes loaded with dexamethasone has been recently set up. A recent study suggested the feasibility of therapy with low doses of corticosteroids delivered through engineered erythrocytes in CF patients. This study presents a further analysis of safety and efficacy of this therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>The treatment group was not randomised and the assignment was based on the patient's consent. Patients entered the study if they had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <70%, puberty development completed, pancreatic insufficiency, and chronic pulmonary infection requiring frequent cycles of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Patients were excluded if they underwent systemic corticosteriod therapy in the three months preceding the experimental treatment or were on therapy with non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NASDs), or if they had liver CF disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or positive tuberculin test. Controls were patients who followed a standard treatment, who fulfilled the enrollment criteria, and who were matched to the experimental group by gender, age, and severity of the disease.<h4>Results</h4>Nine patients in the experimental group received the treatment once a month for a period of 24 month. Patients did not develop diabetes, cataract, or hypertension, or other typical side effects of steroid treatment during the follow up period. There was a constant improvement of FEV1 in patients undergoing the experimental treatment compared to a gradual decrease of the same parameter in the standard therapy group (P = 0.04). The average of clinic and radiological indexes did not vary. The number of infective relapses that have required antibiotic intravenous therapy was not different in the two groups, although the average of these episodes was slightly higher in the experimental therapy group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Intraerythrocyte corticosteroid treatment may stabilize the respiratory function in CF patients but is often considered too invasive by patients. The results obtained by our study may help planning an experimental, controlled, randomised study. A sample size of 150 patients per group would be sufficient for demonstrating such a difference with a 95% confidence interval and a power of 90%.",2006,,"Lucidi V, Tozzi AE, Bella S, Turchetta A.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-6-17,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Dietary lipids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a published track record of providing protection against gastrointestinal malignancies. In this regard, we examined the effects of membrane plasmalogens and ibuprofen on regulation of cellular levels of diamines, polyamine mediators that are augmented in cancer cells. For these studies we utilized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and NRel-4 cells, a CHO cell line with defective plasmalogen synthesis.<h4>Results</h4>NRel-4 cells, which possess cellular plasmalogen levels that are 10% of control CHO cells, demonstrated 2- to 3-fold increases in cellular diamine levels. These diamine levels were normalized by plasmalogen replacement and significantly reduced by ibuprofen. In both cases the mechanism of action appears to mainly involve increased diamine efflux via the diamine exporter. The actions of ibuprofen were not stereospecific, supporting previous studies that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition is unlikely to be involved in the ability of NSAIDs to reduce intracellular diamine levels.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data demonstrate that ibuprofen, a drug known to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, reduces cellular diamine levels via augmentation of diamine efflux. Similarly, augmentation of membrane plasmalogens can increase diamine export from control and plasmalogen-deficient cells. These data support the concept that membrane transporter function may be a therapeutic point of intervention for dietary and pharmacological approaches to cancer chemoprevention.",2011,,"Wood PL, Khan MA, Smith T, Goodenowe DB.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-511X-10-214,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However in gliomas the role of this prostanoid is poorly understood. Here, we report on the proliferative, migratory, and apoptotic effects of PGE(1), PGE(2) and Ibuprofen (IBP) observed in the T98G human glioma cell line in vitro.<h4>Methods</h4>T98G human glioma cells were treated with IBP, PGE(1) or PGE(2) at varying concentrations for 24-72 hours. Cell proliferation, mitotic index and apoptotic index were determined for each treatment. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity was measured using fluorescent probes in live cells (FITC-LEHD-FMK and FITC-DEVD-FMK respectively). The migratory capacity of the cells was quantified using a scratch migration assay and a transwell migration assay.<h4>Results</h4>A significant decrease was seen in cell number (54%) in the presence of 50 μM IBP. Mitotic index and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation were also decreased 57% and 65%, respectively, by IBP. The apoptotic index was increased (167%) and the in situ activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was evident in IBP treated cells. The inhibition of COX activity by IBP also caused a significant inhibition of cell migration in the monolayer scratch assay (74%) and the transwell migration assay (36%). In contrast, the presence of exogenous PGE(1) or PGE(2) caused significant increases in cell number (37% PGE(1) and 45% PGE(2)). When mitotic index was measured no change was found for either PG treatment. However, the BrdU incorporation rate was significantly increased by PGE(1) (62%) and to a greater extent by PGE(2) (100%). The apoptotic index was unchanged by exogenous PGs. The addition of exogenous PGs caused an increase in cell migration in the monolayer scratch assay (43% PGE(1) and 44% PGE(2)) and the transwell migration assay (28% PGE(1) and 68% PGE(2)).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study demonstrated that treatments which alter PGE(1) and PGE(2) metabolism influence the proliferative and apoptotic indices of T98G glioma cells. The migratory capacity of the cells was also significantly affected by the change in prostaglandin metabolism.

The relationship between inflammation and cell proliferation due to chronic infection has been studied, but the mechanism is not fully clear. Though the mode of cadmium toxicity is well characterized in animal cells, still it requires some further investigations. Previously we reported that cadmium induces immune cell death in Swiss albino mice. In the present study we showed that instead of inducing cell death mechanism, cadmium in low concentration triggers proliferation in mice lung cell and our results reveals that prior to the induction of proliferation it causes severe inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>Swiss albino mice were treated with different concentrations of cadmium to determine the LD50. Mice were subdivided (5 mice each) according to the exposure period (15, 30, 45, 60 days) and were given sub lethal dose (5 mg/Kg body weight) of cadmium chloride and ibuprofen (50 mg/Kg body weight, recommended dose) once in a week. SEM and histology were performed as evidence of changes in cellular morphology. Inflammation was measured by the expression of Cox-2 and MMPs. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Cox-2, IL-6), signaling and cell cycle regulatory molecules (STAT3, Akt, CyclinD1) were measured by western blot, ELISA and immunoprecipitation. Mutagenecity was evidenced by comet assay. Cell proliferation was determined by cell count, cell cycle and DNA analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Prolonged exposure of low concentration of cadmium resulted in up regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and cell cycle regulatory molecules. Though NSAIDs like Ibuprofen reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, but it did not show any inhibitory effect on cadmium adopted lung cell proliferation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results prove that cadmium causes both inflammation and cell proliferation when applied in a low dose but proliferative changes occur independent of inflammation.",2009,,"Kundu S, Sengupta S, Chatterjee S, Mitra S, Bhattacharyya A.",http://www.biomedcentral.com/1476-9255/6/19,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Total expenditure on NSAIDs has risen by 57% over five years, to 247 pounds sterling million in 2004. We assess whether this expenditure increase can be accounted for by substitution--an increased prescribing of two (more expensive) selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib) and a simultaneous equivalent reduction in the prescribing volume of three (cheaper) older NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen).<h4>Methods</h4>Quarterly prescription data was collated from January 1999 to September 2004. Over this period, the level of correlation between the total prescribing volumes for i) celecoxib and rofecoxib, and ii) diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen were compared, the change in total expenditure on the five NSAIDs was also estimated. The latter was apportioned into that which was estimated to have arisen due to i) substitution, and ii) increased NSAID prescription volume.<h4>Results</h4>Total prescription volumes for the two NSAID groups were negatively correlated (r = -0.97, p < 0.001). In the last quarter there were 1.23 million prescriptions for celecoxib and rofecoxib, and 0.46 million fewer prescriptions for naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen (than in the first quarter, when celecoxib and rofecoxib were not prescribed). Total expenditure for the five NSAIDs was 32.7 pounds sterling million higher in the last quarter, than the first, 12.2 pounds sterling million of which was estimated to be due to substitution, and 20.4 pounds sterling million due to increased volume.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The introduction of celecoxib and rofecoxib was associated with a reduction in the prescription volume for naproxen, diclofenac, and ibuprofen. However, overall quarterly prescription volume for these five NSAIDs increased by 0.76 million, and we estimate that quarterly expenditure increased by 20.4 pounds sterling million more than would have been expected if overall NSAID volume had remained constant. This suggests that the prescription of both celecoxib and rofecoxib may have 'leaked' to population groups who would not previously have received an older NSAID.",2006,,"Barton GR, Avery AJ, Whynes DK.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-7547-4-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pediatricians, prescribing antipyretics for children, rarely encounter significant problems, but the few epidemiologic studies performed show conflicting results. Although it is clear that some patients with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-sensitive asthma have their clinical onset of disease in childhood and bronchoconstriction after ASA challenge is seen in 0 to 22% of asthmatic children so challenged, ibuprofen at antipyretic doses may cause acute respiratory problems only in a very small number of mild to moderate asthmatics. The recently elucidated mechanism of action of acetaminophen may explain some occurrences of adverse reactions in patients with cross-reactive NSAID hypersensitivity on the basis of its inhibitory activity on the newly described enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX)-3. This nonspecific sensitivity to inhibition of COX is most likely genetically determined and shows a remarkable association with atopic disease even in the very young age group and possibly an increased predilection in specific ethnic groups.

Since these phenomena partially mimic the cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) concomitant to Alzheimer's disease, the findings in TGF-beta1 over-expressing mice prompted the hypothesis that CAA could be caused or enhanced by the abnormal production of TGF-beta1. This idea was in accordance with the view that chronic inflammation contributes to Alzheimer's disease, and drew attention to the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of Abeta-elicited CAA. We thus studied the effect of anti-inflammatory drug administration in TGF-beta1-induced pathology. METHODS: Two-month-old TGF-beta1 mice and littermate controls were orally administered pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist, or ibuprofen, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, for two months. Glia activation was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis; Abeta precursor protein (APP) by western blot analysis; Abeta deposition by immunohistochemistry, thioflavin-S staining and ELISA; and hydrocephalus by measurements of ventricle size on autoradiographies of brain sections. Results are expressed as means +/- SD. Data comparisons were carried with the Student's T test when two groups were compared, or ANOVA analysis when more than three groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Animals displayed glia activation, hydrocephalus and a robust thioflavin-S-positive vascular deposition. Unexpectedly, these deposits contained no Abeta or serum amyloid P component, a common constituent of amyloid deposits. The thioflavin-S-positive material thus remains to be identified. Pioglitazone decreased glia activation and basal levels of Abeta42- with no change in APP contents - while it increased hydrocephalus, and had no effect on the thioflavin-S deposits. Ibuprofen mimicked the reduction of glia activation caused by pioglitazone and the lack of effect on the thioflavin-S-labeled deposits. CONCLUSIONS: i) TGF-beta1 over-expressing mice may not be an appropriate model of Abeta-elicited CAA; and ii) pioglitazone has paradoxical effects on TGF-beta1-induced pathology suggesting that anti-inflammatory therapy may reduce the damage resulting from active glia, but not from vascular alterations or hydrocephalus.

Accumulation of cerebral vascular fibrillar Abeta is implicated in promoting local neuroinflammation, causes marked degeneration of smooth muscle cells, and can lead to loss of vessel wall integrity with hemorrhage. However, the relationship between cerebral vascular fibrillar Abeta-induced inflammatory responses and localized cytotoxicity in the vessel wall remains unclear.Steroidal-based anti-inflammatory agents, such as dexamethasone, have been reported to reduce neuroinflammation and hemorrhage associated with CAA. Nevertheless, the basis for the beneficial effects of steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment with respect to local inflammation and hemorrhage in CAA is unknown. The cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cell system is a useful in vitro model to study the pathogenic effects of Abeta in CAA. To examine the possibility that dexamethasone may influence CAA-induced cellular pathology, we investigated the effect of this anti-inflammatory agent on inflammatory and cytotoxic responses to Abeta by HCSM cells.<h4>Methods</h4>Primary cultures of HCSM cells were treated with or without pathogenic Abeta in the presence or absence of the steroidal anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin or ibuprofen. Cell viability was measured using a fluorescent live cell/dead cell assay. Quantitative immunoblotting was performed to determine the amount of cell surface Abeta and amyloid beta-protein precursor (AbetaPP) accumulation and loss of vascular smooth cell alpha actin. To assess the extent of inflammation secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured by ELISA and active matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) levels were evaluated by gelatin zymography.<h4>Results</h4>Pathogenic Abeta-induced HCSM cell death was markedly reduced by dexamethasone but was unaffected by ibuprofen or indomethacin. Dexamethasone had no effect on the initial pathogenic effects of Abeta including HCSM cell surface binding, cell surface fibril-like assembly, and accumulation of cell surface AbetaPP. However, later stage pathological consequences of Abeta treatment associated with inflammation and cell degeneration including increased levels of IL-6, activation of MMP-2, and loss of HCSM alpha actin were significantly diminished by dexamethasone but not by indomethacin or ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results suggest that although dexamethasone has no appreciable consequence on HCSM cell surface fibrillar Abeta accumulation it effectively reduces the subsequent pathologic responses including elevated levels of IL-6, MMP-2 activation, and depletion of HCSM alpha actin. Dexamethasone, unlike indomethacin or ibuprofen, may diminish these pathological processes that likely contribute to inflammation and loss of vessel wall integrity leading to hemorrhage in CAA.",2006,,"Previti ML, Zhang W, Van Nostrand WE.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-3-18,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

These side-effects complicate long term studies of neuropathy or analgesic interventions in animals. We recently demonstrated that pretreatment with sodium bicarbonate (4% NaHCO3) prior to cisplatin (3 mg/kg i.p. weekly up to 5 weeks) was associated with improved health status (i.e. normal weight gain, body temperature, creatinine and ketone levels, and kidney weight ratio) in rats (Neurosci Lett 544:41-46, 2013). To reduce the nephrotoxic effects of cisplatin treatment in mice, we compared effects of sodium bicarbonate (4% NaHCO3 s.c.), vitamin C (25 mg/kg s.c.), resveratrol (25 mg/kg s.c.) and saline (0.9% NaCl) pretreatment on cisplatin-induced changes in animal health status, neuropathic pain and proinflammatory cytokine levels in spinal cord and kidney.<h4>Results</h4>Cisplatin-treated mice receiving saline pretreatment exhibited elevated ketone, creatinine and kidney weight ratios, representative of nephrotoxicity. Vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate lowered creatinine/ketone levels and kidney weight ratio whereas resveratrol normalized creatinine levels and kidney weight ratios similar to saline pretreatment. All pretreatments were associated with decreased ketone levels compared to saline pretreatment. Cisplatin-induced neuropathy (i.e. mechanical and cold allodynia) developed equivalently in all pretreatment groups and was similarly reversed by either morphine (6 mg/kg i.p.) or ibuprofen (6 mg/kg i.p.) treatment. RT-PCR showed that mRNA levels for IL-1β were increased in lumbar spinal cord of cisplatin-treated groups pretreated with either saline, NaHCO3 or resveratrol/cisplatin-treated groups. However, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were elevated in the kidneys in all cisplatin-treated groups. Our studies also demonstrate that 60 days after the last cisplatin treatment, body weight, body temperature, kidney functions and mRNA levels have returned to baseline although the neuropathic pain (mechanical and cold) is maintained.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Studies employing cisplatin should include NaHCO3 or vitamin C pretreatment to improve animal health status and reduce nephrotoxicity (lower creatinine and kidney weight ratio) without affecting the development of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy or analgesic efficacy.",2014,,"Guindon J, Deng L, Fan B, Wager-Miller J, Hohmann AG.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-8069-10-56,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In fact, a relationship between amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and a decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of beta-catenin has been observed. Apparently Abeta binds to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the Frizzled receptor (Fz) inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Cross-talk with other signaling cascades that regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, including the activation of M1 muscarinic receptor and PKC, the use of Ibuprofen-ChE bi-functional compounds, PPAR alpha, gamma agonists, nicotine and some antioxidants, results in neuroprotection against Abeta.

We describe a case of an apparent clear temporal relationship between standard ibuprofen dosing and palpitations. A review of the medical literature revealed this to be, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of this type.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 13-year-old Caucasian girl initially presented to our clinic with hamstring tendinitis. She was commenced on a medication regimen of paracetamol and ibuprofen. After the third ibuprofen dose, she experienced palpitations. These were associated with lower chest and/or upper abdominal discomfort, and a feeling of being hot and sweaty. Her symptoms ceased upon the cessation of ibuprofen therapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Cardiac arrhythmia is a potentially fatal disorder that may exhibit heart palpitations as its initial (or only) symptom.

Data were extracted from company clinical trial reports of randomised trials of celecoxib in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis lasting 2 weeks or more. Outcomes were discontinuations (all cause, lack of efficacy, adverse event, gastrointestinal adverse event), endoscopically detected ulcers, gastrointestinal or cardio-renal events, and major changes in haematological parameters. The main comparisons were celecoxib (all doses) versus placebo, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 4,000 mg daily, rofecoxib 25 mg daily, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (naproxen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and loxoprofen). For NSAIDs, celecoxib was compared both at all doses and at licensed doses (200 to 400 mg daily). Thirty-one trials included 39,605 randomised patients. Most patients had osteoarthritis and were women of average age 60 years or above. Most trials lasted 12 weeks or more. Doses of celecoxib were 50 to 800 mg/day. Compared with placebo, celecoxib had fewer discontinuations for any cause or for lack of efficacy, fewer serious adverse events, and less nausea. It had more patients with dyspepsia, diarrhoea, oedema, more adverse events that were gastrointestinal or treatment related, and more patients experiencing an adverse event. There were no differences for hypertension, gastrointestinal tolerability, or discontinuations for adverse events. Compared with paracetamol, celecoxib had fewer discontinuations for any cause, for lack of efficacy, or diarrhoea, but no other differences. Compared with rofecoxib, celecoxib had fewer patients with abdominal pain and oedema, but no other differences. Compared with NSAIDs, celecoxib had fewer symptomatic ulcers and bleeds, endoscopically detected ulcers, and discontinuations for adverse events or gastrointestinal adverse events. Fewer patients had any, or a gastrointestinal, or a treatment-related adverse event, or vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, or reduced haemoglobin or haematocrit. Discontinuations for lack of efficacy were higher. No differences were found for all-cause discontinuations, serious adverse events, hypertension, diarrhoea, nausea, oedema, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, or raised creatinine.

We investigated its efficacy and mechanism of action in the treatment of breast cancer in preclinical models.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated the anti-breast-cancer efficacy of P-I alone or incorporated into liposomes (Lipo-P-I) in human estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7) and triple-negative, i.e., estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-negative (MDA-MB231) breast cancer cell lines - as they represent the most frequent (estrogen receptor-positive) and the most difficult-to-treat (triple-negative) subtypes of breast cancer - and their xenografts in nude mice. We assessed the effect of P-I on the levels of reactive oxygen nitrogen species in response to P-I using molecular probes, on the thioredoxin system (expression and redox status of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) and thioredoxin reductase activity), on cyclooxygenase 2, NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase cell signaling; and on the growth of xenografts with stably knocked-down Trx-1.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with controls, P-I 400 mg/kg/day inhibited the growth of MDA-MB231 xenografts by 266%, while the growth of MCF-7 xenografts was inhibited 51% byP-I 300 mg/kg/day and 181% by Lipo-P-I 300 mg/kg/day. In both cell lines, P-I induced oxidative stress and suppressed the thioredoxin system (oxidized Trx-1 and decreased its expression; inhibited thioredoxin reductase activity). These changes triggered downstream redox signaling: the activity of NF-κB was suppressed and the Trx-1-ASK1 complex was dissociated, activating the p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Trx-1 knockdown abrogated the anti-cancer effect of P-I in vitro and in vivo.<h4>Conclusion</h4>P-I is safe and effective against breast cancer. Liposomal formulation enhances its efficacy; the effect is heavily dependent on the induction of oxidative stress and the suppression of the thioredoxin system. P-I merits further evaluation as an agent for the treatment of breast cancer.",2012,,"Sun Y, Rowehl LM, Huang L, Mackenzie GG, Vrankova K, Komninou D, Rigas B.",https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/bcr3105,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Severe toxicity is rare following deliberate self-poisoning with ibuprofen, and patients are usually either asymptomatic or develop only mild gastrointestinal toxicity. Although there have been nine other reported fatalities, co-existent factors have probably contributed to all of these deaths. We report here a fatality from isolated toxicity following self-poisoning with sustained-release ibuprofen.<h4>Case report</h4>A 26-year-old female presented after deliberate ingestion of up to 105 g sustained-release ibuprofen, with a reduced level of consciousness, severe metabolic acidosis and haemodynamic compromise. Despite intensive supportive management, gut decontamination with multidose activated charcoal and correction of the metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate and haemofiltration, the patient did not survive. The ibuprofen concentration ante mortem on presentation in peripheral blood was 760 mg/l and the concentrations post mortem were 518 mg/l in peripheral blood, 74 mg/kg in liver extract and 116 mg/l in the gastric contents.<h4>Discussion</h4>Most patients with ibuprofen poisoning are either asymptomatic or have mild gastrointestinal symptoms; severe poisoning with ibuprofen is rare.

Here we report a systems biology study that simultaneously describes the transcriptomic and phenotypic stress responses of the model crustacean Daphnia magna after exposure to ibuprofen.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings reveal intriguing similarities in the mode of action of ibuprofen between vertebrates and invertebrates, and they suggest that ibuprofen has a targeted impact on reproduction at the molecular, organismal, and population level in daphnids. Microarray expression and temporal real-time quantitative PCR profiles of key genes suggest early ibuprofen interruption of crustacean eicosanoid metabolism, which appears to disrupt signal transduction affecting juvenile hormone metabolism and oogenesis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Combining molecular and organismal stress responses provides a guide to possible chronic consequences of environmental stress for population health. This could improve current environmental risk assessment by providing an early indication of the need for higher tier testing.

Although the NF-κB pathway is involved in an increase in CGRP levels and activation of the trigeminal system in the NTG model, the relationship between NTG and neuroinflammation remains unclear. This study aimed to optimize a chronic NTG rat model with hyperalgesia and the ethological capacity for estimating migraine therapies and to further explore the underlying mechanism of NTG-induced migraine.<h4>Methods</h4>Rats were administered different doses of NTG s.c. daily or every 2 d; 30 min and 2 h later, the mechanical threshold was tested. After 9 d, the rats were injected with EB or Cy5.5 for the permeability assay. The other animals were sacrificed, and then, brainstem and caudal trigeminal ganglion were removed to test CGRP, c-Fos and NOS activity; Cytokines levels in the tissue and serum were measured by ELISA; and NF-κB pathway and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-related indicators were analyzed using western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe microglial polarization and IL-17A<sup>+</sup> T cell migration in the medulla oblongata.<h4>Results</h4>NTG (10 mg/kg, s.c., every 2 d for a total of 5 injections) was the optimal condition, resulting in progressive hyperalgesia and migraine behavior. TNC neuroinflammation with increases in cytokines, CGRP and c-Fos and activation of the NF-κB pathway was observed, and these changes were alleviated by ibuprofen. Furthermore, NTG administration increased BBB permeability by altering the levels functional proteins (RAGE, LRP1, AQP4 and MFSD2A) and structural proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and VE-cadherin-2) to increase peripheral IL-17A permeation into the medulla oblongata, activating microglia and neuroinflammation, and eventually causing hyperalgesia and migraine attack.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study confirmed that NTG (10 mg/kg, s.c., every 2 d for a total of 5 injections) was the optimal condition to provoke migraine, resulting in mechanical hyperalgesia and observable migraine-like behavior. Furthermore, IL-17A crossed the blood-brain barrier into the medulla oblongata, triggering TNC activation through microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. This process was a novel mechanism in NTG-induced chronic migraine, suggesting that IL-17A might be a novel target in the treatment of migraine.",2022,,"Chen H, Tang X, Li J, Hu B, Yang W, Zhan M, Ma T, Xu S.",https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s10194-021-01374-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We have reported increased serum inflammatory cytokines in a rat model of repetitive strain injury (rats perform an upper extremity reaching task for prolonged periods). Here, we sought to determine if sickness behaviors are induced in this model and the effectiveness of conservative treatments.<h4>Methods</h4>Experimental rats underwent initial training to learn a high force reaching task (10 min/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks), with or without ibuprofen treatment (TRHF vs. TRHF + IBU rats). Subsets of trained animals went on to perform a high repetition high force (HRHF) task for 6 or 12 weeks (2 h/day, 3 days/week) without treatment, or received two secondary interventions: ibuprofen (HRHF + IBU) or a move to a lower demand low repetition low force task (HRHF-to-LRLF), beginning in task week 5. Mixed-effects models with repeated measures assays were used to assay duration of social interaction, aggression, forepaw withdrawal thresholds and reach performance abilities. One-way and two-way ANOVAs were used to assay tissue responses. Corrections for multiple comparisons were made.<h4>Results</h4>TRHF + IBU rats did not develop behavioral declines or systemic increases in IL-1beta and IL-6, observed in untreated TRHF rats. Untreated HRHF rats showed social interaction declines, difficulties performing the operant task and forepaw mechanical allodynia. Untreated HRHF rats also had increased serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, neuroinflammatory responses (e.g., increased TNFalpha) in the brain, median nerve and spinal cord, and Substance P and neurokinin 1 immunoexpression in the spinal cord. HRHF + IBU and HRHF-to-LRLF rats showed improved social interaction and reduced inflammatory serum, nerve and brain changes. However, neither secondary treatment rescued HRHF-task induced forepaw allodynia, or completely attenuated task performance declines or spinal cord responses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results suggest that inflammatory mechanisms induced by prolonged performance of high physical demand tasks mediate the development of social interaction declines and aggression. However, persistent spinal cord sensitization was associated with persistent behavioral indices of discomfort, despite use of conservative secondary interventions indicating the need for prevention or more effective interventions.",2017,,"Xin DL, Hadrévi J, Elliott ME, Amin M, Harris MY, Barr-Gillespie AE, Barbe MF.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-017-0354-3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The present work showed that the repeated wounding caused the decreases in leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, and root length of Arabidopsis seedlings, while the exATP level was enhanced by the repeated wounding. Repeated application of exogenous ATP had similar effects on the plant growth, as the repeated wounding. Through the comparison of p2k1-3 mutant (in which T-DNA disrupted the gene coding P2K1, as exATP receptor) and wide type (WT) plants, it was found that the mutation in P2K1 decreased the sensitivity of plant growth to the repeated wounding and exogenous ATP application. Further works showed that the ibuprofen (IBU, an inhibitor of jasmonate biosynthesis) partially rescued the wound-induced growth degradation. In comparison, the P2K1 mutation partly rescued the wound-induced growth degradation, whereas this mutation failed to do so in the wounded seedlings treated with IBU, indicating that the role of exATP in regulating the growth degradation by repeated wounding could be linked to the JA signaling pathway.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In conclusion, these results indicate that exATP could be a regulator for the stunted growth of plants by repeated wounding.",2022,,"Shi Z, Wang H, Zhang Y, Jia L, Pang H, Feng H, Wang X.",https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12870-022-03656-z,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ultrasound(US)-guided unilateral single-shot 0.25% ropivacaine L-ESPB was performed in the ESPB group, but not in the control group. Postoperative analgesic strategy for all patients: patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA, diluted and dosed with fentanyl alone) was initiated immediately after surgery combined with oral compound codeine phosphate and ibuprofen sustained release tablets (1 tablet containing ibuprofen 200 mg and codeine 13 mg, 1 tablet/q12h) commenced 6 h postoperatively. We collected and compared patient-centred correlates intraoperatively and 48 h postoperatively. The primary outcomes were intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption and postoperative quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) scores.<h4>Results</h4>Compared to the control group (n = 56), the ESPB group (n = 58) significantly reduced intraoperative remifentanil consumption (estimated median difference - 280 mcg, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 360 to - 200, p < 0.001, power = 100%); significantly reduced fentanyl consumption at 24 h postoperatively (estimated median difference - 80mcg, 95%[CI] - 128 to - 32, p = 0.001, power = 90%); and significantly enhanced the QoR-15 score at 24 h postoperatively (estimated median difference 11, 95%[CI] 8 to 14, p < 0.001, power = 100%). Compared to the control group, the ESPB group enhanced the resting numeric rating scale (NRS) score up to 8 h postoperatively, and the active movement NRS score up to 4 h postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (p = 0.015, power = 70%), abdominal distension (p = 0.024, power = 64%), and muscular calf vein thrombosis (MCVT) (p = 0.033, power = 58%) was lower in the ESPB group than in the control group. Moreover, the occurrence of L-ESPB related adverse reactions was not found herein.<h4>Conclusion</h4>US-guided L-ESPB reduces intraoperative and 24 h postoperative opioid consumption and improves patients' QoR-15 scores at 24 h postoperatively.

On examination he had polyarticular synovitis. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST-elevation in leads I, II, III, aVF, and V2-V6 without reciprocal depression, and a high-sensitivity troponin level was significantly elevated.

Bladder inflammation reduces prostasin expression and a loss of prostasin expression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human bladder transitional cell carcinomas. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the incidence of various cancers including bladder cancer, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of NSAIDs are not fully understood.<h4>Methods</h4>The normal human bladder urothelial cell line UROtsa, the normal human trophoblast cell line B6Tert-1, human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell lines UM-UC-5 and UM-UC-9, and the human breast cancer cell line JIMT-1 were used for the study. Expression changes of the serine proteases prostasin and matriptase, and cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) in these cells following ibuprofen treatments were analyzed by means of reverse-transcription/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunoblotting. The functional role of the ibuprofen-regulated prostasin in epithelial tight junction formation and maintenance was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and epithelial permeability in the B6Tert-1 cells. Prostasin's effects on tight junctions were also evaluated in B6Tert-1 cells over-expressing a recombinant human prostasin, silenced for prostasin expression, or treated with a functionally-blocking prostasin antibody. Matriptase zymogen activation was examined in cells over-expressing prostasin.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen increased prostasin expression in the UROtsa and the B6Tert-1 cells. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was up-regulated at both the mRNA and the protein levels in the UROtsa cells by ibuprofen in a dose-dependent manner, but was not a requisite for up-regulating prostasin expression. The ibuprofen-induced prostasin contributed to the formation and maintenance of the epithelial tight junctions in the B6Tert-1 cells. The matriptase zymogen was down-regulated in the UROtsa cells by ibuprofen possibly as a result of the increased prostasin expression because over-expressing prostasin leads to matriptase activation and zymogen down-regulation in the UROtsa, JIMT-1, and B6Tert-1 cells. The expression of prostasin and matriptase was differentially regulated by ibuprofen in the bladder cancer cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen has been suggested for use in treating bladder cancer.

Despite the fact that it has been banned in many high-income countries following confirmed studies of fatal agranulocytosis and adverse drug reactions, it is still widely used in various countries of the world. However, the antipyretic therapeutic indications of dipyrone in febrile children are currently unknown, and there is little information on the advantages and disadvantages of using dipyrone in febrile children. In febrile children, we expected that dipyrone's antipyretic effectiveness wouldn't be any more effective than ibuprofen. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral dipyrone and oral ibuprofen as antipyretics in febrile children.<h4>Methods</h4>Several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, were searched thoroughly using a pre-established search strategy for potential research. The studies included in this analysis comprised randomized controlled trials that compared the antipyretic effects of oral ibuprofen and oral dipyrone in febrile children. Data analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.4 software.<h4>Results</h4>Three studies were selected among the 27 publications we discovered to be applicable, and they underwent qualitative and quantitative analysis. The pooled analysis revealed no discernible difference between oral dipyrone and oral ibuprofen in terms of their antipyretic effects (Mean difference (MD) = 0.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.08, 0.20).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both oral dipyrone and ibuprofen are effective in reducing high-temperature levels in febrile children without any significant difference.",2024,,"Alnajar M, Saker Z, Haji F, Abdelsamed MA, Khaled Z, Abd-ElGawad M.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-024-05095-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Current drugs used to diminish airway inflammation improve the clinical and spirometric status of patients with CF, but their use is limited due to their undesired side effects, for example, glucose intolerance, growth retardation, and cataracts with corticosteroids, gastrointestinal toxicity with ibuprofen, and macrolide resistance with azythromycin. Glycine is known to decrease activation of inflammatory cells, including alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, and is relatively inexpensive, palatable, and virtually devoid of untoward effects. These features make glycine a good candidate for antiinflammatory treatment of CF. Thus, we aimed to explore whether glycine can exert a beneficial effect in a population of patients with CF.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a randomized, double blinded, cross-over pilot clinical trial. Subjects with CF received, in random order, oral glycine (0.5 g/kg/day, dissolved in any liquid) and placebo (glass sugar), each during 8 weeks with an intermediate 2-week wash-out period.<h4>Results</h4>Thirteen subjects aged 6-23 years, 8 females, completed the two arms of the study. As compared with placebo, after glycine intake patients had better symptom questionnaire scores (p = 0.02), mainly regarding sputum features and dyspnea. While spirometric variables tended to decline during placebo intake, they remained stable or even increased during glycine treatment (p = 0.04 to p = 0.003). In this context, FEV<sub>1</sub> declined 8.6% after placebo and increased 9.7% at the end of the glycine period. Pulse oximetry improved after glycine intake (p = 0.04 vs. placebo). TNF-α in serum and IL-6 and G-CSF in sputum tended to decline at the end of the glycine period (p = 0.061, p = 0.068 and p = 0.04, respectively, vs placebo). Glycine was remarkably well tolerated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The clinical, spirometric and inflammatory status of subjects with CF improved after just 8 weeks of glycine intake, suggesting that this amino acid might constitute a novel therapeutic tool for these patients.

Sixty-nine patients underwent trigger finger surgery between December 2021 and October 2022 were randomized into one of three groups: oral Ibuprofen alone group, local Ketorolac alone group and local Ketorolac with oral Ibuprofen group. The assessment included postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, grip strength, mobility of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. and complications.<h4>Results</h4>NRS pain scores during movement of the operated fingers were significantly lower at 6 h in local Ketorolac alone group and local Ketorolac with oral Ibuprofen group compared to oral Ibuprofen alone group. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in postoperative DASH scores, grip strength, mobility of PIP joints, and complications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Local infiltration of Ketorolac as an adjunct in postoperative pain management has been shown to provide superior analgesia during finger movement within the initial 6 h following trigger finger surgery, in comparison to oral NSAIDs.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>Thaiclinicaltrials.org identifier: TCTR20210825002.

Thus, this review aimed to assess the efficacy of analgesics on the relief of pain in orthodontic treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>A computerized literature search was conducted in the databases of EMBASE (via OVID, 1974 to 2019 Week 50), MEDLINE (via OVID, 1946 to Dec 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (December 2019). The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software was applied in the present study. And methodological quality was evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.<h4>Results</h4>We identified twelve publications including 587 patients in 19 randomized controlled trials. The results showed that the mean difference of naproxen in visual analogue scale (VAS) were - 1.45 (95% CI -2.72, - 0.19; P = .02), - 2.11 (95% CI -3.96, - 0.26; P = .03) and - 1.90 (95% CI -3.33, - 0.47; P = .009) in 2 h, 6 h and 24 h respectively. As for ibuprofen, the standard mean differences were - 1.10 (95% CI -1.49, - 0.71), - 1.63(95% CI -2.32, - 0.95) and - 1.34 (95% CI -2.12, - 0.55) at 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h, with the overall P values all < 0.001. The mean difference of acetaminophen is - 0.68, - 1.34, - 1.91 at three time points and the overall P values all < 0.01.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This meta-analysis suggests that the use of analgesics is effective for patients in controlling orthodontic pain. Ibuprofen and naproxen are both of stable analgesic effects which could peak at 6 h, while the analgesic effect of acetaminophen increases steadily from 2 h through 24 h. Compared with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, naproxen shows a stronger analgesic effect either at 2 h or 6 h, and its effect lasts to 24 h.",2020,,"Cheng C, Xie T, Wang J.",https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12903-020-01245-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A total of 68 patients seeking miniscrew insert placement were recruited based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the ibuprofen group or the control group, with 34 patients in each group. The ibuprofen group and the control group received 300 mg of ibuprofen sustained-release capsules and a placebo, respectively, 30 min before surgery. Postoperative analgesics were administered as needed. Pain scores at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postoperatively were recorded using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and the postoperative analgesic consumption was documented.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 68 patients (34 in the control group and 34 in the preemptive analgesia group) completed the trial. No adverse events such as nausea or vomiting occurred in any of the patients. The preemptive analgesia group exhibited significantly lower pain scores at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h postoperatively [2 (0,3), 0 (0,2), 0 (0,0), 0 (0,0.25), respectively] compared to the control group [3 (2,5), 3 (2,4), 2 (0.75,4), 1 (0,3), respectively] (P = 0.0396, P = 0.0067, P = 0.0111, P = 0.0299). The proportions of patients requiring additional analgesics within 2-24 h postoperatively were 17.6% (6/34) in the preemptive analgesia group and 64.7% (22/34) in the control group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.013).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Preemptive analgesia with ibuprofen can effectively reduce postoperative pain following miniscrew insert placement and represents a safe and effective perioperative pain management strategy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The UK's Clinical Study Registry; ISRCTN68332234 (Retrospectively registered); 20/12/2024.",2025,,"Zhang HY, Rui CC, Su LW, Xiao YJ, Nie MD, Sun H, Wu Y.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-025-05660-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite its high prevalence, the evidence is limited regarding the management-seeking practices and its perceived effectiveness among females with PD.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 550 female students in six universities across Lebanon. The prevalence of PD, associated risk factors, and management-seeking practices were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of PD was 80.9%. Most of the females with PD described their menstrual pain as moderate (56%) to severe (34.6%), which significantly affected their daily activities and studying ability (P < 0.001). The major risk factors associated with PD included heavy menstrual flow (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 10.28), family history of PD (AOR = 2.52), history of weight loss attempt (AOR = 2.05), and medical specialization (AOR = 1.663). Only 36.9% of females with PD sought formal medical advice. Most dysmenorrheic females (76.4%) received medications for the management of PD, and remarkably none of them took hormonal contraceptives. Drugs commonly used for PD were mefenamic acid (26.2%), ibuprofen (25%), and paracetamol (11.5%), which were administered when the pain started (58.2%). All medications were significantly effective in reducing the pain score (P = 0.001), and most NSAIDs were more potent than paracetamol in managing PD (P = 0.001). However, no significant difference in adverse effects among medications was revealed. Moreover, no superiority of any individual NSAID for pain relief was established. Nevertheless, mefenamic acid was associated with the lowest risk of abdominal pain (OR: 0.03, P = 0.005) and the highest risk of flank pain (OR = 12, P = 0.02).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Suboptimal management of PD is practiced among university students in Lebanon. Therefore, health care providers should educate dysmenorrheic females to optimize the self-management support of PD. Furthermore, future research is required to investigate females' misconceptions about hormonal contraceptives in the management of PD, aiming to raise awareness and correct misconceptions.",2021,,"Karout S, Soubra L, Rahme D, Karout L, Khojah HMJ, Itani R.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01532-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this study the immunosuppressive effects of G. segetum and its constituents were investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>Isolation of compounds from G. segetum leaves was conducted using vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) and column chromatography (CC). Two new compounds, namely 4,5,4'-trihydroxychalcone and 8,8'-(ethene-1,2-diyl)-dinaphtalene-1,4,5-triol, together with stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were isolated from G. segetum methanol extract and their structures were determined spectroscopically. The presence of gallic acid and rutin in the extract was determined quantitatively by a validated HPLC method. G. segetum methanol extract and its constituents were investigated for their effects on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, β2 integrin (CD18) expression, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), lymphocytes proliferation, cytokine release and nitric oxide (NO) production of phagocytes.<h4>Results</h4>All the samples significantly inhibited all the innate immune responses tested except CD 18 expression on surface of leukocytes. Among the samples, 8,8'-(ethene-1,2-diyl)-dinaphtalene-1,4,5-triol exhibited the strongest inhibitory on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, ROS and NO production. The compound exhibited exceptionally strong inhibitions on ROS and chemotaxis activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values lower than the positive controls, aspirin and ibuprofen, respectively. 4,5,4'-Trihydroxychalcone revealed the strongest immunosuppressive activity on proliferation of lymphocytes (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.52 μM) and on release of IL-1β (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 6.69 μM).

(Euphorbiaceae) leaves in experimental rats.,"<h4>Background</h4>The medicinal plants signify a massive basin of potential phytoconstituents that could be valuable as a substitute to allopathic drugs or considered as an analogue in drug development. Phyllanthus niruri L. (Euphorbiaceae) is generally used in traditional medicine to treat ulcer and inflammation. In this project we investigated the methanolic extract of leaves of Phyllanthus niruri for anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer activity.<h4>Methods</h4>The anti-inflammatory activity of methanol extract of Phyllanthus niruri leaves was evaluated at the doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o. while using ibuprofen (20 mg/kg, p.o) as the standard drug. The animals used were Swiss albino rats. Inflammation was induced by injecting 0.1 ml carrageenan (1% w/v) into the left hind paw. Paw tissues from the different groups were examined for inflammatory cell infiltration. On the other hand, antiulcer activity of methanolic extract of P. niruri leaves at the doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o. were examined against ethanol-acid induced gastric mucosal injury in the Swiss albino rats - keeping omeprazole (20 mg/kg, p.o.) as reference. The rats were dissected and the stomachs were macroscopically examined to identify hemorrhagic lesions in the glandular mucosa.<h4>Results</h4>P. niruri significantly (p < 0.01) decreased carrageenan-induced paw edema; it exhibited a reduction of 46.80%, 55.32% and 69.14% at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively. These findings were further supported by the histological study. The methanolic extract also disclosed good protective effect against ethanol-acid induced gastric mucosal injury in the rats. Administration of the extract's doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) demonstrated a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the ethanol- acid induced gastric erosion in all the experimental groups when compared to the control. The methanolic extract at the higher dose (400 mg/kg) resulted in better inhibition of ethanol-acid induced gastric ulcer as compare to omeprazole (20 mg/kg). Histological studies of the gastric wall revealed that toxic control rats revealed mucosal degeneration, ulceration and migration of numerous inflammatory cells throughout the section. On the other hand, MEPN treatment groups showed significant regeneration of mucosal layer and significantly prevented the formation of hemorrhage and edema.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The investigation suggests that methanolic extract of P. niruri leaf possess anti-inflammatory activity and promotes ulcer protection as ascertained by regeneration of mucosal layer and substantial prevention of the formation of hemorrhage and edema.",2017,,"Mostofa R, Ahmed S, Begum MM, Sohanur Rahman M, Begum T, Ahmed SU, Tuhin RH, Das M, Hossain A, Sharma M, Begum R.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1771-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Lam. is a functional food and belongs to family Convolvulaceae. It is used as an antiinflammatory, aphrodisiac, antiasthmatic, anticonvalescent, antitumor, antanemic and antidiabetic agent by local communities. This study has been planned to evaluate its antiinflammatory and antiarthritic potentials.<h4>Methods</h4>Dry powder of I. batatas tuber and roots were extracted with ethyl acetate (IPT-EA, IPR-EA) and methanol (IPT-M, IPR-M), respectively. These extracts were tested for total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC), HPLC finger printing, multidimensional in vitro and in vivo antioxidant potential and albumin denaturation inhibition. Carrageenan-induced paw edema, croton oil-induced ear and anal edema inhibition and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced antiarthritic assays were executed at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight on Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum levels of interleukins IL-1β and IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO) were assessed to measure the inhibition of inflammation.<h4>Results</h4>Maximal TPC (319.81 ± 14.20 μg GAE/mg dry extract) and TFC (208.77 ± 9.09 μg QE/mg DE) were estimated in IPR-EA extract. IPT-EA and IPR-EA yielded the maximum amounts of rutin (7.3 ± 1.12 and 4.5 ± 0.55), caffeic acid (1.60 ± 0.25 and 2.17 ± 0.26) and myricetin (2.7 ± 0.14 and 1.01 ± 0.08 μg/mg DE), respectively in HPLC-DAD analysis. All extracts showed dose dependent response in in vitro antioxidant assays. Best inhibition (76.92 ± 3.07%) of albumin denaturation was shown by IPT-EA in comparison to ibuprofen (79.48 ± 4.71%). IPR-EA exhibited highest edema inhibition in models of carrageenan-induced paw edema (79.11 ± 5.47%) and croton oil-induced ear and anal edema (72.01 ± 7.80% and 70.80 ± 4.94%, respectively). Significant inhibition of CFA-induced arthritic edema and arthritic score were observed by IPR-EA as compared to ibuprofen. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6) and NO levels was shown by IPR-EA and IPT-EA, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results depict that richness of polyphenols and phytoconstituents in I. batatas ameliorates oxidative stress and inflammation of acute and chronic nature.

In this research, magnetic@layered double hydroxide multicore@shell nanostructure was synthesized by the facile experiment and is used as novel drug nanocarrier.<h4>Methods</h4>Magnetic nanospheres were synthesized by a facile one-step solvothermal route, and then, layered double hydroxide nanoflakes were prepared on the magnetic nanospheres by coprecipitation experiment. The synthesized nanostructures were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, VSM, and TEM, respectively. After intercalation with Ibuprofen and Diclofenac as anti-inflammatory drugs and using exchange anion experiment, the basal spacing of synthesized layered double hydroxides was compared with brucite nanosheets from 0.48 nm to 2.62 nm and 2.22 nm, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>The results indicated that Ibuprofen and Diclofenac were successfully intercalated into the interlay space of LDHs via bridging bidentate interaction. In addition, in-vitro drug release experiments in pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) showed constant release profiles with Ibuprofen and Diclofenac as model drugs with different lipophilicity, water solubility, size, and steric effect.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LDH-ibuprofen and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LDH-diclofenac had the advantage of the strong interaction between the carboxyl groups with higher trivalent cations by bridging bidentate, clarity, and high thermal stability.

In A-T mouse models, LPS-induced neuroinflammation advances the degenerative changes found in cerebellar Purkinje neurons both in vivo and in vitro. In the current study, we ask whether ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can have the opposite effect and delay the symptoms of the disease.<h4>Methods</h4>We tested the beneficial effects of ibuprofen in both in vitro and in vivo models. Conditioned medium from LPS stimulated primary microglia (LM) applied to cultures of dissociated cortical neurons leads to numerous degenerative changes. Pretreatment of the neurons with ibuprofen, however, blocked this damage. Systemic injection of LPS into either adult wild-type or adult Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice produced an immune challenge that triggered profound behavioral, biochemical, and histological effects. We used a 2-week ibuprofen pretreatment regimen to investigate whether these LPS effects could be blocked. We also treated young presymptomatic Atm<sup>-/-</sup> mice to determine if ibuprofen could delay the appearance of symptoms.<h4>Results</h4>Adding ibuprofen directly to neuronal cultures significantly reduced LM-induced degeneration. Curiously, adding ibuprofen to the microglia cultures before the LPS challenge had little effect, thus implying a direct effect of the NSAID on the neuronal cultures. In vivo administration of ibuprofen to Atm<sup>-/-</sup> animals before a systemic LPS immune challenge suppressed cytological damage. The ibuprofen effects were widespread as microglial activation, p38 phosphorylation, DNA damage, and neuronal cell cycle reentry were all reduced. Unfortunately, ibuprofen only slightly improved the LPS-induced behavioral deficits. Yet, while the behavioral symptoms could not be reversed once they were established in adult Atm<sup>-/-</sup> animals, administration of ibuprofen to young mutant pups prevented their symptoms from appearing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Inflammatory processes impact the normal progression of A-T implying that modulation of the immune system can have therapeutic benefit for both the behavioral and cellular symptoms of this neurodegenerative disease.",2018,,"Hui CW, Song X, Ma F, Shen X, Herrup K.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1338-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Unfortunately, current treatments for these diseases are limited at best. Genetic and other preclinical evidence suggest a relationship between retinal degeneration and inflammation. To further explore this relationship, we tested whether Ibuprofen (IBU), an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), could promote PR survival and function in a mouse model of light damage (LD)-induced PR degeneration.<h4>Methods</h4>LD was induced by exposing mice to 4000 lx of light for 2-4 hours (h). IBU (100 or 200 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by daily intraperitoneal injection. Retinal structure and function were evaluated by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and electroretinography (ERG). Cell death genes were analyzed at 24 and 72 h after LD using the Mouse Pan-Cell Death Pathway PCR Array (88 genes). The cellular location and protein expression of key necroptosis genes were assessed by immunohistochemistry.<h4>Results</h4>Retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness in vehicle-injected LD animals was 8.7 ± 0.6% of retinas without LD (p < 0.0001). In IBU 200 mg/kg treated mice, central ONL thickness was 74.9 ± 7.7% of untreated retinas (p < 0.001). A-wave and b-wave ERG amplitudes were significantly preserved in IBU-treated animals. IBU significantly inhibited retinal inflammation. Twenty-four hour after LD, retinal mRNA expression for the inflammatory-factors tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), interleukin-1 beta (Il1B), and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) increased by 10-, 17-, and 533-fold, respectively; in IBU-treated animals, the expression levels of these inflammatory factors were not significantly different from no-LD controls. Expression of key necroptosis genes, including Ripk3 and Mlkl, were upregulated in LD vehicle-treated mice, but dramatically reduced to near no LD levels in LD IBU-treated mice. Microglia activation and MLKL protein upregulation were observed primarily in photoreceptors 12 h after LD, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. IBU reduced the upregulation of MLKL protein and microglia migration in the ONL and outer plexiform layer (OPL) of treated retinas.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Systemic administration of the anti-inflammatory drug IBU partially protected mouse retinas from light-induced photochemical damage and inhibited both inflammation and the necroptosis cell death pathways.

However, our knowledge about the safe usage of anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy is still limited. While human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC)-derived brain organoid models have started to explore functional consequences upon viral stimulation, these models commonly lack microglia, which are susceptible to and promote inflammation. Furthermore, microglia are actively involved in neuronal development. Here, we generate hIPSC-derived microglia precursor cells and assemble them into retinal organoids. Once the outer plexiform layer forms, these hIPSC-derived microglia (iMG) fully integrate into the retinal organoids. Since the ganglion cell survival declines by this time in 3D-retinal organoids, we adapted the model into 2D and identify that the improved ganglion cell number significantly decreases only with iMG presence. In parallel, we applied the immunostimulant POLY(I:C) to mimic a fetal viral infection. While POLY(I:C) exposure alters the iMG phenotype, it does not hinder their interaction with ganglion cells. Furthermore, iMG significantly enhance the supernatant's inflammatory secretome and increase retinal cell proliferation. Simultaneous exposure with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen dampens POLY(I:C)-mediated changes of the iMG phenotype and ameliorates cell proliferation. Remarkably, while POLY(I:C) disrupts neuronal calcium dynamics independent of iMG, ibuprofen rescues this effect only if iMG are present. Mechanistically, ibuprofen targets the enzymes cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX1/PTGS1 and COX2/PTGS2) simultaneously, from which iMG mainly express COX1. Selective COX1 blockage fails to restore the calcium peak amplitude upon POLY(I:C) stimulation, suggesting ibuprofen's beneficial effect depends on the presence and interplay of COX1 and COX2. These findings underscore the importance of microglia in the context of prenatal immune challenges and provide insight into the mechanisms by which ibuprofen exerts its protective effects during embryonic development.",2025,,"Schmied V, Korkut-Demirbaş M, Venturino A, Maya-Arteaga JP, Siegert S.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-025-03366-x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We have previously discovered that combinations of BBB nutrient transporter ligands alanine and glutathione (A-GSH), increase the permeability of vesicular and polypeptide nanocarriers containing model cargo across the BBB. Our aim was to investigate dopamine- and ibuprofen-coupled 3-armed poly(L-glutamic acid) nanocarriers targeted by A-GSH for transfer across a novel human co-culture model with induced BBB properties. In addition, the protective effect of ibuprofen containing nanoparticles on cytokine-induced barrier damage was also measured.<h4>Method</h4>Drug-coupled nanocarriers were synthetized and characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular effects, uptake, and permeability of the nanoparticles were investigated on a human stem cell-based co-culture BBB model with improved barrier properties induced by a small molecular cocktail. The model was characterized by immunocytochemistry and permeability for marker molecules. Nanocarrier uptake in human brain endothelial cells and midbrain organoids was quantified by spectrofluorometry and visualized by confocal microscopy. The mechanisms of cellular uptake were explored by addition of free targeting ligands, endocytic and metabolic inhibitors, co-localization of nanocarriers with intracellular organs, and surface charge modification of cells. The protective effect of ibuprofen-coupled nanocarriers was investigated against cytokine-induced barrier damage by impedance and permeability measurements.<h4>Results</h4>Targeted nanoformulations of both drugs showed elevated cellular uptake in a time-dependent, active manner via endocytic mechanisms. Addition of free ligands inhibited the cellular internalization of targeted nanocarriers suggesting the crucial role of ligands in the uptake process. A higher permeability across the BBB model was measured for targeted nanocarriers. After crossing the BBB, targeted dopamine nanocarriers subsequently entered midbrain-like organoids derived from healthy and Parkinson's disease patient-specific stem cells.

However, the mechanisms underlying pain-induced anxiety, such as its causality, temporal progression, and relevant neural networks are poorly understood, impeding the development of efficacious therapeutic approaches.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we have identified the sequential emergence of anxiety phenotypes in mice subjected to dental pulp injury (DPI), a prototypical model of orofacial pain that correlates with human toothache. Compared with sham controls, mice subjected to DPI by mechanically exposing the pulp to the oral environment exhibited significant signs of anxiogenic effects, specifically, altered behaviors on the elevated plus maze (EPM), novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) tests at 1 but not 3 days after the surgery. Notably, at 7 and 14 days, the DPI mice again avoided the open arm, center area, and novelty environment in the EPM, open field, and NSF tests, respectively. In particular, DPI-induced social phobia and increased repetitive grooming did not occur until 14 days after surgery, suggesting that DPI-induced social anxiety requires a long time. Moreover, oral administration of an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, or an analgesic agent, ProTx-II, which is a selective inhibitor of NaV1.7 sodium channels, both significantly alleviated DPI-induced avoidance in mice. Finally, to investigate the underlying central mechanisms, we pharmacologically blocked a popular form of synaptic plasticity with a GluA2-derived peptide, long-term depression, as that treatment significantly prevented the development of anxiety phenotype upon DPI.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Together, these results suggest a temporally progressive causal relationship between orofacial pain and anxiety, calling for more in-depth mechanistic studies on concomitant pain and anxiety disorders.",2015,,"Shang L, Xu TL, Li F, Su J, Li WG.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1186/s12990-015-0040-3,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

They were randomly assigned into four treatment groups, an ibuprofen (positive control) group, two test groups of ECa233 each of 250 mg, and 500 mg extracts, and a placebo (negative control) group. All subjects were requested to self-administer the test/control capsules, twice a day for 14 days. The pain intensity score, range of mandibular motion and tenderness of the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were recorded at baseline, 7- and 14-days post-treatment.<h4>Results</h4>One week after intervention, the pain intensity score significantly decreased in participants receiving 500 mg of ECa233 (P = 0.016), as well as the placebo group (P = 0.030) but not in the other groups. Additionally, those receiving 500 mg of ECa233 displayed the highest percentage reduction in self-reported pain intensity and pain on TMJ palpation compared with the other groups (P > 0.050). On day 14, there were no significant differences observed among the evaluated parameters in the four groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The orally administered ECa233 has the potential to induce rapid, short term, dose-dependent analgesia in individuals with TMD pain.

Moreover, conditioned media harvested from irradiated murine bone marrow, lung, and liver chemoattracted human ovarian cancer cells, and this chemotactic activity was inactivated by heat, suggesting a major involvement of peptide or peptide-bound chemoattractants. We also observed that human ovarian cancer cells proliferate better if exposed to cell debris harvested from irradiated murine bone marrow. Finally, the pro-metastatic microenvironment in mice induced by radio- or chemotherapy was significantly ameliorated if animals were treated at the time of radiotherapy administration with non-steroid (ibuprofen) or steroid (prednisone) anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, we propose that a radiochemotherapy-induced, pro-metastatic microenvironment plays an important role in the metastasis of cancer cells that are resistant to treatment.

Many childhood episodic syndromes have been described as common precursors of migraine.<h4>Objective</h4>To review current knowledge on migraine and childhood episodic syndromes, and to discuss future directions for research and clinical practice.<h4>Findings</h4>For most children it is difficult to describe a headache and fully verbalize symptoms such as photophobia and phonophobia that must be inferred from behaviour. Classical migraine features are rare before the age of 6 years, but some migraine-related syndromes have been described. Benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, cyclic vomiting syndrome and abdominal migraine are currently classified as childhood episodic syndromes, and therefore common precursors of migraine. A strong association between infantile colic and migraine has recently been reported. There are similarities between children with episodic syndromes and children with migraine, regarding social and demographic factors, precipitating and relieving factors, and accompanying gastrointestinal, neurologic, and vasomotor features. The real pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine are not fully understood. Current data obtained through molecular and functional studies provide a complex model in which vascular and neurologic events cooperate in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. Genetic factors causing disturbances in neuronal ion channels, make a migraineur more sensitive to multiple trigger factors that activate the nociception cascade. The expanding knowledge on migraine genetics and pathophysiology may be applicable to childhood episodic syndromes. Migraine preventive strategies are particularly important in children, and could be beneficial in childhood episodic syndromes. Nonspecific analgesics like ibuprofen and acetaminophen are widely used in pediatrics to control pain and have been found to be effective also in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Triptans are the specific fist-line drugs for acute migraine treatment.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Migraine phenotype differs somewhat in the developing brain, and childhood episodic syndromes may arise before typical migraine headache. Diagnosing pediatric migraine may be difficult because of children's language and cognitive abilities. The risk of underestimating migraine in pediatric age is high. An adequate diagnosis is important to maintain a good quality of life and to avoid inappropriate therapy.",2014,,"Spiri D, Rinaldi VE, Titomanlio L.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-014-0092-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Effective management of these conditions is essential to ensuring comfort and preventing complications. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen are the most frequently used medications for treating fever and pain in children owing to their proven efficacy and safety profiles when used appropriately. However, despite their widespread use, both medications have the potential of having serious adverse effects if misused, highlighting the importance of therapeutic awareness among healthcare providers. A careful evaluation of current clinical guidelines for fever and pain management in children was carried out. A survey of recommendations regarding the dosing, timing, and combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen was also conducted in order to optimize treatment while minimizing risks. Recent evidence supports the combination of these two drugs as both effective and safe for managing moderate to severe pain in pediatric patients, offering enhanced symptom relief without significant increases in side effects.

Patients received a CH loading-dose of 10 mg/kg enterally, then a syringe-pump enteral infusion at 5 mg/kg/hour, increasing to a maximum of 9 mg/kg/hour. Cases were compared to historical controls matched for age group and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (PRISM) category, using Fisher's exact test and the t test. The primary outcome was feasibility, defined as the use of an enteral CH continuous infusion without discontinuation attributable to a pre-specified potential harm.<h4>Results</h4>There were 21 patients enrolled, at age 11.4 (12.1) months, with bronchiolitis in 10 (48%), a mean Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score of 6.2 (5.2), and having received enteral CH continuous infusion for 4.5 (2.2) days. Infusion of CH was feasible in 20/21 (95%; 95% CI 76-99%) patients, with one (5%) adverse event of duodenal ulcer perforation on day 3 in a patient with croup receiving regular ibuprofen and dexamethasone. The CH infusion dose (mg/kg/h) on day 2 (n = 20) was 8.9 (IQR 5.9, 9), and on day 4 (n = 11) was 8.8 (IQR 7, 9). Days to titration of adequate sedation (defined as ≤ 3 PRN doses/shift) was 1 (IQR 0.5, 2.5), and hours to awakening for extubation was 5 (IQR 2, 9). Cases (versus controls) had less positive fluid balance at 48 h (-2 (45) vs. 26 (46) ml/kg, p = 0.051), and a decrease in number of PRN sedation doses from 12 h pre to 12 hours post starting CH (4.7 (3.3) to 2.6 (2.8), p = 0.009 versus 2.9 (3.9) to 3.4 (5), p = 0.74). There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls in inotrope scores, signs or treatment of withdrawal, or PICU days.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Delivering CH by continuous enteral infusion is feasible, effective, and may be associated with less positive fluid balance.

It can produce strong firepower, infrared thermal radiation, and medicinal effects when burning on the acupoints. Thunder-fire moxibustion is commonly used in patients with neck pain, but its efficacy has rarely been systematically demonstrated. We designed a randomized trial of thunder-fire moxibustion on cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR) to investigate whether it is more effective than ibuprofen sustained-release capsules.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred patients will be recruited and randomly divided into thunder-fire moxibustion and ibuprofen groups. The intervention consists of ten treatments and will last for 2 weeks. The Yasuhisa Tanaka 20 Score Scale is used as the primary outcome measure. It contains a combination of the self-conscious symptom in patients, objective clinical evaluation from doctors, and social evaluation (the ability to work and live). The objective and comprehensive evaluation of CSR patients before and after treatment is particularly needed. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2), Neck Disability Index score scale (NDI), and the Quality of Life Assessment (SF-36) are applied as secondary outcome measures. The assessment will take place at the baseline and the first and second weekends of treatment. If an adverse event (AEs) occurs, it will be reported.<h4>Discussion</h4>The aim of this trial is to determine whether thunder-fire moxibustion is more effective than ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with CSR.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn), ChiCTR1800018820.

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used worldwidely to treat several pain-related diseases including migraines. However, whether EA with low or high frequency exerts a distinct analgesic effect remains unknown and needs further study.<h4>Methods/design</h4>This study is a randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with three parallel arms. A total of 144 migraine outpatients will be randomly allocated to the 2 Hz EA group, 100 Hz EA group and placebo control group. The duration of the trial is 20 weeks, including a 4-week-long baseline assessment period (weeks - 4-0), a 4-week-long treatment period (weeks 1-4) and a 12-week-long follow-up period (weeks 5-16). Twelve treatment sessions will be performed over a 4-week period (weeks 1-4). The primary outcome will be measured by the frequency of migraine attacks in the past 4 weeks at the end of week 4 post-randomisation. The secondary outcome will be measured by the frequency of migraine attacks in the past 4 weeks at the end of weeks 8, 12 and16 post-randomisation; number of days with migraine; dosage of ibuprofen; the scores of visual analogue scale (VAS); Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS); and Migraine Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MSQ) in the past 4 weeks at the end of weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 post-randomisation. Safety assessment, compliance and blinding evaluation will be carried out at the end of week 16 post-randomisation.<h4>Discussion</h4>The recruitment will be started on 1 June 2021 and expected to finish on 31 May 2023.

Dentists are among the leading prescribers of opioid analgesics. Opioid-seeking behaviors have been linked to receipt of initial opioid prescriptions following the common dental procedure of third molar extraction. With each opioid prescription, a patient's risk for opioid misuse or abuse increases. With an estimated 56 million tablets of 5 mg hydrocodone annually prescribed after third molar extractions in the USA, 3.5 million young adults may be unnecessarily exposed to opioids by dentists who are inadvertently increasing their patient's risk for addiction.<h4>Methods</h4>A double-blind, stratified randomized, multi-center clinical trial has been designed to evaluate whether a combination of over-the-counter non-opioid-containing analgesics is not inferior to the most prescribed opioid analgesic. The impacted 3rd molar extraction model is being used due to the predictable severity of the post-operative pain and generalizability of results. Within each site/clinic and gender type (male/female), patients are randomized to receive either OPIOID (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/300 mg) or NON-OPIOID (ibuprofen/acetaminophen 400/500 mg). Outcome data include pain levels, adverse events, overall patient satisfaction, ability to sleep, and ability to perform daily functions. To develop clinical guidelines and a clinical decision-making tool, pain management, extraction difficulty, and the number of tablets taken are being collected, enabling an experimental decision-making tool to be developed.<h4>Discussion</h4>The proposed methods address the shortcomings of other analgesic studies. Although prior studies have tested short-term effects of single doses of pain medications, patients and their dentists are interested in managing pain for the entire post-operative period, not just the first 12 h. After surgery, patients expect to be able to perform normal daily functions without feeling nauseous or dizzy and they desire a restful sleep at night. Parents of young people are concerned with the risks of opioid use and misuse, related either to treatments received or to subsequent use of leftover pills. Upon successful completion of this clinical trial, dentists, patients, and their families will be better able to make informed decisions regarding post-operative pain management.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04452344 .

The systematic stratification of patients for personalized treatment does not exist for TB. As each TB case is different, individualized treatment regimens should be applied to obtain better outcomes. In this scenario, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to (1) improve outcomes and (2) shorten treatment duration, and host-directed therapies (HDT) might be the best solution. Within HDT, repurposed drugs represent a shortcut in drug development and can be implemented at the short term. As hyperinflammation is associated with worse outcomes, HDT with an anti-inflammatory effect might improve outcomes by reducing tissue damage and thus the risk of permanent sequelae.<h4>Methods</h4>SMA-TB is a multicentre randomized, phase IIB, placebo-controlled, three-arm, double-blinded clinical trial (CT) that has been designed in the context of the EC-funded SMA-TB Project ( www.smatb.eu ) in which we propose to use 2 common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and ibuprofen (Ibu), as an HDT for use as adjunct therapy added to, and compared with, the standard of care (SoC) World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended TB regimen in TB patients. A total of 354 South African and Georgian adults diagnosed with confirmed pulmonary TB will be randomized into SoC TB treatment + placebo, SoC + acetylsalicylic acid or SoC + ibuprofen.<h4>Discussion</h4>SMA-TB will provide proof of concept of the HDT as a co-adjuvant treatment and identify the suitability of the intervention for different population groups (different epidemiological settings and drug susceptibility) in the reduction of tissue damage and risk of bad outcomes for TB patients. This regimen potentially will be more effective and targeted: organ saving, reducing tissue damage and thereby decreasing the length of treatment and sequelae, increasing cure rates and pathogen clearance and decreasing transmission rates. It will result in better clinical practice, care management and increased well-being of TB patients.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04575519.

MED,27222654,27222654,10.1186/s13223-016-0127-z,"Allergen inhalation challenge, refractoriness and the effects of ibuprofen.","<h4>Background</h4>Bronchoprovocation challenges use direct or indirect acting stimuli to induce airflow obstruction. Indirect stimuli either non-allergic/non-IgE mediated (e.g. exercise, mannitol) or allergic/IgE mediated (i.e. allergen) trigger mast cells to release bronchoconstricting mediators (e.g. cysteinyl leukotrienes, histamine). Performing repeat challenges within a short timeframe (e.g. 3 h) with non-allergic indirect stimuli results in a diminished, refractory response to the second challenge that is inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Cross refractoriness occurs between indirect stimuli. It follows that repeat bronchoprovocation with allergen might exhibit refractoriness that might be altered by ibuprofen. We assessed the response to a second allergen challenge performed 24 h after an initial allergen challenge to determine if the response is refractory. If refractoriness developed, the study aimed to determine whether a single dose of ibuprofen would alter the refractory response to the second allergen challenge. In the absence of a refractory response, the study design allowed for the assessment of the effect of ibuprofen on allergen challenge outcomes, including indices of airway inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>Thirteen mild atopic asthmatics were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo was administered 1 h prior to the first of two allergen challenges, performed 24 h apart. Blood and sputum eosinophils, airway responsiveness to methacholine and levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide were assessed before and 7 h after each allergen challenge. All data were log transformed and differences in geometric means were analyzed by paired t-tests.<h4>Results</h4>After placebo, early asthmatic responses for the two challenges were not significantly different (p = 0.82). A single 400 mg dose of ibuprofen decreased both the early (p = 0.03; n = 12) and late asthmatic responses (p = 0.03; n = 3).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Allergen challenges conducted 24 h apart do not exhibit refractoriness. Single dose ibuprofen inhibits early and late asthmatic responses to allergen bronchoprovocation.

Despite therapeutic advances, the etiology of refractory vasculitides remains incompletely understood. Recently, (non)immunological mechanisms bypassing T cells and IgE have been proposed to explain resistance to standard immunosuppressants. Herein, we report a case of refractory drug-induced systemic small-vessel vasculitis with varied extracutaneous manifestations and incorporate multiple sources of data to provide detailed accounts of complex (non)immunological phenomena involved in this case. Study objectives are to provide an insight about rare presentations of commonly used drugs, upgrade the pathophysiological concepts of drug-induced vasculitis, raise need for further investigation to define causes and risk factors for refractory vasculitis, and discuss most of the current knowledge suggesting novel therapeutic approaches to treat this vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of the two flares of systemic small-vessel vasculitis in a single patient in response to clopidogrel and ticagrelor exposure, respectively. However, this report is limited by attribution/observer bias.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We herein report a 24-year-old Caucasian male student with a medical history of mild seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, tension-type headaches, posttraumatic arterial stenosis, and previous exposure to ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, and mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine who suffered largely from acute urticaria and dyspnea after 20 days of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel introduction. A skin punch biopsy confirmed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Serologic antibody testing, complement analysis, microbiologic testing, and cancer biomarkers revealed no abnormalities. Regarding the patient's medical history, both acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were exchanged for ticagrelor. Furthermore, the addition of naproxen, cyclosporine, bilastine, prednisolone, and montelukast resulted in complete recovery. After 7 days, diarrhea and hematuria occurred. Urinalysis and computed tomography showed reversible proteinuria with gross hematuria and hypodense changes in kidney medulla, respectively, associated with discontinuation of ticagrelor and naproxen. In addition, the patient recovered completely without any immunosuppression up-titration.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case highlights the role of clopidogrel and ticagrelor as possible triggering agents for systemic small-vessel vasculitis and offers an insight into novel therapeutic strategies for refractory vasculitides.

However, NSAIDs were recently shown to impede the muscle healing process after acute injury. Migration of skeletal muscle cells is a crucial step during the muscle healing process. The present study was performed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanisms of action of ibuprofen, a commonly used NSAID, on the migration of skeletal muscle cells.<h4>Methods</h4>Skeletal muscle cells isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle of Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ibuprofen. MTT assay (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was used to evaluate cell viability, and cell apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay, after ibuprofen treatment. Skeletal muscle cell migration and spreading were evaluated using the transwell filter migration assay and F-actin staining, respectively. The protein expression of p130cas and CrkII, which are cell migration facilitating genes, was determined by western blot analysis. The overexpression of p130cas of muscle cells was achieved by p130cas vector transfection.<h4>Results</h4>The results demonstrated that ibuprofen did not have a significant negative effect on cell viability and apoptosis. Ibuprofen inhibited the migration and spreading of skeletal muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner. Ibuprofen also dose-dependently decreased the protein expression of p130cas and CrkII. Furthermore, overexpression of p130cas resulted in the promotion of cell migration and spreading and counteracted ibuprofen-mediated inhibition.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggested that ibuprofen exerts a potentially adverse effect on the migration of skeletal muscle cells by downregulating protein expression of p130cas and CrkII.

Conjugation is the most well characterized pathway for the spread of antibiotic resistance, compared to transformation and transduction. While antibiotics have been found to induce HGT, it remains unknown whether non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals can facilitate conjugation at a microbial community-wide level.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we demonstrate that several commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (including carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen and propranolol), at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.5 mg/L), can promote the conjugative transfer of IncP1-α plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance across entire microbial communities. The over-generation of reactive oxygen species in response to these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals may contribute to the enhanced conjugation ratios. Cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses indicated that non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals modulate transconjugant microbial communities at both phylum and genus levels. Moreover, microbial uptake ability of the IncP1-α plasmid was also upregulated under non-antibiotic pharmaceutical exposure. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Acinetobacter and Legionella, were more likely to acquire the plasmid conferring multidrug resistance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Considering the high possibility of co-occurrence of pathogenic bacteria, conjugative IncP1-α plasmids and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in various environments (e.g., activated sludge systems), our findings illustrate the potential risk associated with increased dissemination of antibiotic resistance promoted by non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in complex environmental settings.

Through rodent modeling, the poor prognosis of PPBC has been attributed to physiologic mammary gland involution, which shapes a tumor promotional microenvironment through induction of wound-healing-like programs including myeloid cell recruitment. Previous studies utilizing immune compromised mice have shown that blocking prostaglandin synthesis reduces PPBC tumor progression in a tumor cell extrinsic manner. Given the reported roles of prostaglandins in myeloid and T cell biology, and the established importance of these immune cell populations in dictating tumor growth, we investigate the impact of involution on shaping the tumor immune milieu and its mitigation by ibuprofen in immune competent hosts.<h4>Methods</h4>In a syngeneic (D2A1) orthotopic Balb/c mouse model of PPBC, we characterized the impact of mammary gland involution and ibuprofen treatment on the immune milieu in tumors and draining lymph nodes utilizing flow cytometry, multiplex IHC, lipid mass spectroscopy and cytokine arrays. To further investigate the impact of ibuprofen on programming myeloid cell populations, we performed RNA-Seq on in vivo derived mammary myeloid cells from ibuprofen treated and untreated involution group mice. Further, we examined direct effects of ibuprofen through in vitro bone marrow derived myeloid cell cultures.<h4>Results</h4>Tumors implanted into the mammary involution microenvironment grow more rapidly and display a distinct immune milieu compared to tumors implanted into glands of nulliparous mice. This milieu is characterized by increased presence of immature monocytes and reduced numbers of T cells and is reversed upon ibuprofen treatment. Further, ibuprofen treatment enhances Th1 associated cytokines as well as promotes tumor border accumulation of T cells. Safety studies demonstrate ibuprofen does not impede gland involution, impact subsequent reproductive success, nor promote auto-reactivity as detected through auto-antibody and naïve T cell priming assays.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen administration during the tumor promotional microenvironment of the involuting mammary gland reduces overall tumor growth and enhances anti-tumor immune characteristics while avoiding adverse autoimmune reactions. In sum, these studies implicate beneficial prophylactic use of ibuprofen during the pro-tumorigenic window of mammary gland involution.",2018,,"Pennock ND, Martinson HA, Guo Q, Betts CB, Jindal S, Tsujikawa T, Coussens LM, Borges VF, Schedin P.",https://jitc.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40425-018-0406-y,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

All subjects received a single dose of medication 1 h prior to separator placement. Using visual analog scale, patients recorded their pain perception during rest, fitting posterior teeth together, and chewing at time intervals of immediately, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h after separator placement.<h4>Results</h4>There was no significant difference between acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and meloxicam in post-separator placement pain control when administered 1 h before the procedure. In all the groups, at rest, pain level elevated after separator placement and reached its peak at 24 h and then subsided until 48 h. But during chewing and fitting of the posterior teeth, some of the groups reached a peak in pain at 48 h. No significant difference was found in pain experience between males and females.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Meloxicam can be used as an effective analgesic in orthodontic pain control considering it has less gastric side effects compared to the conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, IRCT2015041821828N1.",2015,,"Zarif Najafi H, Oshagh M, Salehi P, Babanouri N, Torkan S.",https://progressinorthodontics.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40510-015-0104-y,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study examined the safety and efficacy of ibuprofen gargle in healthy volunteers and patients with chemotherapy- and concomitant CRT-induced oral mucositis.<h4>Methods</h4>We enrolled healthy volunteers and patients with chemotherapy- and CRT-induced oral mucositis. In cohort I, single and multiple doses of ibuprofen gargle (0.6% or 1.0%) were administered to healthy volunteers on day 1 and days 4-10. In cohort II, multiple doses of ibuprofen gargle (0.6%) were administered to patients with complicated grade 2-3 oral mucositis based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The primary endpoint of cohort I was the treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) as defined by CTCAE version 4.0. The primary endpoint of cohort II was the change in the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score from before to 15 min after gargle use on day 3. The incidence and severity of TRAEs were assessed based on the CTCAE version 4.0 and a subjective rating scale completed by healthy volunteers and patients.<h4>Results</h4>In cohort I, 9 of 10 healthy volunteers were evaluable for safety. All 9 healthy volunteers reported the TRAE of oral irritation with single or multiple use of the gargle. In cohort II, 10 patients were enrolled and evaluable for safety and 7 of 10 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The mean change in the VAS pain score from before to 15 min after using the gargle on day 3 was - 1.28 (95% confidence interval: - 2.06, - 0.51), and all patients experienced some degree of pain relief (range: - 0.2 to - 2.5). All 10 patients reported the TRAE of oral irritation. No other TRAEs of ibuprofen gargle were observed in the healthy volunteers and patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite oral irritation, the ibuprofen gargle appeared to be safe and effective for the pain related to chemo- or CRT-induced oral mucositis.

In many parts of the world, NSAIDs can be purchased over-the-counter and used without any physician oversight. However, the chronic nature of overuse injuries requires NSAIDs to be taken orally for an extended period of time. As a result, they can have significant adverse effects on athletes, namely gastrointestinal (GI), renal, and cardiovascular damage. Dyspepsia and upper GI ulceration and bleeding are of great concern in chronic NSAID use, and as such oral NSAIDs are generally contraindicated in those with a history of peptic ulcers or irritable bowel disease. In the setting of chronic overuse soft tissue or joint disease, topically administered NSAIDs offer an alternate route of administration that has the potential to deliver a similar level of pain and anti-inflammatory relief while bypassing the harmful side effects associated with oral intake. Topically applied NSAIDs are able to achieve high concentrations within the targeted site of action while simultaneously keeping plasma concentrations low, offering several advantages over oral administration. One commonly used generic NSAID is ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid). First synthesized in the 1960s, ibuprofen has since become widely available as an over-the-counter pharmaceutical.

CDI is treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Rarely reported in the literature, opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) can induce hyponatremia in individuals treated for CDI.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 10-year-old boy with septo-optic dysplasia and CDI was treated with DDAVP 1.6 mg orally TID maintaining normal sodium levels. Post admission for a femur fracture, he was discharged on ibuprofen and hydromorphone. Sodium was 136 mmol/l two days before discharge. He returned to the ED after having a seizure at home. He was euvolemic and mildly lethargic. Sodium was low at 108 mmol/l. DDAVP and hydromorphone were held and he was fluid restricted, but the sodium remained low. Sodium began to rise when Ibuprofen was stopped. Intermittent small doses of DDAVP were given to facilitate gradual correction of hyponatremia. At discharge, sodium had normalized.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Hyponatremia has occasionally been described as a side effect of opioids and rarely of NSAIDs in patients with CDI.

The elderly are at significant risk for developing pulmonary disorders and infectious diseases, but the contribution of inflammation in the pulmonary environment has received little attention. In this study, we demonstrate that the lungs of old mice have elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and a resident population of highly activated pulmonary macrophages that are refractory to further activation by IFN-γ. The impact of this inflammatory state on macrophage function was determined in vitro in response to infection with M.tb. Macrophages from the lungs of old mice secreted more proinflammatory cytokines in response to M.tb infection than similar cells from young mice and also demonstrated enhanced M.tb uptake and P-L fusion.

Current pharmacovigilance systems still have substantial limitations, however. The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP), the comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR), and association statistics for pharmacovigilance purposes. DESIGN Narrative discharge summaries were collected from the Clinical Information System at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). MedLEE, an NLP system, was applied to the collection to identify medication events and entities which could be potential adverse drug events (ADEs). Co-occurrence statistics with adjusted volume tests were used to detect associations between the two types of entities, to calculate the strengths of the associations, and to determine their cutoff thresholds. Seven drugs/drug classes (ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion, paroxetine, rosiglitazone, ACE inhibitors) with known ADEs were selected to evaluate the system. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two potential ADEs were found to be associated with the 7 drugs. Overall recall and precision were 0.75 and 0.31 for known ADEs respectively. Importantly, qualitative evaluation using historic roll back design suggested that novel ADEs could be detected using our system. CONCLUSIONS This study provides a framework for the development of active, high-throughput and prospective systems which could potentially unveil drug safety profiles throughout their entire market life. Our results demonstrate that the framework is feasible although there are some challenging issues.

Herein, we used a large prospective cohort study to examine these associations.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>In total, 64,839 men and women age 50 to 76 years were recruited from 2000 to 2002 to the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) study. Incident hematologic malignancies (n = 577) were identified through December 2008 by linkage to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with use of analgesics for total incident hematologic malignancies and cancer subcategories were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, self-rated health, arthritis, chronic musculoskeletal pain, migraines, headaches, fatigue, and family history of leukemia/lymphoma.<h4>Results</h4>After adjustment, there was an increased risk of incident hematologic malignancies associated with high use (≥ 4 days/week for ≥ 4 years) of acetaminophen (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.50 for high use; P trend = .004). This association was seen for myeloid neoplasms (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.12), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.93), and plasma cell disorders (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.08 to 5.41), but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.31 to 2.28). By comparison, there was no association with risk of incident hematologic malignancies for increasing use of aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs, or ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>High use of acetaminophen was associated with an almost two-fold increased risk of incident hematologic malignancies other than CLL/SLL.

The influence of storage time at 23 degrees C and 60 degrees C on the release of ibuprofen from coated beads was also investigated. The thermal properties of the films were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to image the surface morphology of the coated beads. Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of Eudragit RS 30 D and ibuprofen. Results from the dissolution studies demonstrated that increasing the amount of ibuprofen in the polymeric film reduced the rate of drug release, mainly because of a more complete coalescence of the polymeric particles of the latex dispersion. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of Eudragit RS 30 D films decreased and the surface of the coated beads became smoother as the concentration of ibuprofen was increased. Hydrogen bonding between the polymer and ibuprofen was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. No significant differences were found in drug dissolution between the coated beads stored at 23 degrees C for 12 months and those stored at 60 degrees C for 12 hours.

Both transport a variety of monocarboxylates in a Na(+)-coupled manner. They are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, thyroid, brain, and retina. SLC5A8 is localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to neurons and the retinal pigment epithelium. The physiologic functions of SLC5A8 include absorption of short-chain fatty acids in the colon and small intestine, reabsorption of lactate and pyruvate in the kidney, and cellular uptake of lactate and ketone bodies in neurons. It also transports the B-complex vitamin nicotinate. SLC5A12 is also localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to astrocytes and Müller cells. SLC5A8 also functions as a tumor suppressor; its expression is silenced in tumors of colon, thyroid, stomach, kidney, and brain. The tumor-suppressive function is related to its ability to mediate concentrative uptake of butyrate, propionate, and pyruvate, all of which are inhibitors of histone deacetylases. SLC5A8 can also transport a variety of pharmacologically relevant monocarboxylates, including salicylates, benzoate, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and fenoprofen, also interact with SLC5A8.

Increased curing times resulted in decreased drug release rates from Eudragit NE-coated beads. However, an increase in drug release rates was noticed at longer curing times and higher temperatures for the Eudragit RS coating system. The surface morphological changes of the film-coated beads revealed that there were no visible macroscopic changes as a result of curing. The absence of any ibuprofen melting peak in the DSC thermograms of cured NE and RS coated beads confirmed that there was no surface crystallization of ibuprofen. These results indicated that the increase in drug release rates from RS coated pellets, when subjected to long curing times, resulted from loss of plasticizer. Free films of Eudragit NE exhibited an increase in tensile strength with increased curing times, whereas Eudragit RS free films showed a decrease in tensile strength beyond 4 h of curing at 70 and 90 degrees C. The film thicknesses and weights of free films of Eudragit RS prepared with triethyl citrate plasticizer were found to change more dramatically with curing than did free films of Eudragit RS prepared with ibuprofen as the plasticizer.

The dissolution study of sustained release layer showed that an increasing amount of HPMC or PVP K(30) results in reduced IB release. The inclusion of buffer (sodium bicarbonate) enhanced the release of IB from sustained release layer. The rational for formulation of bi-layer tablet of these two drugs in combination was (1) MTH increases the absorption of acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) by increasing gastric motility. So sequential release of MTH (as immediate release) and IB (as sustained release) was suitable for treatment of migraine. (2) MTH was degraded when prolonged contact with acidic NSAID.

Ibuprofen was used as a representative drug for anhydride derivatization. Conjugates of ibuprofen with carboxylic acid moieties of different acrylic polymers were prepared by dehydration reaction using acetic anhydride. Products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy followed by preparation of microspheres with different sizes from the conjugate Eudragit L-100-ibuprofen. The drug release was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ibuprofen was bound to the polymers via an anhydride bond in high reaction yields (75-95%) with drug loading of up to 30% (w/w).

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of a series of lactate esters as penetration enhancers on the in vitro skin permeation of four drugs with different physicochemical properties, including ibuprofen, salicylic acid, dexamethasone and 5-fluorouracil. The saturated donor solutions of the evaluated drugs in propylene glycol were used in order to keep a constant driving force with maximum thermodynamic activity. The permeability coefficient (K(p)), skin concentration of drugs (SC), and lag time (T), as well as the enhancement ratios for K(p) and SC were recorded. All results indicated that lactate esters can exert a significant influence on the transdermal delivery of the model drugs and there is a structure-activity relationship between the tested lactate esters and their enhancement effects. The results also suggested that the lactate esters with the chain length of fatty alcohol moieties of 10-12 are more effective enhancers. Furthermore, the enhancement effect of lactate esters increases with a decrease of the drug lipophilicity, which suggests that they may be more efficient at enhancing the penetration of hydrophilic drugs than lipophilic drugs. The influence of the concentration of lactate esters was evaluated and the optimal concentration is in the range of 5-10 wt.%. In sum, lactate esters as a penetration enhancer for some drugs are of interest for transdermal administration when the safety of penetration enhancers is a prime consideration.",2010,,"Zhang J, Liu M, Jin H, Deng L, Xing J, Dong A.",https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-010-9449-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Unfortunately, this type of testing often yields permeation data that suffer from poor reproducibility. Moreover, this feature frequently occurs when synthetic membranes are used as barriers, in which case biological tissue-associated variability has been removed as an artefact of total variation. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the influence of a full-validation protocol on the performance of a tailor-made array of Franz diffusion cells (GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, UK) available in our laboratory. To this end, ibuprofen was used as a model hydrophobic drug while synthetic membranes were used as barriers. The parameters investigated included Franz cell dimensions, stirring conditions, membrane type, membrane treatment, temperature regulation and sampling frequency. It was determined that validation dramatically reduced derived data variability as the coefficient of variation for steady-state ibuprofen permeation from a gel formulation was reduced from 25.7% to 5.3% (n = 6). Thus, validation and refinement of the protocol combined with improved operator training can greatly enhance reproducibility in Franz cell experimentation.",2010,,"Ng SF, Rouse JJ, Sanderson FD, Meidan V, Eccleston GM.",https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-010-9522-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

With zein/ibuprofen (IBU) co-dissolving solution and N, N-dimethylformamide as core and sheath fluids, respectively, the drug-loaded zein fibers could be generated continuously and smoothly without any clogging of the spinneret. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrated that the fibers had ribbon morphology with a smooth surface. Their average diameters were 0.94±0.34 and 0.67±0.21 μm when the sheath-to-core flow rate ratios were taken as 0.11 and 0.25, respectively. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry verified that IBU was in an amorphous state in all fiber composites. Fourier transform infrared spectra showed that zein had good compatibility with IBU owing to hydrogen bonding. In vitro dissolution tests showed that all the fibers could provide sustained drug release files via a typical Fickian diffusion mechanism.

Several attempts have been reported to improve the permeability of poorly soluble drug compounds using supersaturated systems. However, due to thermodynamic challenges, there was a high tendency for the drug to nucleate immediately after formulating or even during storage. The present study focuses on the efficiency of nanoparticles and influence of different concentrations of solubilizer such as vitamin E TPGS (D-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) to improve the permeation rate through the skin. Effects of several formulation factors were studied on the nanosuspension systems using ibuprofen as a model drug.

Unfortunately, the acidic nature of ibuprofen minimizes the amount of drug that can be solubilized under gastric conditions and would be available for immediate absorption upon entry into the intestine. Although the sodium salt of ibuprofen has higher solubility, rapid conversion from the salt to the poorly soluble free acid phase occurs under gastric conditions. Therefore, the combination of the highly soluble sodium salt form of ibuprofen with polymers was evaluated as an approach to prolong supersaturation of ibuprofen during the disproportionation of the salt. Binary combinations of ibuprofen sodium with polymers resulted in the identification of several formulations that demonstrated high degrees and extended durations of supersaturation during in vitro dissolution experiments. These formulations included HPMC, polyvinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVP-VA64), methylcellulose (MC), and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). The in vitro supersaturation observed with these ibuprofen-polymer formulations translated to an increase in Cmax and an earlier Tmax for the PVP-VA64, MC, and HPC formulations relative to ibuprofen only controls when administered orally to rats under fasted conditions. Based on these observations, combining ibuprofen sodium with polymers such as PVP-VA64, MC, or HPC is a viable formulation approach to prolong supersaturation in the stomach and enable an optimized pharmacokinetic profile in vivo where rapid onset of action is desired.",2014,,"Terebetski JL, Cummings JJ, Fauty SE, Michniak-Kohn B.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4179647?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Five organic acids with different physicochemical properties, benzoic acid (BA), ibuprofen (IB), salicylic acid (SA), benzenesulfonic acid (BSA), and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), were employed as counter-ions to regulate the permeation rate of ESP across the rabbit abdominal skin in vitro. The interaction between ESP and organic acids was characterized by FTIR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy. Results showed that all organic acids investigated in this study performed a controlling effect on ESP flux. To further analyze the factors concerned with the permeation capability of ESP-acid complex, a multiple linear regression model was used. It is concluded that the steady-state flux (J) of ESP-acid complexes had a positive correlation with log K <sub>o/w</sub> (the n-octanol/water partition coefficient of ion-pair complex) and pK <sub>a</sub> (the acidity of organic acid counter-ion), but a negative correlation with MW (the molecular weight of ion-pair complex).

Ketoprofen (KTP) and ibuprofen (IBU) were used as two separate model drugs. Eudragit S100 (ES100) was the matrix-forming agent, and ethyl cellulose (EC) (2.5 and 5%) was the release-retarding agent. A 16-mm extruder was used to develop the CTDDS to pilot scale. The obtained extrudate strands were transparent, indicating that the drugs were homogeneously dispersed in the matrix in an amorphous form, confirmed by both differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. The strands were pelletized into 1, 2, and 3 mm size pellets. A 100% drug release from 1, 2, and 3 mm pellets with 2.5% EC was observed at 12, 14, and 16 h, whereas the drug release was sustained for 14, 16, and 22 h from 5% EC pellets, respectively, for KTP.

Therefore, the in vitro permeation of excised porcine ear skin by drugs with different polarities [aminopyrine (AMP), antipyrine (ANP), methylparaben (MP), and ibuprofen (IP)] was analyzed under a constant skin surface temperature with different temperatures and humidities to reveal the effects of temperature and humidity on the skin permeation enhancement effects. Applied formulations were prepared by mixing the drug and a hydrophilic vehicle containing glycerin. The disposition-distance profiles of water and the humectant glycerin in the stratum corneum were also investigated using confocal Raman microscopy. High absolute humidity (AH) significantly contributed to the high skin penetration of the hydrophilic penetrants AMP, ANP, and MP but not the hydrophobic penetrant IP. An increase in the partition parameter and a decrease in the diffusivity parameter occurred with an increase in AH, independent of drug polarity. Moreover, we found that dew condensation induced by high AH on temperature-controlled skin surface may effectively increase water content and may provide higher glycerin distribution in the skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Increasing the amount of water and hydrophilic vehicles such as glycerin in the stratum corneum may enhance the permeation of hydrophilic penetrants AMP, ANP, and MP.

NEs were prepared by the spontaneous emulsification method and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The composition of the optimal formulation was statistically optimized using Box-Behnken experimental design method with three independent factors and was characterized for particle size, polydispersity index, and percent transmittance. The selected formula was tested for its in vitro antioxidant activity and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. The optimized HNa-Ind NE formula was characterized and displayed a particle size of 12.87 ± 0.032 nm, polydispersity index of 0.606 ± 0.082, and 99.4 ± 0.1 percentage of transmittance. FTIR showed no interaction between HNa and Ind as a physical mixture. In addition, the optimized HNa-Ind NE was able to preserve the antioxidant ability of the two drugs, as evidenced through a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition assay used to assess free radical scavenging ability. The cell viability was increased while the free radical scavenging activity was decreased (94.28% inhibition at higher concentrations compared with vitamin C as a reference with an inhibition of 100%). Moreover, the pharmacological anti-inflammatory potential of the optimized HNa-Ind NE formulation was assessed using an in vivo model. Compared with reference drugs (ibuprofen gel 5%), the remarkable activity of the optimized formulation was established using xylene-induced ear edema in mice model, in which the inflamed region reduced by 92.5% upon treatment.

Ibuprofen is a commonly used anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic drug; however, because of its short biological half-life, it must be frequently administered orally and is highly irritating to the digestive tract. To prepare a novel transdermal delivery system for ibuprofen, a microemulsion was used as a drug carrier and dispersed in a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (ME/Gel) to increase percutaneous drug absorption while avoiding gastrointestinal tract irritation. The prepared microemulsion had a droplet size of ~ 90 nm, and the microemulsion had good stability in the hydrogel. Rheological tests revealed that the ME/Gel is a pseudoplastic fluid with decreased viscosity and increased shear rate. It displayed a certain viscoelasticity, and the microemulsion distribution displayed minor effects on the rheological characteristics of the hydrogel system. There was no significant difference in the rheology of the ME/Gel at 25°C and 32°C (normal skin surface temperature), which is beneficial for clinical application. Drug transdermal flux was significantly higher than that of the hydrogel and commercial cream groups (p < 0.01). The 24-h cumulative drug permeation amount was 1.42-fold and 2.52-fold higher than that of the hydrogel and cream groups, respectively.

The vitro study of transdermal absorption of lidocaine in DESs showed that the cumulative amounts of lidocaine reached 252.4 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>, 226.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and 286.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> at 8 h for DESs with 45%, 50%, and 60% of water, respectively. The permeation mechanism of DES with lower content of water (45%) was mainly by changing the fluidization of lipids, while changing the secondary structure of keratin in stratum corneum (SC) at higher water content (50% and 60%). These nonirritant and viscous fluid like DESs with good drug solubility and permeation enhancing effects have broad application prospect in the field of drug solubilization and transdermal drug delivery system.",2023,,"Lv J, Wu P, Fang Y, Zhang W, Liu D, Wu M, Shang L, Li H, Zhao Y.",https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-023-02638-0,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The low solubility of ibuprofen is advantageous for forming a gel when exposed to an aqueous phase. The 1% w/w fluconazole-loaded in situ gel oral sprays were developed utilizing various concentrations of ibuprofen in N-methyl pyrrolidone. The prepared solutions underwent evaluation for viscosity, surface tension, contact angle, water tolerance, gel formation, interface interaction, drug permeation, and antimicrobial studies. The higher amount of ibuprofen reduced the surface tension and retarded solvent exchange. The use of 50% ibuprofen as a gelling agent demonstrated prolonged drug permeation for up to 24 h. The incorporation of Cremophor EL in the formulations resulted in increased drug permeation and exhibited effective inhibition against Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida tropicalis. While the Cremophor EL-loaded formulation did not exhibit enhanced antifungal effects on agar media, its ability to facilitate the permeation of fluconazole and ibuprofen suggested potential efficacy in countering Candida invasion in the oral mucosa. Moreover, these formulations demonstrated significant thermal inhibition of protein denaturation in egg albumin, indicating anti-inflammatory properties. Consequently, the fluconazole-loaded ibuprofen in situ gel-based oral spray presents itself as a promising dosage form for oropharyngeal candidiasis treatment.",2024,,"Khaing EM, Senarat S, Jitrangsri K, Phaechamud T.",https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-024-02804-y,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The aim of this study to develop emulgel and nanostructured lipid carrier NLC-based gel formulations containing ibuprofen, evaluate their mechanical properties, bioadhesive value and ex-vivo rabbit skin permeability. All formulations showed non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior and their viscosity values are suitable for topical application. The particle size of the nanostructured lipid carrier system was found to be 468 ± 21 nm, and the encapsulation efficiency was 95.58 ± 0.41%. According to the index of viscosity, consistency, firmness, and cohesiveness values obtained as a result of the back extrusion study, E2 formulation was found to be more suitable for transdermal application. The firmness and work of shear values of the E2 formulation, which has the highest viscosity value, were also found to be the highest and it was chosen as the most suitable formulation in terms of the spreadability test. The work of bioadhesion values of NLC-based gel and IBU-loaded NLC-based gel were found as 0.226 ± 0.028 and 0.181 ± 0.006 mJ/cm2 respectively.

These pathological markers can contribute to the loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain. Interestingly, men have a 2-fold increased incidence for Parkinson's disease than women. Although the mechanisms underlying this sex difference remain elusive, we propose that the primary male sex hormone, testosterone, is involved. Our previous studies show that testosterone, through a putative membrane androgen receptor, can increase oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity in dopamine neurons. Based on these results, this study examines the role of nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and apoptosis in the deleterious effects of androgens in an oxidative stress environment. We hypothesize, under oxidative stress environment, testosterone via a putative membrane androgen receptor will exacerbate oxidative stress-induced NF-κB/COX2 signaling in N27 dopaminergic neurons, leading to apoptosis. Our data show that testosterone increased the expression of COX2 and apoptosis in dopamine neurons. Inhibiting the NF-κB and COX2 pathway with CAPE and ibuprofen, respectively, blocked testosterone's negative effects on cell viability, indicating that NF-κB/COX2 cascade plays a role in the negative interaction between testosterone and oxidative stress on neuroinflammation. These data further support the role of testosterone mediating the loss of dopamine neurons under oxidative stress conditions, which may be a key mechanism contributing to the increased incidence of Parkinson's disease in men compared with women.",2016,,"Holmes S, Singh M, Su C, Cunningham RL.",https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2015-1738,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The solubility of ibuprofen sodium was determined at a range of pH values. Saturated solutions were then used to determine the influence of pH on diffusion across PDMS as a model membrane. The apparent partition coefficient of ibuprofen sodium between n-octanol and phosphate buffer at various pH values was also investigated. Organic salts of ibuprofen using ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine and ethylene diamine as counter-ions were synthesized and the influence of these counter-ions on the permeation of ibuprofen was studied. The presence of ion-pairing was confirmed using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Diffusion studies at different pH values (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0) indicated that ibuprofen sodium flux increased significantly with increasing pH from 4.0 to 7.0. Above pH 7.0 a decrease in diffusion was observed. The permeability coefficient increased with an increase in the amount of unionized acid. The apparent partition coefficient was directly related to the steady-state flux. The steady-state flux of ibuprofen increased up to 16-fold using different counter-ions. The highest flux was measured from ibuprofen triethylamine. The flux of ibuprofen salts across a lipophilic membrane can be increased by formation of ion-pairs.

After Food and Drug Administration approval of erenumab, both patients started subcutaneous erenumab monthly as allowed per protocol.<h4>Results</h4>Patients were women 44 and 36 years of age with ≥2 decades of self-reported suboptimal response to multiple migraine medications. Patient 1 used rimegepant for 6 months and then started erenumab 70 mg subcutaneous monthly. Despite a response to preventive treatment with erenumab, she experienced substantial relief treating 7 of 7 acute attacks with rimegepant and eliminated regular, frequent use of ibuprofen and a caffeinated analgesic. Patient 2 used rimegepant for 60 days before starting erenumab 140 mg subcutaneously monthly. While on erenumab, 9 of 9 attacks treated with rimegepant responded. She stopped near-daily use of injectable ketorolac and diphenhydramine. While using rimegepant alone or together with erenumab, patients reported no related adverse events.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Rimegepant 75 mg may be effective for acute treatment during concomitant erenumab preventive administration. The mechanism underlying the benefits of concomitant use of a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist and an anti-CGRP receptor antibody is unknown and requires further study.<h4>Clinicaltrialsgov identifier</h4>NCT03266588.<h4>Classification of evidence</h4>This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with migraine using erenumab, rimegepant is effective for acute treatment.",2020,,"Mullin K, Kudrow D, Croop R, Lovegren M, Conway CM, Coric V, Lipton RB.",https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000008944,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The in vitro and in vivo skin permeability of tegafur, alclofenac and ibuprofen was enhanced by the use of ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) or ethanol/water (60/40) binary vehicles as a donor composition. However, the two vehicles showed contrastive properties in relation to the extent of permeation enhancement of the three drugs: tegafur > alclofenac > ibuprofen for the ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) system, and ibuprofen > or = alclofenac > tegafur for the ethanol/water (60/40) system. When lauric acid, as a permeation enhancer, was added to both of the binary vehicles, the in vitro and in vivo skin permeability of three drugs further increased, and the in vivo absorption rate of the drugs from the ethanol/water (60/40) system was larger than that from the ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) system. In conclusion, it was suggested that the ethanol/panasate 800 (40/60) lipophilic binary vehicle is useful for hydrophilic drugs, and conversely, the skin absorption of lipophilic drugs can be improved by the use of the ethanol/water (60/40) hydrophilic binary vehicle with or without lauric acid as a permeation enhancer.",1993,,"Lee CK, Uchida T, Kitagawa K, Yagi A, Kim NS, Goto S.",https://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.16.1264,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The permeability of all drugs was remarkably increased by the treatment of skin with EtOH/Panasate 800 binary systems compared with either EtOH or Panasate 800 alone, and the effect reached a maximum in EtOH/Panasate 800 (40/60) system. With regard to this binary system, the skin permeation ratio or flux of the drug increased in the following order: salicyluric acid (SU) > salicylic acid (SA) > alclofenac (ALC) > ketoprofen (KP) > ibuprofen (IBU). The one-layer skin model was applied concerning the above skin permeation profiles of the five drugs. Diffusion parameter (D'), partition parameter (K'), and permeation constant (Kp = D' x K') were calculated using the Laplace-transformed equations with the aid of MULTI (FILT). It was well demonstrated that the reduction of lag time and the increase of flux caused by EtOH/Panasate 800 binary vehicle systems was due to an increase of D' value by Panasate 800 and K' value by EtOH, respectively, in the skin. Especially, the EtOH/Panasate 800 (40/60) binary vehicle system produced the largest Kp value in each drug.

Five-month-old YMP skin showed small variation with respect to drug permeation rates, if the region of skin site was the same. But skin from 6-month-old YMPs showed faster and varied permeation rates due to skin defects. In the case of hydrophilic drugs, no effects on permeation due to the region from which the skin was obtained were observed, although higher permeation rates were observed through the flank than through dorsal skin in the case of ibuprofen and ketoprofen. For YMP skin, the permeation coefficients of drugs were lower than those for hairless rat skin, especially for hydrophilic drugs. Compared with reported human data on permeation coefficients, the permeation coefficients of drugs through YMP skin were 1/2-1/8 of those through human skin, regardless of whether the drugs were hydrophilic or lipophilic.

High encapsulation efficiency and release control of drugs are essential for clinical application of liposomes. For efficient drug loading into liposomes, remote loading method using driving force like transmembrane gradients of pH and ions are utilized. Ions are called as ""trapping agents,"" which are also critical for the controlled release of drugs loaded into liposomes inside. It is difficult to apply ions as trapping agents to various drugs because of limited physicochemical compatibility between drugs and ions. Cyclodextrins (CDs) with hydrophobic cavity can make inclusion complexes with various hydrophobic compounds. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the potential of CDs as a novel trapping agent using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) and ibuprofen (IB), a weak acid hydrophobic drug. Encapsulation efficiency of IB in liposomes with pH gradient was approximately 27%, and it was enhanced by intraliposomal SBE-β-CD inclusion in addition to pH gradient, which was SBE-β-CD concentration-dependent. In liposomes with pH gradient, a large fraction of IB was released in a short time. This early-stage rapid IB release was significantly suppressed by the inclusion of SBE-β-CD inside liposomes. Thus, novel remote loading technology by intraliposomal SBE-β-CD enabled the efficient encapsulation of the hydrophobic drug into the aqueous phase of liposomes as well as their controlled release.

Three kinds of drugs, indomethacin, ibuprofen and sulfanilamide which have similar solubilities in a mixed organic solvent (ethanol-diethylcarbitol, 40:60 v/v), were selected to evaluate the drug penetration with or without 5% AZ. Transdermal delivery rates were determined at 27 and 37 degrees C by using an in vitro diffusion cell procedure and the abdominal full-thickness skin of hairless rat. The solubility of each of the three drugs in the solvent with AZ was similar to that without AZ. Ethanol in the vehicle penetrated through the skin prior to the drugs. Activation energies for the skin penetration of the three drugs in the presence of AZ were decreased compared to those in its absence. For all drugs the partition coefficients between the skin and vehicle with AZ were 2-80 times higher than those without it. The activity coefficients of drugs in the presence of AZ in the skin were 2-90 times lower than those without the enhancer.

Liquid paraffin (LP) was used as the oil, and indomethacin (IM), ketoprofen (KP), flurbiprofen (FP) and ibuprofen (IP) were used as model drugs. IM did not dissolve in LP, but solubilized when heated with HSL at a concentration of about 1% with 15% HSL at 95 degrees C. IM gel was thus prepared as follows: IM and HSL were mixed, added into LP, capped tightly, heated in a water bath and cooled. The consistency of the gel increased with increasing IM concentration, indicating some kind of interaction between IM and HSL. The release of IM from the IM gel was faster than that from a preparation in which IM was mixed in gel at room temperature (Gel + IM). The release rate of IM from IM gel was proportional to IM concentrations up to 1%, but became constant above that. Permeation of IM through hairless rat abdominal skin from IM gel was higher than that from the Gel + IM. The permeation rate was proportional to IM concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 0.5% in 15% HSL gel. KP and FP also solubilized in gel when subjected to the same procedure as IM, and their release and permeation increased when they were formulated as gels. However, no evident improvement of permeation was observed in the case of IP, which had high LP solubility. It was suggested that HSL showed no enhancing effect, but solubilized IM, KP or FP, leading to high permeation from the gel. After 3 months' storage, the permeation rate did not change for 0.5% IM in 15% HSL gel, but decreased for 1% IM in 15% HSL gel.

We determined the permeation of both compounds from the IL through a silicone membrane selected as a model biological membrane, and mathematically analyzed the permeation data from the viewpoint of the thermodynamic activities of lidocaine, ibuprofen, and the IL. As a result, IL and ibuprofen diffusely permeated through the membrane in the case of applying IL preparations with a molar fraction of ibuprofen of 0.5 or higher. The IL was thought to separate into lidocaine and ibuprofen in the receiver. On the other hand, when applying IL preparations with a molar fraction of lidocaine of 0.5 or higher, IL and lidocaine permeated. The permeation rate of IL itself was maximized when the applied IL was prepared using equimolar amounts of lidocaine and ibuprofen, and it decreased when the fraction of lidocaine or ibuprofen increased by more than 0.5.

It was found in the test of rat edema induced by various phlogists that carrageenin and yeast-induced edemas were markedly inhibited by FP-70, whereas dextran, formalin, serotonin and bradykinin-induced edemas were scarcely inhibited by FP-70. The action of FP-70 was similar to that of soy bean trypsin inhibitor. However, FP-70 showed no effects on kinin synthetase and kininase. FP-70 showed a marked inhibition on prostaglandin synthesis. The inhibitory effect of FP-70 was 10.1, 96.5 and 2280.6 times as large as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid, respectively. FP-70 did not inhibit the permeability of dye induced by prostaglandin E2 in the rat skin. FP-70 inhibited the acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase activities of isolated lysosome of rat liver and also suppressed the release of acid phosphatase from the lysosome. These effects were similar to those of indomethacin. On the other hand, FP-70 suppressed markedly the heat-induced hemolysis of dog erythrocytes. The effect was similar to that of indomethacin and was 10 times stronger than those of ibuprofen, ibufenac and phenylbutazone. Activation of rat liver mitochondrial ATPase by FP-70 at a concentration of 10 muM was 74.7%, while indomethacin showed 37.8% activation at the same concentration. FP-70 as well as ibuprofen and phenylbutazone uncoupled the oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria. From the above and previously reported results, it is suggested that the potent anti-inflammatory action of FP-70 is the result of the following effects; inhibition on the protein and leucocyte migration, inhibition on the prostaglandin synthesis, stabilization of the cell membrane and activation of ATPase.",1976,,"Masumoto S, Masuda C.",https://doi.org/10.1254/fpj.72.753,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

TAI-284 inhibited the heat denaturation of bovine serum albumin at pH 5.3, similar to that seen with IMC and weaker than that seen with phenylbutazone. TAI-284 prevented the rat erythrocyte from heat-induced hemolysis and was twice as potent as IMC. TAI-284 produced alterations in platelet function as characterized by loss of secondary aggregation in response to ADP and inhibition of aggregation by collagen. Both these effects were one fifth as potent as those seen with IMC. In rats, platelet aggregation induced by collagen and secondary ADP aggregation was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by a single oral administration of TAI-284. The inhibitory activity was approximately one fourth that of IMC or twice that of IP in the former and in the latter one fifth that of IMC or similar as that of IP.

The aim of this study was to test whether celecoxib could inhibit the apoptosis of chondrocyte and ameliorate type II collagen synthesis to relieve symptoms of OA (osteoarthritis).<h4>Material/methods</h4>130 Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups as celecoxib (CE), ibuprofen (IBP), indomethacin (IN) and normal saline group (NS). The osteoarthritis was induced by the excision of the left Achilles tendon. At the 3th, 6th, 9th month of treatment, the histological structure of articular cartilage was observed using HE staining. Type II collagen was examined using immunohistochemistry. Chondrocyte apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining, and the change of ultra-microstructure of chondrocyte was examined through a transmission electron microscope.<h4>Results</h4>CE reduced the OA-like histological changes and suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis. However, IN or IBP had deleterious effects on articular cartilage and enhanced the chondrocyte apoptosis.

Mifamurtide's rational drug design employs MTP-PE for macrophage activation in a multilamellar liposome drug carrier, containing the synthetic phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidyl choline (POPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidyl serine (OOPS). Although the drug is not cytotoxic towards normal or tumor cells in vitro, immune activation against osteosarcoma lung metastases in vivo accounts for mifamurtide's antiosteosarcoma effects. Phosphatidyl serine-containing lipids signal macrophage cells that have ""flipped phosphatidyl serine"" to the outer membrane after apoptosis (e.g., after damage of tumor cells from chemotherapy); thus, both mifamurtide's active and inactive ingredients target immune cells in the lungs. Mifamurtide administration has resulted in 8% and 13% improvement in 6- and 5-year overall survivals, when added to chemotherapy in nonmetastatic and metastatic patients with osteosarcoma, respectively. The short-term toxicities of mifamurtide (fever, headache, flu-like symptoms and rigors) are reduced or eliminated using ibuprofen (200 mg) as premedication for the first infusion; an algorithm for pre- and postmedication is presented. To date, no long-term side effects of mifamurtide have been reported. Compassionate access programs based in two major cancer centers (MD Anderson and Memorial Sloan-Kettering), have recently provided this potentially life-saving drug in North America.

In the present study, isolated male and female CKO-cardiomyocytes exhibit increased prostaglandin (PG)-generating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The PG-degrading hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase-15 (HPGD) expression is only reduced in male cardiomyocytes, which is associated with increased prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) secretion from isolated male but not female CKO-cardiomyocytes. Reduced HPGD expression in male cardiomyocytes derive from impaired androgen receptor (AR)-signaling due to loss of its cofactor STAT3. Elevated PGD2 secretion in males is associated with increased white adipocyte accumulation in aged male but not female hearts. Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in isolated stem cell antigen-1 (SCA-1)+ cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) from young male CKO-mice compared with the adipocyte differentiation of male wild-type (WT)-CPC and CPC isolated from female mice. Epigenetic analysis in freshly isolated male CKO-CPC display hypermethylation in pro-angiogenic genes (Fgfr2, Epas1) and hypomethylation in the white adipocyte differentiation gene Zfp423 associated with up-regulated ZFP423 expression and a shift from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation compared with WT-CPC. The expression of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 is reduced in male CKO-CPC compared with male WT-CPC, whereas no differences in the EZH2 expression in female CPC were observed. Clonally expanded CPC can differentiate into endothelial cells or into adipocytes depending on the differentiation conditions. ZFP423 overexpression is sufficient to induce white adipocyte differentiation of clonal CPC. In isolated WT-CPC, PGD2 stimulation reduces the expression of EZH2, thereby up-regulating ZFP423 expression and promoting white adipocyte differentiation. The treatment of young male CKO mice with the COX inhibitor Ibuprofen or the PGD2 receptor (DP)2 receptor antagonist BAY-u 3405 in vivo increased EZH2 expression and reduced ZFP423 expression and adipocyte differentiation in CKO-CPC. Thus, cardiomyocyte STAT3 deficiency leads to age-related and sex-specific cardiac remodeling and failure in part due to sex-specific alterations in PGD2 secretion and subsequent epigenetic impairment of the differentiation potential of CPC. Causally involved is the impaired AR signaling in absence of STAT3, which reduces the expression of the PG-degrading enzyme HPGD.",2020,,"Stelling E, Ricke-Hoch M, Erschow S, Hoffmann S, Bergmann AK, Heimerl M, Pietzsch S, Battmer K, Haase A, Stapel B, Scherr M, Balligand JL, Binah O, Hilfiker-Kleiner D.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000739,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Drug disposition into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is also subject to age-related variation and can be further influenced by brain diseases affecting blood-brain barrier integrity, like meningitis. Here, we developed a generic pediatric brain PBPK model to predict CSF concentrations of drugs that undergo passive transfer, including age-appropriate parameters. The model was validated for the analgesics paracetamol, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen and naproxen, and for a pediatric meningitis population by empirical optimization of the blood-brain barrier penetration of the antibiotic meropenem. Plasma and CSF drug concentrations derived from the literature were used to perform visual predictive checks and to calculate ratios between simulated and observed area under the concentration curves (AUCs) in order to evaluate model performance. Model-simulated concentrations were comparable to observed data over a broad age range (3 months-15 years postnatal age) for all drugs investigated. The ratios between observed and simulated AUCs (AUCo/AUCp) were within 2-fold difference both in plasma (range 0.92-1.09) and in CSF (range 0.64-1.23) indicating acceptable model performance. The model was also able to describe disease-mediated changes in neonates and young children (<3m postnatal age) related to meningitis and sepsis (range AUCo/AUCp plasma: 1.64-1.66, range AUCo/AUCp CSF: 1.43-1.73).

Although there are published meta-analyses of analgesic therapy in PHN, and neuropathic pain in general, the evidence base has been substantially enhanced by the recent publication of several major trials. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for both efficacy and adverse events of analgesic therapy for PHN.<h4>Methods and findings</h4>We systematically searched databases (MEDLINE 1966-2004, EMBASE 1988-2004, CINAHL 1982-2002, and PubMed [29 October 2004]) for trials of PHN. We also searched references of retrieved studies and review articles for further trials. We included trials that examined adult patients with PHN of greater duration than 3 mo, that were blinded, randomised, and had at least one measure of pain outcome. Dichotomous pain outcome data were extracted for 50% decrease in baseline pain using a hierarchy of pain/pain-relief measurement tools. Where available, dichotomous data were also collected for adverse events. Calculated estimates of efficacy included relative benefit and number needed to treat. Of 62 studies identified, 35 were randomised controlled trials. Of these, 31 were placebo controlled and suitable for meta-analysis, from which it was possible to extract dichotomous efficacy outcome data from 25. This meta-analysis revealed that there is evidence to support the use of the following orally administered therapies: tricyclic antidepressants, ""strong"" opioids, gabapentin, tramadol, and pregabalin. Topical therapies associated with efficacy were lidocaine 5% patch and capsaicin. Finally, a single study of spinal intrathecal administration of lidocaine and methyl prednisolone demonstrated efficacy, although this has yet to be replicated. Data suggest that the following therapies are not associated with efficacy in PHN: certain NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., oral memantine, oral dextromethorphan, intravenous ketamine), codeine, ibuprofen, lorazepam, certain 5HT1 receptor agonists, and acyclovir. Topical administration of benzydamine, diclofenac/diethyl ether, and vincristine (iontophoresis) are similarly not associated with efficacy, nor are intrathecal administration of lidocaine alone or epidural administration of lidocaine and methylprednisolone, intravenous therapy with lidocaine, subcutaneous injection of Cronassial, or acupuncture. However, many of the trials that demonstrated a lack of efficacy represented comparatively low numbers of patient episodes or were single-dose studies, so it may be appropriate to regard such interventions as ""not yet adequately tested"" rather than demonstrating ""no evidence of efficacy."" Topical aspirin/diethyl ether has not been adequately tested.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The evidence base supports the oral use of tricyclic antidepressants, certain opioids, and gabapentinoids in PHN. Topical therapy with lidocaine patches and capsaicin is similarly supported.

In search for this mechanism we found that Abeta(1-42) oligomers, the assembly state correlating best with cognitive decline in AD, but not Abeta fibrils, induce a massive entry of Ca(2+) in neurons and promote mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload as shown by bioluminescence imaging of targeted aequorin in individual neurons. Abeta oligomers induce also mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release, apoptosis and cell death. Mitochondrial depolarization prevents mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, cytochrome c release and cell death. In addition, we found that a series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including salicylate, sulindac sulfide, indomethacin, ibuprofen and R-flurbiprofen depolarize mitochondria and inhibit mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, cytochrome c release and cell death induced by Abeta oligomers.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) occupies a central position in AD and APP-derived amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are thought to play a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis. Nonetheless, it is becoming clear that AD etiology is highly complex and that factors other than Abeta also contribute to AD pathogenesis. APP intracellular domain (AICD) is generated together with Abeta and we recently showed that AICD transgenic mice recapitulate pathological features of AD such as tau hyperphosphorylation, memory deficits and neurodegeneration without increasing the Abeta levels. Since impaired adult neurogenesis is shown to augment memory deficits in AD mouse models, here we examined the status of adult neurogenesis in AICD transgenic mice.<h4>Methodology/principal finding</h4>We previously generated transgenic mice co-expressing 59-residue long AICD fragment and its binding partner Fe65. Hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation was determined by BrdU incorporation at 1.5, 3 and 12 months of age. Only male transgenic and their respective wilt type littermate control mice were used. We find age-dependent decrease in BrdU incorporation and doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of AICD transgenic mice suggesting impaired adult neurogenesis. This deficit resulted from decreased proliferation and survival, whereas neuronal differentiation remained unaffected. Importantly, this impairment was independent of Abeta since APP-KO mice expressing AICD also exhibit reduced neurogenesis. The defects in adult neurogenesis are prevented by long-term treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents ibuprofen or naproxen suggesting that neuroinflammation is critically involved in impaired adult neurogenesis in AICD transgenic mice.<h4>Conclusion/significance</h4>Since adult neurogenesis is crucial for spatial memory, which is particularly vulnerable in AD, these findings suggest that AICD can exacerbate memory defects in AD by impairing adult neurogenesis. Our findings further establish that AICD, in addition to Abeta, contributes to AD pathology and that neuroinflammation plays a much broader role in AD pathogenesis than previously thought.",2010,,"Ghosal K, Stathopoulos A, Pimplikar SW.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011866,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen is currently used to treat PDA with ductal closure failure rate up to 40%. We test the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 CYP2C8/2C9 polymorphisms may predict ibuprofen response.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>We studied extremely preterm neonates with haemodynamically significant PDA and treated with ibuprofen. One or two variant CYP2C8 and/or 2C9 alleles were found in 17% of the population, most of them were from Caucasian ethnicity (67-74%). Response to ibuprofen and clinical course of infants carrying variants CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 were similar. Comparing infants with wild type or variant CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genotypes, response rate to ibuprofen was significantly higher in wild type than in mutated carriers in univariate analysis (73% versus 52%, p = 0.04). Comparing responders (ductus closure; n = 75) and non-responders (surgical ligation; n = 36), the only two factors significantly associated with the response to ibuprofen using multivariate analysis were higher gestational age and non Caucasian ethnicity but not CYP2C polymorphism.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CYP2C polymorphism was not associated with PDA response to ibuprofen and this factor appears not appropriate to optimize the ductal closure rate by modulating ibuprofen dosing strategy.

Specifically, we examined forearm flexor digitorum muscles for changes in connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; a matrix protein associated with fibrosis), collagen type I (Col1; a matrix component), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1; an upstream modulator of CTGF and collagen), in rats performing one of two repetitive tasks, with or without anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Methodology/results</h4>To examine the roles of force versus repetition, rats performed either a high repetition negligible force food retrieval task (HRNF), or a high repetition high force handle-pulling task (HRHF), for up to 9 weeks, with results compared to trained only (TR-NF or TR-HF) and normal control rats. Grip strength declined with both tasks, with the greatest declines in 9-week HRHF rats. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of HRNF muscles showed increased expression of Col1 in weeks 3-9, and CTGF in weeks 6 and 9. Immunohistochemistry confirmed PCR results, and also showed greater increases of CTGF and collagen matrix in 9-week HRHF rats than 9-week HRNF rats. ELISA, and immunohistochemistry revealed greater increases of TGFB1 in TR-HF and 6-week HRHF, compared to 6-week HRNF rats. To examine the role of inflammation, results from 6-week HRHF rats were compared to rats receiving ibuprofen or anti-TNF-α treatment in HRHF weeks 4-6. Both treatments attenuated HRHF-induced increases in CTGF and fibrosis by 6 weeks of task performance. Ibuprofen attenuated TGFB1 increases and grip strength declines, matching our prior results with anti-TNFα.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Performance of highly repetitive tasks was associated with force-dependent declines in grip strength and increased fibrogenic-related proteins in flexor digitorum muscles.

Most lipases used today originate from mesophilic organisms and are susceptible to thermal denaturation whereas only few possess high thermotolerance. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of two novel thermostable bacterial lipases identified by functional metagenomic screenings. Metagenomic libraries were constructed from enrichment cultures maintained at 65 to 75 °C and screened resulting in the identification of initially 10 clones with lipolytic activities. Subsequently, two ORFs were identified encoding lipases, LipS and LipT. Comparative sequence analyses suggested that both enzymes are members of novel lipase families. LipS is a 30.2 kDa protein and revealed a half-life of 48 h at 70 °C. The lipT gene encoded for a multimeric enzyme with a half-life of 3 h at 70 °C. LipS had an optimum temperature at 70 °C and LipT at 75 °C. Both enzymes catalyzed hydrolysis of long-chain (C(12) and C(14)) fatty acid esters and additionally hydrolyzed a number of industry-relevant substrates. LipS was highly specific for (R)-ibuprofen-phenyl ester with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 99%. Furthermore, LipS was able to synthesize 1-propyl laurate and 1-tetradecyl myristate at 70 °C with rates similar to those of the lipase CalB from Candida antarctica.

We therefore determined oxidative stress in cultured cells and evaluated its occurrence in C57BL/6 mice. Using both cultured neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and macrophage (RAW 264.7) cell lines and also brain tissues of oxaliplatin-treated mice, we investigated whether oxaliplatin (OXA) induces oxidative stress and apoptosis. Cultured cells were treated with 2-200 µM OXA for 24 h. The effects of pharmacological inhibitors of oxidative stress or inflammation (N-acetyl cysteine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) were also tested. Inhibitors were added 30 min before OXA treatment and then in combination with OXA for 24 h. In SH-SY5Y cells, OXA caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in viability, a large increase in ROS and NO production, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial impairment as assessed by a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential, which are deleterious for the cell. An increase in levels of negatively charged phospholipids such as cardiolipin but also phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, was also observed. Additionally, OXA caused concentration-dependent P2X7 receptor activation, increased chromatin condensation and caspase-3 activation associated with TNF-α and IL-6 release. The majority of these toxic effects were equally observed in Raw 264.7 which also presented high levels of PGE2. Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with pharmacological inhibitors significantly reduced or blocked all the neurotoxic OXA effects. In OXA-treated mice (28 mg/kg cumulated dose) significant cold hyperalgesia and oxidative stress in the tested brain areas were shown.

In addition, inflammation often leads to a harmful generation of nitric oxide. Efforts are being done in discovering safer NSAIDs molecules capable of inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and nitric oxide to reduce the side effects associated with long term therapies.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>The analogue of arachidonic acid (AA), 2-hydroxy-arachidonic acid (2OAA), was designed to inhibit the activities of COX1 and COX2 and it was predicted to have similar binding energies as AA for the catalytic sites of COX1 and COX2. The interaction of AA and 2OAA with COX1 and COX2 was investigated calculating the free energy of binding and the Fukui function. Toxicity was determined in mouse microglial BV-2 cells. COX1 and COX2 (PGH2 production) activities were measured in vitro. COX1 and COX2 expression in human macrophage-like U937 cells were carried out by Western blot, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR analysis. NO production (Griess method) and iNOS (Western blot) were determined in mouse microglial BV-2 cells. The comparative efficacy of 2OAA, ibuprofen and cortisone in lowering TNF-α serum levels was determined in C57BL6/J mice challenged with LPS. We show that the presence of the -OH group reduces the likelihood of 2OAA being subjected to H* abstraction in COX, without altering significantly the free energy of binding. The 2OAA inhibited COX1 and COX2 activities and the expression of COX2 in human U937 derived macrophages challenged with LPS. In addition, 2OAA inhibited iNOS expression and the production of NO in BV-2 microglial cells.

Single as well as group substance studies were carried out. In group studies substance group compositions, transport medium and serum content were varied, transport inhibitors verapamil and probenecid were added. Resulted permeability coefficients were compared and normalized to internal standards diazepam and carboxyfluorescein. Transport rankings of NSAIDs across each model were obtained. Single substance studies showed similar rankings as corresponding group studies across PBMEC/C1-2 or ECV304 cell layers. Serum content, glioma conditioned medium and inhibitors probenecid and verapamil influenced resulted permeability significantly. Basic differences of transport properties of the investigated NSAIDs were similar comparing all three in vitro BBB models.

Rapaics have shown anti-inflammatory activity, which is strongly influenced by their chemical structures and chain conformations. However, the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect by these polysaccharides have yet to be elucidated. A RG-II polysaccharide (KMPS-2E, Mw 84.8 kDa) was isolated from KMPS and its chemical structure was characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. The backbone of KMPS-2E consisted of units of [→6) -β-D-Galp (1→3)-β-L-Rhap-(1→4)-β-D-GalpA-(1→3)-β-D-Galp-(1→] with the side chain →5)-β-D-Arap (1→3, 5)-β-D-Arap (1→ attached to the backbone through O-4 of (1→3,4)-L-Rhap. T-β-D-Galp is attached to the backbone through O-6 of (1→3,6)-β-D-Galp residues and T-β-D-Ara is connected to the end group of each chain. The anti-inflammatory effects of KMPS-2E and the underlying mechanisms using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema were investigated. KMPS-2E (50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) inhibits iNOS, TLR4, phospho-NF-κB-p65 expression, phosphor-IKK, phosphor-IκB-α expression as well as the degradation of IκB-α and the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and IL-6) mediated by the NF-κB signal pathways in macrophages. KMPS-2E also inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-κB as assayed by electrophorectic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in a dose-dependent manner and it reduced NF-κB DNA binding affinity by 62.1% at 200 µg/mL. In rats, KMPS-2E (200 mg/kg) can significantly inhibit carrageenan-induced paw edema as ibuprofen (200 mg/kg) within 3 h after a single oral dose.

The indiscriminate use of antibiotics and other biological drugs are reported to result in thrombocytopenia, which is often neglected during the treatment regime. In addition, augmented oxidative stress induced by drugs and pathological conditions has also been shown to induce thrombocytopenia, which seems to be the most obvious consequence of elevated rate of platelet apoptosis. Thus, blocking oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis would be of prime importance in order to negotiate thrombocytopenia and associated human pathologies. The current study presents the synthesis and platelet protective nature of novel ibuprofen derivatives. The potent anti-oxidant ibuprofen derivative 4f was selected for the study and the platelet protective efficacy and platelet aggregation inhibitory property has been demonstrated. The compound 4f dose dependently mitigates the oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis in both platelet rich plasma and washed platelets. The platelet protective nature of compound 4f was determined by assessing various apoptotic markers such as ROS generation, cytosolic Ca2+ levels, PS externalization, cytochrome C translocation, Caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytotoxicity, LDH leakage and tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins. Furthermore, compound 4f dose dependently ameliorated agonist induced platelet aggregation. Therefore, compound 4f can be estimated as a potential candidate in the treatment regime of pathological disorders associated with platelet activation and apoptosis.

These microneedle-lyophilised wafer compositions were robust and effectively penetrated skin, swelling extensively, but being removed intact. In in vitro delivery experiments across excised neonatal porcine skin, approximately 44 mg of the model high dose small molecule drug ibuprofen sodium was delivered in 24 h, equating to 37% of the loading in the lyophilised reservoir. The super swelling microneedles delivered approximately 1.24 mg of the model protein ovalbumin over 24 h, equivalent to a delivery efficiency of approximately 49%. The integrated microneedle-lyophilised wafer delivery system produced a progressive increase in plasma concentrations of ibuprofen sodium in rats over 6 h, with a maximal concentration of approximately 179 µg/ml achieved in this time. The plasma concentration had fallen to 71±6.7 µg/ml by 24 h. Ovalbumin levels peaked in rat plasma after only 1 hour at 42.36±17.01 ng/ml. Ovalbumin plasma levels then remained almost constant up to 6 h, dropping somewhat at 24 h, when 23.61±4.84 ng/ml was detected. This work represents a significant advancement on conventional microneedle systems, which are presently only suitable for bolus delivery of very potent drugs and vaccines.

Promoting regeneration of severed axons requires the inactivation of growth inhibitory influences from the tissue environment and stimulation of the neuron intrinsic growth potential. Especially glial cell derived factors, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, Nogo-A, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and myelin in general, prevent axon regeneration. Most of the glial growth inhibiting factors converge onto the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway in neurons. Although conditions in the injured nervous system are clearly different from those during neurite outgrowth in vitro, here we use a chemical approach to manipulate Rho/ROCK signalling with small-molecule agents to encourage neurite outgrowth in cell culture. The development of therapeutic treatments requires drug testing not only on neurons of experimental animals, but also on human neurons. Using human NT2 model neurons, we demonstrate that the pain reliever Ibuprofen decreases RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A GTPase) activation and promotes neurite growth. Inhibition of the downstream effector Rho kinase by the drug Y-27632 results in a strong increase in neurite outgrowth. Conversely, activation of the Rho pathway by lysophosphatidic acid results in growth cone collapse and eventually to neurite retraction. Finally, we show that blocking of Rho kinase, but not RhoA results in an increase in neurons bearing neurites.

The MSM prepared at 500°C (MSM-500) had the highest surface area, pore size, and volume, and the results of isotherms and the kinetics of ibuprofen (IBP) removal indicated that MSM-500 had the highest sorption capacity and fastest removal speed vs. SBA-15 and zeolite. Compared with commercial granular activated carbon (GAC), MSM-500 had a ~100 times higher sorption rate at neutral pH. IBP uptake by MSM-500 was thermodynamically favorable at room temperature, which was interpreted as indicating relatively weak bonding because the entropy (∆adsS, -0.07 J mol(-1) K(-1)) was much smaller. Five times recycling tests revealed that MSM-500 had 83-87% recovery efficiencies and slower uptake speeds due to slight deformation of the outer pore structure. In the IBP delivery test, MSM-500 drug loading was 41%, higher than the reported value of SBA-15 (31%). The in vitro release of IBP was faster, almost 100%, reaching equilibrium within a few hours, indicating its effective loading and unloading characteristics.

While achievements were implemented in the intensive care treatment, all attempts within the field of novel therapeutics have failed. As a consequence new medications and improved patient stratification as well as a thoughtful management of the support therapies are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the simultaneous administration of ibuprofen as a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and Pep19-2.5 (Aspidasept), a newly developed antimicrobial peptide. Here, we show a synergistic therapeutic effect of combined Pep19-2.5-ibuprofen treatment in an endotoxemia mouse model of sepsis. In vivo protection correlates with a reduction in plasma levels of both tumor necrosis factor α and prostaglandin E, as a likely consequence of Pep19-2.5 and ibuprofen-dependent blockade of TLR4 and COX pro-inflammatory cascades, respectively. This finding is further characterised and confirmed in a transcriptome analysis of LPS-stimulated human monocytes. The transcriptome analyses showed that Pep19-2.5 and ibuprofen exerted a synergistic global effect both on the number of regulated genes as well as on associated gene ontology and pathway expression.

Historically, phospholipases have been considered to be the primary generator of the arachidonic acid (AA) precursor pool for generating PGE2 and other eicosanoids. However, recent studies have demonstrated that monoacyglycerol lipase (MAGL), through hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, provides a major source of AA for PGE2 synthesis in the mammalian brain under basal and neuroinflammatory states. We show here that either genetic or pharmacological ablation of MAGL leads to significantly reduced fever responses in both centrally or peripherally-administered lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-1β-induced fever models in mice. We also show that a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist does not attenuate these anti-pyrogenic effects of MAGL inhibitors. Thus, much like traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, MAGL inhibitors can control fever, but appear to do so through restricted control over prostaglandin production in the nervous system.",2015,,"Sanchez-Alavez M, Nguyen W, Mori S, Moroncini G, Viader A, Nomura DK, Cravatt BF, Conti B.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134437&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

For glioma, research has generally focused on diclofenac; however data on other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, is limited. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the cellular, molecular, and metabolic effects of ibuprofen and diclofenac on human glioblastoma cells.<h4>Methods</h4>Glioma cell lines were treated with ibuprofen or diclofenac to investigate functional effects on proliferation and cell motility. Cell cycle, extracellular lactate levels, lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) expression and activity, as well as inhibition of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT-3) signaling pathway, were determined. Specific effects of diclofenac and ibuprofen on STAT-3 were investigated by comparing their effects with those of the specific STAT-3 inhibitor STATTIC.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen treatment led to a stronger inhibition of cell growth and migration than treatment with diclofenac. Proliferation was affected by cell cycle arrest at different checkpoints by both agents. In addition, diclofenac, but not ibuprofen, decreased lactate levels in all concentrations used. Both decreased STAT-3 phosphorylation; however, diclofenac led to decreased c-myc expression and subsequent reduction in LDH-A activity, whereas treatment with ibuprofen in higher doses induced c-myc expression and less LDH-A alteration.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study indicates that both ibuprofen and diclofenac strongly inhibit glioma cells, but the subsequent metabolic responses of both agents are distinct. We postulate that ibuprofen may inhibit tumor cells also by COX- and lactate-independent mechanisms after long-term treatment in physiological dosages, whereas diclofenac mainly acts by inhibition of STAT-3 signaling and downstream modulation of glycolysis.",2015,,"Leidgens V, Seliger C, Jachnik B, Welz T, Leukel P, Vollmann-Zwerenz A, Bogdahn U, Kreutz M, Grauer OM, Hau P.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140613,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The prepared MPPAC was assessed by several physicochemical analyses, and batch tests were performed for ibuprofen (IBP) removal. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and N2 gas isotherms revealed that magnetite and maghemite were homogeneous and deposited mostly on the surface of PPAC without a significant clogging effect on the micropores. Isotherm results showed that 3.8% Fe (w/w) impregnated PPAC [MPPAC-Fe(3.8%)] had about 2.2-fold higher maximum sorption capacity (157.3 mg g-1) and a 2.5-fold higher sorption density (0.23 mg m-2) than pristine PPAC. Both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and isotherm data indicated that the high sorption capacity and density of IBP by MPPAC was primarily attributable to donor-acceptor complexes with the C = O group and dispersive π-π interactions with the carbon surface. Based on kinetic and repeated adsorption tests, pore diffusion was the rate-limiting step, and MPPAC-Fe(3.8%) had about 1.9~2.8- and 9.1~15.8-fold higher rate constants than MPPAC-Fe(8.6%) and palm shell-waste granular activated carbon (PGAC, avg. size 621 μm), respectively.

The Flu-AM1 and Ibu-AM5 derivatives of flurbiprofen and ibuprofen retain similar COX-inhibitory properties and are more potent inhibitors of FAAH than the parent compounds. However, little is known as to the nature of their interaction with FAAH, or to the importance of their chirality. This has been explored here.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>FAAH inhibitory activity was measured in rat brain homogenates and in lysates expressing either wild-type or FAAH(T488A)-mutated enzyme. Molecular modelling was undertaken using both docking and molecular dynamics. The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of Flu-AM1 inhibited rat FAAH with similar potencies (IC50 values of 0.74 and 0.99 μM, respectively), whereas the (S)-enantiomer of Ibu-AM5 (IC50 0.59 μM) was more potent than the (R)-enantiomer (IC50 5.7 μM). Multiple inhibition experiments indicated that both (R)-Flu-AM1 and (S)-Ibu-AM5 inhibited FAAH in a manner mutually exclusive to carprofen. Computational studies indicated that the binding site for the Flu-AM1 and Ibu-AM5 enantiomers was located between the acyl chain binding channel and the membrane access channel, in a site overlapping the carprofen binding site, and showed a binding mode in line with that proposed for carprofen and other non-covalent ligands. The potency of (R)-Flu-AM1 was lower towards lysates expressing FAAH mutated at the proposed carprofen binding area than in lysates expressing wild-type FAAH.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>The study provides kinetic and structural evidence that the enantiomers of Flu-AM1 and Ibu-AM5 bind in the substrate channel of FAAH.

The most common drugs used to relieve these symptoms are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are not typically considered antibiotics. Here, we investigate the effects of NSAIDs on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and the modulation of bacterial efflux pumps.<h4>Methodology</h4>The activity of 12 NSAID active substances, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and eight relevant medicinal products was analyzed with or without pump inhibitors against 89 strains of Gram-negative rods by determining the MICs. Furthermore, the effects of NSAIDs on the susceptibility of clinical strains to antimicrobial agents with or without PAβN (Phe-Arg-β-naphtylamide) were measured.<h4>Results</h4>The MICs of diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen, in the presence of PAβN, were significantly (≥4-fold) reduced, decreasing to 25-1600 mg/L, against the majority of the studied strains. In the case of acetylsalicylic acid only for 5 and 7 out of 12 strains of P. mirabilis and E. coli, respectively, a 4-fold increase in susceptibility in the presence of PAβN was observed. The presence of Aspirin resulted in a 4-fold increase in the MIC of ofloxacin against only two strains of E. coli among 48 tested clinical strains, which included species such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. maltophilia. Besides, the medicinal products containing the following NSAIDs, diclofenac, mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen, did not cause the decrease of clinical strains' susceptibility to antibiotics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The effects of PAβN on the susceptibility of bacteria to NSAIDs indicate that some NSAIDs are substrates for efflux pumps in Gram-negative rods.

In melanoma, despite recent advances in targeted therapy and immunomodulatory therapies, this cancer remains difficult to treat. Our previous studies show melanoma cells interact with skin cells in their invasion into tissue engineered skin and suggest inflammation stimulates invasion. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. To do this we developed a wounded and inflamed in vitro 3D melanoma model in which to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. The tissue engineered skin model was based on human de-epidermised acellular dermis to which keratinocytes, fibroblasts and three different melanoma cell lines were added in various combinations. A simple incisional wound was made in the model and TNF-α and fibrin were added to simulate conditions of inflammation. Topical ibuprofen in a hydrogel was added and the extent of melanoma invasion into the dermis was assessed under the various conditions. The results showed that penetration of two of the cell lines (HBL and A375SM) into the tissue engineered skin was exacerbated by wounding and ibuprofen significantly decreased invasion of A375SM cells and slightly reduced invasion of HBL cells. A third cell line, C8161, was aggressively invasive under all conditions to an extent that was not influenced by wounding, TNF-α or the addition of ibuprofen. In summary, the results for one these cell lines (and a trend for a second cell line) support the hypothesis that a wound environment is conducive to melanoma invasion but the local addition of an anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen may attenuate invasion.",2016,,"Marques CM, MacNeil S.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156931&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The in vitro antifungal activities of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp. were recently discovered. In the present study, the in vitro interactions between three NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium) and commonly used antifungal agents (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B) against planktonic and biofilm cells of T. asahii were evaluated using the checkerboard microdilution method. The spectrophotometric method and the XTT reduction assay were used to generate data on biofilm cells. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) and the ΔE model were compared to interpret drug interactions. Using the FICI, the highest percentages of synergistic effects against planktonic cells (86.67%) and biofilm cells (73.33%) were found for amphotericin B/ibuprofen, and caspofungin/ibuprofen showed appreciable percentages (73.33% for planktonic form and 60.00% for biofilm) as well. We did not observe antagonism. The ΔE model gave consistent results with FICI (86.67%). Our findings suggest that amphotericin B/ibuprofen and caspofungin/ibuprofen combinations have potential effects against T. asahii.

Drug repurposing has become of increasing interest to improve standard therapy. Statins and NSAIDs inhibit glioma cell growth in vitro and in vivo, but data on statin and NSAID treatment in relation to survival of patients with HGG are sparse.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed multivariable adjusted Cox-regression analyses among 1,093 patients with HGG from a regional cancer registry to obtain Hazard Ratios (HRs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) according to treatment with statins or NSAIDs. Data on dose and duration of treatment was mostly lacking in our analysis, therefore we were not able to perform dose-response analyses.<h4>Results</h4>Use of statins was unrelated to OS or PFS of glioma patients. Use of aspirin was associated with prolonged OS and PFS in patients with WHO grade III, but not WHO grade IV glioma. Use of other NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen) or non-NSAID analgesics (paracetamol) was mostly unrelated to survival of glioma patients. Use of selective COX-2 inhibitors and metamizol was related to inferior patient survival in parts of the analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Use of statins or NSAIDS, including aspirin, was not associated with prolonged OS or PFS of patients with WHO grade IV glioma in our selected cohort.

This study investigated the effect of ibuprofen (IBU) and triclosan (TCS), alone and in combination to the performance and enzymatic activity of AS bacterial community. The assays were carried out in a pilot AS reactor operating for two-weeks under continuous dosage of pollutants. The microbial activity was tracked by measuring oxygen uptake rate, esterase activity, oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities. It was found that IBU and TCS had no acute toxic effects on reactor biomass concentration. TCS led to significant decrease of COD removal efficiency, which dropped from 90% to 35%. Continuous exposure to IBU, TCS and their mixtures increased the activities of glutathione s-transferase (GST) and esterase as a response to oxidative damage. A high increase in GST activity was associated with non-reversible toxic damage while peaks of esterase activity combined with moderate GST increase were attributed to an adaptive response.",2020,,"Amariei G, Boltes K, Rosal R, Leton P.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227267,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study employed single cell and population imaging to investigate drug-induced perturbations of leading edge pseudopod morphology in cultured, polarized RAW macrophages. The drugs tested included representative therapeutics (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) as well as control drugs (PDGF, Gö6976, wortmannin). Notably, slow addition of any of the four therapeutics to cultured macrophages, mimicking the slowly increasing plasma concentration reported for standard oral dosage in patients, yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology. This finding is consistent with the well established clinical safety of these drugs. However, rapid drug addition to cultured macrophages revealed four distinct classes of effects on the leading edge pseudopod: (i) non-perturbing drug exposures yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac); (ii) adaptive exposures yielded temporary collapse of the extended pseudopod and its signature PI(3,4,5)P3 lipid signal followed by slow recovery of extended pseudopod morphology (ibuprofen, acetaminophen); (iii) disruptive exposures yielded long-term pseudopod collapse (Gö6976, wortmannin); and (iv) activating exposures yielded pseudopod expansion (PDGF). The novel observation of adaptive exposures leads us to hypothesize that rapid addition of an adaptive drug overwhelms an intrinsic or extrinsic adaptation system yielding temporary collapse followed by adaptive recovery, while slow addition enables gradual adaptation to counteract the drug perturbation in real time. Overall, the results illustrate an approach that may help identify therapeutic drugs that temporarily inhibit the leading edge pseudopod during extreme inflammation events, and toxic drugs that yield long term inhibition of the pseudopod with negative consequences for innate immunity.

While there is mounting evidence that in vitro diffusion studies in mammalian skin can provide valid information regarding likely in vivo absorption, little is known whether such a correlation exists between in vitro diffusion testing and in vivo blood levels in amphibians. The current study used previously-reported in vitro absorption data for caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen across isolated skin from the cane toad (Rhinella marina) to produce a series of linear mixed-effect models of the absorption parameters flux and permeability coefficient (Kp). Models investigated the relative impacts of animal weight, physicochemical characteristics of the applied chemical (logP or molecular weight), and site of application. The top models were then used to predict the flux, Kp and serum concentrations of the same three model chemicals. Finally, the absorption of these chemicals was determined in live cane toads, and results compared to the model predictions. LogP and site of application were included in all top models. In vivo absorption rates were lower than predicted for all chemicals, however, the models provided reasonable predictions of serum concentration, with factors of difference (FOD) ranging from 2.5-10.5. Ibuprofen, the chemical with the highest relative lipophilicity, had the poorest predictive performance, consistently having the highest FOD for all predictions. This report presents the first models of percutaneous absorption in an amphibian. These models provide a basic method to establish the approximate in vivo absorption of hydrophilic and moderately-lipophilic chemicals through frog skin, and could therefore be used to predict absorption when formulating such chemicals for treatment of disease in frogs, or for risk-assessments regarding chemical pollutants in frog habitats.",2020,,"Llewelyn VK, Berger L, Glass BD.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235737,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

As the novelty, this investigation aims to develop a mechanistic modeling approach and consequently its related CFD-based simulations to evaluate the molecular separation efficiency of ibuprofen (IP) and its metabolite 4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP) from water inside a porous membrane contactor (PMC). For this purpose, octanol has been applied as an organic phase to extract IP and 4-IBAP from the aqueous solution due to high solubility of solutes in octanol. Finite element (FE) technique is used as a promising tool to simultaneously solve continuity and Navier-Stokes equations and their associated boundary conditions in tube, shell and porous membrane compartments of the PMC.

BRSV causes a respiratory syndrome in calves, which is associated with severe bronchiolitis. In this study we describe the effect of treatment with antiviral fusion protein inhibitor (FPI) and ibuprofen, on gene expression in lung tissue of calves infected with BRSV. Calves infected with BRSV are an excellent model of human RSV in infants: we hypothesized that FPI in combination with ibuprofen would provide the best therapeutic intervention for both species. The following experimental treatment groups of BRSV infected calves were used: 1) ibuprofen day 3-10, 2) ibuprofen day 5-10, 3) placebo, 4) FPI day 5-10, 5) FPI and ibuprofen day 5-10, 6) FPI and ibuprofen day 3-10. All calves were infected with BRSV on day 0. Daily clinical evaluation with monitoring of virus shedding by qRT-PCR was conducted. On day10 lung tissue with lesions (LL) and non-lesional (LN) was collected at necropsy, total RNA extracted, and RNA sequencing performed. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted with Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The most significant differential gene expression in BRSV infected lung tissues was observed in the comparison of LL with LN; oxidative stress and cell damage was especially noticeable. Innate and adaptive immune functions were reduced in LL. As expected, combined treatment with FPI and Ibuprofen, when started early, made the most difference in gene expression patterns in comparison with placebo, especially in pathways related to the innate and adaptive immune response in both LL and LN. Ibuprofen, when used alone, negatively affected the antiviral response and caused higher virus loads as shown by increased viral shedding.

In vertebrates and corals, COX must be N-glycosylated on at least two asparagine residues in the N-(X)-S/T motif to be catalytically active. Although COX glycosylation requirement is well-characterized in many species, whether crustacean COXs require N-glycosylation for their enzymatic function have not been investigated. In this study, a 1,842-base pair cox gene was obtained from ovarian cDNA of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon. Sequence analysis revealed that essential catalytic residues and putative catalytic domains of P. monodon COX (PmCOX) were well-conserved in relation to other vertebrate and crustacean COXs. Expression of PmCOX in 293T cells increased levels of secreted PGE2 and PGF2α up to 60- and 77-fold, respectively, compared to control cells. Incubation of purified PmCOX with endoglycosidase H, which cleaves oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins, reduced the molecular mass of PmCOX. Similarly, addition of tunicamycin, which inhibits N-linked glycosylation, in PmCOX-expressing cells resulted in PmCOX protein with lower molecular mass than those obtained from untreated cells, suggesting that PmCOX was N-glycosylated. Three potential glycosylation sites of PmCOX were identified at N79, N170 and N424. Mutational analysis revealed that although all three residues were glycosylated, only mutations at N170 and N424 completely abolished catalytic function. Inhibition of COX activity by ibuprofen treatment also decreased the levels of PGE2 in shrimp haemolymph.

We studied the dynamics of ibuprofen decomposition and its relationship with the physiological status of bacteria and with additional carbon and energy sources. The involvement of cytoplasmic enzymes in ibuprofen biodegradation was confirmed. Within the tested actinobacteria, Rhodococcus cerastii IEGM 1278 was capable of complete oxidation of 100 μg/L and 100 mg/L of ibuprofen in 30 h and 144 h, respectively, in the presence of an alternative carbon source (n-hexadecane). Besides, the presence of ibuprofen induced a transition of rhodococci from single- to multicellular lifeforms, a shift to more negative zeta potential values, and a decrease in the membrane permeability. The initial steps of ibuprofen biotransformation by R. cerastii IEGM 1278 involved the formation of hydroxylated and decarboxylated derivatives with higher phytotoxicity than the parent compound (ibuprofen).

Evidence indicates that a higher temperature during the acute illness is a risk factor for post-infectious neurologic sequelae. As such, aggressive antipyretic therapy may be warranted among children with complicated malaria at substantial risk of brain injury. Previous clinical trials conducted primarily in children with uncomplicated malaria and using only a single antipyretic medication have shown limited benefits in terms of fever reduction; however, no studies to date have examined malaria fever management using dual therapies. In this clinical trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy, children hospitalized with central nervous system (CNS) malaria will be randomized to usual care (acetaminophen every 6 hours for a temperature ≥ 38.5°C) vs. prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen every 6 hours for 72 hours.<h4>Methods</h4>In this double-blinded, placebo controlled, two-armed clinical trial, we will enroll 284 participants from three settings at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi; at the University Teaching Hospitals Children's Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and at Chipata Central Hospital, Chipata, Zambia. Parents or guardians must provide written informed consent. Eligible participants are 2-11 years with evidence of P. falciparum malaria infection by peripheral blood smear or rapid diagnostic test with CNS symptoms associated with malaria. Eligible children will receive treatment allocation randomization either to standard of care for fever management or to prophylactic, scheduled treatment every 6 hours for 72 hours with dual antipyretic therapies using acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Assignment to treatment groups will be with 1:1 allocation using blocked randomization. The primary outcome will be maximum temperature in the 72 hours after enrolment. Secondary outcomes include parasite clearance as determined by quantitative Histidine Rich Protein II and seizures through 72 hours after enrolment.<h4>Discussion</h4>This clinical trial seeks to challenge the practice paradigm of limited fever treatment based upon hyperpyrexia by evaluating the fever-reduction efficacy of more aggressive antipyretic using two antipyretics and prophylactic administration and will elucidate the impact of antipyretics on parasite clearance and acute symptomatic seizures. If aggressive antipyretic therapy is shown to safely reduce the maximum temperature, a clinical trial evaluating the neuroprotective effects of temperature reduction in CNS malaria is warranted.",2022,,"Chilombe MB, McDermott MP, Seydel KB, Mathews M, Mwenechanya M, Birbeck GL.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268414&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Forty-two patient profiles were generated, with varying levels of albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), age, and PromarkerD result. A web-based survey asked each physician to make monitoring/treatment decisions about eight randomly selected profiles. Data were analyzed using multivariable logit models.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred three primary care physicians and 197 endocrinologists completed the survey. PromarkerD result was most important for increasing the frequency of risk factor monitoring. PromarkerD was second to HbA1c in importance for deciding to prescribe sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2s) with a DKD indication, second to blood pressure for increasing the dose of lisinopril, and second to eGFR for replacing ibuprofen with a non-nephrotoxic medication. Compared with no PromarkerD results, a high-risk PromarkerD result was associated with significantly higher odds of increasing monitoring frequency (odds ratio [OR]: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.90-3.45), prescribing SGLT2s (OR: 1.98 [1.56-2.52]), increasing lisinopril dose (OR: 1.48 [1.17-1.87]), and replacing ibuprofen (OR: 1.78 [1.32-2.40]). A low-risk PromarkerD result was associated with significantly lower odds of increasing monitoring frequency (OR: 0.48 [0.37-0.64]), prescribing SGLT2s (OR: 0.70 [0.56-0.88]), and replacing ibuprofen (OR: 0.75 [0.57-0.99]).<h4>Conclusion</h4>PromarkerD could increase adoption of renoprotective interventions in patients at high risk for renal decline and lower the likelihood of aggressive treatment in those at low risk.

RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation model was induced by LPS, and RAW264.7 cells were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The fatty acid compositions were identified by GC-MS, combined with standard product spectrum information and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) database. Using chemometrics and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the components with VIP > 1 and P < 0.05 were selected as significant difference markers, and combined with biological methods to explore the biological significance of them. GC-MS identified 21 fatty acids in RAW264.7 cells, and screened significant difference biomarkers in each group. Among these biomarkers, C20:5 and C22:6 had significant changes in pairwise comparison among each group. Through ELISA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western Blot methods, the mRNA and protein expressions of IL-1β, NLRP3, GPR120 and β-Arrestin-2 were up-regulated after RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS and nigericin, and decreased after drug intervention. It indicated that the signal pathway centered on NLRP3 inflammasome was involved in the anti-inflammatory process of ibuprofen. It was the first time to study fatty acid metabolomics in RAW264.7 cell inflammatory model by GC-MS combined with chemometrics.

Newer antimalarial medications rapidly clear peripheral parasitemia and improve survival, but mortality remains high with no associated decline in post-malaria neurologic injury. A randomized controlled trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Fever RCT) for malarial fevers being conducted in Malawi and Zambia began enrollment in 2019. We propose to use neuroimaging in the context of the RCT to further evaluate neuroprotective effects of aggressive antipyretic therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>This observational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ancillary study will obtain neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in children previously enrolled in the Fever RCT at 1- and 12-months post discharge. Analysis will compare the odds of any brain injury between the aggressive antipyretic therapy and usual care groups based upon MRI structural abnormalities. For children unable to undergo imaging without deep sedation, neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes will be used to identify brain injury.<h4>Discussion</h4>Neuroimaging is a well-established, valid proxy for neurological outcomes after brain injury in pediatric CNS malaria.

Andrographolide is a naturally derived bioactive compound with promising anti-inflammatory activity in many clinical studies. However, its cytokine-inhibiting activity, in direct comparison to commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), has not been extensively investigated in existing literature. The anti-inflammatory activities of andrographolide and common NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen were measured on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ induced RAW264.7 cells. The levels of PGE2, nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α & LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines on differentiated human macrophage THP-1 cells were measured against increasing concentrations of andrographolide and aforementioned NSAIDs. The associated mechanistic pathway was examined on NFκB using flow cytometry on the human endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM9) (E-selectin) transfected RAW264.7 cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Andrographolide exhibited broad and potent anti-inflammatory and cytokine-inhibiting activity in both cell lines by inhibiting the release of IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ, which are known to play a key role in the etiology of cytokine storm and the pathogenesis of inflammation. In comparison, the tested NSAIDs demonstrated weak or no activity against proinflammatory mediators except for PGE2, where the activity of andrographolide (IC50 = 8.8 μM, 95% CI = 7.4 to 10.4 μM) was comparable to that of paracetamol (IC50 = 7.73 μM, 95% CI = 6.14 to 9.73 μM).

This study focuses on elucidating the impact of the NSAID ibuprofen (IBU) on cancer cells exposed to hypoxia, as the hypoxic microenvironment significantly influences tumor progression, metastatic potential, and therapy resistance. Given that carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a key hypoxia-associated protein and a promising therapeutic target due to its tumor-specific expression, we primarily examined the impact of IBU on CA IX and the transcription factors regulating CA IX expression. We found that IBU downregulates expression and protein level of CA IX in hypoxic colon carcinoma and head and neck cancer cells, resulting in a reduction of membranous CA IX. To elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon, we analyzed the key CA IX-regulating transcription factor HIF-1 and found decreased levels of the HIF-1α subunit in IBU-treated cells, leading to its impaired binding to the CA9 promotor. Analysis of another transcription factor involved in CA IX expression, NFκB, showed suppressed NFκB pathway under IBU treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated IBU-mediated induction in apoptosis in cancer cells, as well as a decrease in their ability to migrate. Our study is the first to demonstrate that ibuprofen downregulates carbonic anhydrase IX expression in hypoxic colon and head and neck tumor cells by decreasing HIF-1α levels. Additionally, ibuprofen impairs key transcription factors NFκB and STAT3, leading to reduced adaptation to hypoxic stress, decreased tumor cell viability, and migration.

(coriander) has long been valued for its culinary and medicinal uses. <i>C. sativum</i> essential oil (CsEO), particularly linalool-rich chemotypes, exhibits diverse biological activities; however, integrated evaluations encompassing neurological, inflammatory, and molecular targets remain limited. This study aimed to chemically characterize Peruvian CsEO and assess its anticonvulsant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, alongside those of pure linalool, while elucidating potential mechanisms through cytokine modulation and molecular docking of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>CsEO was extracted from Peruvian coriander seeds through steam distillation and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antioxidant activity was quantified using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assay. Anticonvulsant effects were tested in BALB/c mice using the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure model, analgesic activity through the acetic acid-induced writhing test, and anti-inflammatory effects in Holtzman rats using the carrageenan-induced paw edema model. Serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Molecular docking evaluated linalool's binding affinity to COX-1 and COX-2 relative to standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.<h4>Results</h4>GC-MS identified linalool as the major constituent (59.80%), alongside α-pinene (8.65%), camphor (8.48%), and γ-terpinene (7.09%). CsEO demonstrated potent antioxidant activity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>] = 32.04 μg/mL), exceeding that of linalool alone (IC<sub>50</sub> = 152.29 μg/mL). Significant anticonvulsant effects occurred at 200 mg/kg for both CsEO and linalool, increasing seizure latency by up to 87.20% and reducing seizure frequency by ~43%. In analgesic assays, linalool (200 mg/kg) achieved a 93.80% writhing reduction, comparable to tramadol, while CsEO showed strong but slightly lower efficacy. CsEO (200 mg/kg) inhibited carrageenan-induced edema by 51.35% at 4 h, reduced IL-1β by 49.8%, and IL-6 by 26.5%, effects comparable to ibuprofen. Docking revealed moderate linalool affinity for COX-1 (-5.70 kcal/mol) and COX-2 (-6.10 kcal/mol), sharing key hydrophobic interactions with reference drugs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Peruvian CsEO, characterized by a distinctive linalool-rich chemotype, exhibits significant multi-target pharmacological activities, with synergistic contributions from minor constituents enhancing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

The method outlined in this article draws together a number of scientific techniques and makes use of generally unwanted biological tissues as a means of determining skin inflammation <i>ex vivo</i>, and focuses on probing aspects of the arachidonic acid inflammation pathway. Freshly excised skin contains elevated levels of short-lived inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and, under viable conditions, COX-2 and its eicosanoid products will continue to be produced until tissue necrosis, providing a window of time in which relative levels can be probed to determine exacerbation due to an upregulating factor or downregulation due the presence of an agent exerting anti-inflammatory activity. <i>Ex vivo</i> porcine skin, mounted in Franz diffusion cells, is dosed topically with the xenobiotic challenge and then techniques such as Western blotting and immunohistochemistry can then be used to probe relative COX-2 levels on a semi-quantitative or qualitative level. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or LCMS can be used to determine relative prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) levels. Thus far, the technique has been used to examine the effects of topically applied anti-inflammatories (betamethasone, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and methotrexate), natural products (fish oil, Devil's claw extract and pomegranate rind extract) and drug delivery vehicle (polyNIPAM nanogels). Topically applied xenobiotics that modulate factors such as COX-2 and PGE-2 must penetrate the intact skin, and this provides direct evidence of overcoming the ""barrier function"" of the stratum corneum in order to target the viable epidermis in sufficient levels to be able to elicit such effects.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficiency of oral premedication with Aceclofenac (immediate release and controlled release) in the management of post-instrumentation pain in root canal treatment, in patients with moderate to severe preoperative pain.<h4>Methods</h4>Three-arm parallel, triple blinded randomized controlled trial was planned. Patients with moderate to severe endodontic pain, requiring primary endodontic treatment were enrolled. Aceclofenac 100mg- immediate release (Aceclofenac-IR), Aceclofenac 200mg- controlled release (Aceclofenac-CR), and Ibuprofen 400mg were compared. The tablets were given one hour before the root canal treatment. Postoperatively, patients rated their pain at various time points. The duration of pain relief (primary outcome), the intensity of post-instrumentation pain, and the need for additional medicine were calculated. Statistical analysis was done using Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn post-hoc, Chi-square tests, and Binominal logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>Aceclofenac-CR had a statistically significant longest duration of pain relief when compared to Ibuprofen (p=0.037) and Aceclofenac-IR (p=0.026).

Infe-rior alveolar nerve blocks are eight times more likely to fail in patients with irreversible pulpitis. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of lignocaine with and without pre-operative oral ibuprofen for controlling pain in primary mandibular molars scheduled for pulpectomy procedures in 5 to 9-year-old children.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and twenty-two children diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis in mandibular posterior teeth and scheduled for pulpectomy procedures were included. The children were assigned to one of the two groups, Treatment group A: Pre-operative with oral ibuprofen and local anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine (with adrenaline 1: 80000); Treatment group B: Pre-operative with oral placebo and local anaesthesia with 2% ligno-caine (with 1: 80000 adrenaline). Pain and pulse rate were recorded at baseline, one hour after administration of oral medication, fifteen minutes following administration of Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block (IANB), and also during the course pulpectomy. The results were statistically analysed using chi square test and repeated mea-sures analysis of variance (ANOVA).<h4>Results</h4>In treatment group A, 90.16% children had IANB success compared to 9.83% in group B.. The differ-ence in the success rate between two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001) with an odds ratio of 84.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Oral medication with ibuprofen is effective in increasing the success rate of IANB with lignocaine for the treatment of irreversible pulpitis of 5 to 9-year-old children.",2024,,"Gandhi Z, Nagaraj Gowda SH.",https://doi.org/10.14744/eej.2023.18480,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We hypothesized that obese individuals would have greater indices of inflammation compared with lean controls, and that cyclooxygenase inhibition using ibuprofen would reduce muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and increase forearm blood flow in these subjects. We measured MSNA, inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and Interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and forearm vasodilator responses to brachial artery acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside in 13 men and women (7 lean; 6 obese) on two separate study days: control (CON) and after 800 mg ibuprofen (IBU). CRP (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 0.6 ± 0.3 mg/L; P < 0.05) and IL-6 (4.1 ± 1.5 vs. 1.0 ± 0.1pg/mL; P < 0.05) were higher in the obese group during CON and tended to decrease with IBU (IL-6: P < 0.05; CRP: P = 0.14). MSNA was not different between groups during CON (26 ± 4 bursts/100 heart beats (lean) versus 26 ± 4 bursts/100 heart beats (obese); P = 0.50) or IBU (25 ± 4 bursts/100 heart beats (lean) versus 30 ± 5 bursts/100 heart beats (obese); P = 0.25), and was not altered by IBU. Forearm vasodilator responses were unaffected by IBU in both groups.

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a stress signalling transcription factor that regulates acute and chronic states of inflammation. The classical NF-κB pathway regulates the early activation of post-exercise inflammation; however there remains scope for this complex transcription factor to play a more detailed role in post-exercise muscle recovery. Sixteen volunteers completed a bout of lower body resistance exercise with the ingestion of three 400 mg doses of ibuprofen or a placebo control. Muscle biopsy samples were obtained prior to exercise and at 0, 3 and 24 h post-exercise and analysed for key markers of NF-κB activity. Phosphorylated p65 protein expression and p65 inflammatory target genes were elevated immediately post-exercise independent of the two treatments. These changes did not translate to an increase in p65 DNA binding activity. NF-κB p50 protein expression and NF-κB p50 binding activity were lower than pre-exercise at 0 and 3 h post-exercise, but were elevated at 24 h post-exercise. These findings provide novel evidence that two distinct NF-κB pathways are active in skeletal muscle after resistance exercise. The initial wave of activity involving p65 resembles the classical pathway and is associated with the onset of an acute inflammatory response. The second wave of NF-κB activity comprises the p50 subunit, which has been previously shown to resolve an acute inflammatory program. The current study showed no effect of the ibuprofen treatment on markers of the NF-κB pathway, however examination of the within group effects of the exercise protocol suggests that this pathway warrants further research.",2014,,"Vella L, Markworth JF, Peake JM, Snow RJ, Cameron-Smith D, Russell AP.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.14814/phy2.12172,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, there is no evidence for its use after ambulatory surgery. Our aim was to test whether auricular acupuncture is better than invasive needle control for complementary analgesia after ambulatory knee surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and twenty patients undergoing ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery under standardized general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive auricular acupuncture or a control procedure. Fixed indwelling acupuncture needles were inserted before surgery and retained in situ until the following morning. Postoperative rescue analgesia was directed to achieve pain intensity less than 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative requirement for ibuprofen between surgery and examination the following morning.<h4>Results</h4>Intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients from the control group (n = 59) required more ibuprofen than patients from the auricular acupuncture group (n = 61): median (interquartile range) 600 (200-800) v. 200 (0-600) mg (p = 0.012). Pain intensity on a visual analogue scale was similar in both groups at all time points registered.

With the melting temperature-membrane transport model, the flux ratio of enantiomer/racemate was calculated from their thermodynamic properties obtained by differential scanning calorimetry. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) study was performed to evaluate the interaction between the enantiomers and the SC. New fluorescent probes were designed and utilized in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) study for visualization of the enantioselective permeation of the enantiomers through the intact rabbit skin.<h4>Result</h4>The flux of (S)-ibuprofen through normal skin was significantly higher than that of (RS)-ibuprofen and (R)-ibuprofen (p < 0.05), whereas in damaged skin, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). The predicted flux ratio of (S)-ibuprofen/(RS)-ibuprofen (2.50) was in close agreement with the experimentally determined ratio (2.48). These results were supported by ATR-FTIR and CLSM studies that indicated that a chiral environment of the skin led to the enantioselective permeation of enantiomers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The chiral nature of the SC and the different physicochemical properties of the enantiomers should be taken into account in the assessment of different skin permeability of the racemate and enantiomers.

MED,28959339,28959339,10.15171/ijb.1223,Removal of Pharmaceutical Products in a Constructed Wetland.,"<h4>Background</h4>There is growing interest in the natural and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. While nutrient removal in wetlands has been extensively investigated, information regarding the degradation of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has only recently been emerging. PPCPs are widely distributed in urban wastewaters and can be removed to some extent by the constructed wetlands. The medium-term (3-5 years) behavior of these systems regarding PPCP removal is still unknown.<h4>Objectives</h4>The efficiency of a Leca-based laboratory-scale constructed wetland planted with <i>Phragmites australis</i> (Cav.) Trin. Ex. Steudel in treating an aqueous solution of the pharmaceuticals, namely, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine, was to investigate.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The two pilot-scale constructed wetlands (CW) were operated in parallel; one as an experimental unit (a planted reactor with <i>P. australis</i>) and the other as a control (an unplanted reactor with Leca). Pretreatment and analyses of the carbamazepine, ibuprofen, sulfadiazine, and tissue samples (Leca, <i>P. australis</i> body and <i>P.australis</i> leaf) were conducted using HPLC.<h4>Results</h4>The carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine removal efficiencies for the planted and unplanted reactors were 89.23% and 95.94%, 89.50% and 94.73%, and 67.20% and 93.68%, respectively. The Leca bed permitted an efficient removal. Leca has a high sorption capacity for these pharmaceuticals, with removal efficiencies of 93.68-95.94% in the unplanted reactors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sorption processes might be of a major importance in achieving efficient treatment of wastewater, particularly in the removal of organic material that are resistant to biodegradation, in which case the materials composing the support matrix may play an important role. The results obtained in the present study indicate that a constructed wetland with Leca as a substrate and planted with <i>P. australis</i> is effective in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and sulfadiazine.",2016,,"Özengin N, Elmaci A.",https://doi.org/10.15171/ijb.1223,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, it remains unclear whether opioid analgesia would enhance the opioid rewarding effect thereby contributing to opioid rewarding. Utilizing a rat paradigm of conditioned place preference (CPP) combined with ankle monoarthritis as a condition of persistent nociception, we showed that analgesia induced by either morphine or the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen increased CPP scores in arthritic rats, suggesting that analgesia itself had a rewarding effect. However, arthritic rats exhibited a significantly higher CPP score in response to morphine than ibuprofen. Thus, the rewarding effect of morphine was enhanced in the presence of persistent nociception, producing a phenomenon of analgesia-enhanced opioid reward. At the cellular level, administration of morphine activated a cascade of leptin expression, glial activation, and dopamine receptor upregulation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), while administration of ibuprofen decreased glial activation with no effect on leptin expression in the NAc. Furthermore, the morphine rewarding effect was blocked in leptin deficient ob/ob mice or by neutralizing leptin or interleukin-1β in the NAc without diminishing morphine analgesia. The data indicate that systemic opioid can activate a leptin-mediated central mechanism in the NAc that led to the enhanced opioid rewarding effect. These findings provide evidence for an interaction between opioid analgesia and opioid rewarding, which may have implications in clinical opioid dose escalation in chronic pain management.",2014,,"Lim G, Kim H, McCabe MF, Chou CW, Wang S, Chen LL, Marota JJ, Blood A, Breiter HC, Mao J.",https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0386-14.2014,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This contrasts with most other common oral irritants, such as cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin, and alcohol, which irritate mucus membranes throughout the oral cavity. Here, we show that this rare irritation pattern is a consequence of both the specificity of oleocanthal for a single sensory receptor and the anatomical restriction of this sensory receptor to the pharynx, within the oral cavity. We demonstrate, in vitro, that oleocanthal selectively activates the hTRPA1 channel in HEK 293 cells and that its ability to excite the trigeminal nervous system in rodents requires a functional TRPA1. Moreover, we similarly demonstrate that the over-the-counter analgesic, ibuprofen, which elicits the same restricted pharyngeal irritation as oleocanthal, also specifically excites rodent sensory neurons via TRPA1. Using human sensory psychophysical studies and immunohistochemical TRPA1 analyses of human oral and nasal tissues, we observe an overlap of the anatomical distribution of TRPA1 and the regions irritated by oleocanthal in humans. These results suggest that a TRPA1 (ANKTM1) gene product mediates the tissue sensitivity to oleocanthal within the oral cavity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite the fact that oleocanthal possesses the classic electrophilic reactivity of many TRPA1 agonists, it does not use the previously identified activation mechanism via covalent cysteine modification. These findings provide an anatomical and molecular explanation for a distinct oral sensation that is elicited by oleocanthal and ibuprofen and that is commonly experienced around the world when consuming many extra-virgin olive oils.",2011,,"Peyrot des Gachons C, Uchida K, Bryant B, Shima A, Sperry JB, Dankulich-Nagrudny L, Tominaga M, Smith AB, Beauchamp GK, Breslin PA.",http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/3/999,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Pharmacological characterization of this behavior has implicated the spinal release of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and cyclooxygenase (COX) products. To address this hypothesis, we examined the effect of paw formalin injection on release of EAAs and prostaglandin E2-like immunoreactivity (PGE2-LI) from the spinal cord in unanesthetized rats using a dialysis probe placed in the lumbar subarachnoid space. To assess the contribution of spinal COX products, the effects of S(+)- and R(-)-ibuprofen (active and inactive COX inhibitors) were examined. Paw formalin injection evoked a biphasic spinal release of PGE2-LI with an increase above resting concentrations of 110% in the 0-10 min sample, and of 83% in the 20-30 min sample. Significantly increased release of glutamate (Glu; 110%) and aspartate (Asp; 112%) was only observed in the 0-10 min sample. Saline injection into the paw had no effect on behavior, PGE2-LI, or EAA release. Intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg, S(+)-ibuprofen reduced paw flinching, blocked the elevated levels of PGE2-LI, and suppressed Glu and Asp release to 50% of control. Intrathecal delivery of 10 micrograms, but not 1 microgram, S(+)-ibuprofen also suppressed formalin-induced behavior, PGE2-LI, Glu, and Asp release. R(-)-ibuprofen showed no effect on formalin-induced behaviors or spinal release. These data demonstrate that paw formalin injection produces spinal release of PGE2-LI corresponding to the biphasic behavioral response and that the evoked release is blocked by antinociceptive doses of COX inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,,"Malmberg AB, Yaksh TL.",https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.15-04-02768.1995,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We considered that these dynorphin actions are mediated by a cascade involving the spinal release of excitatory amino acids and prostaglandins. Unanesthetized rats with lumbar intrathecal injection and loop dialysis probes received intrathecal NMDA, dynorphin A(1-17), or dynorphin A(2-17). These agents elicited an acute release of glutamate, aspartate, and taurine but not serine. The dynorphin peptides and NMDA also elicited a long-lasting spinal release of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin release evoked by dynorphin A(2-17) or NMDA was blocked by the NMDA antagonist amino-5-phosphonovalerate as well the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen. To identify the COX isozyme contributing to this release, SC 58236, a COX-2 inhibitor, was given and found to reduce prostaglandin E2 release evoked by either agent. Unexpectedly, the COX-1 inhibitor SC 58560 also reduced dynorphin A(2-17)-induced, but not NMDA-induced, release of prostaglandin E2. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which elevated levels of spinal dynorphin seen in pathological conditions may produce hyperalgesia through the release of excitatory amino acids and in part by the activation of a constitutive spinal COX-1 and -2 cascade.",2004,,"Koetzner L, Hua XY, Lai J, Porreca F, Yaksh T.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/24/6/1451.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Co-injection of three structurally distinct agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), including the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione troglitazone, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen, and the prostanoid 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) prostaglandin J(2), reduced both iNOS expression and cell death, whereas co-injection of the selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor NS-398 had no effect.

Epidemiological studies suggest reduced AD risk associates with long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Whereas chronic ibuprofen suppressed inflammation and plaque-related pathology in an Alzheimer transgenic APPSw mouse model (Tg2576), excessive use of NSAIDs targeting cyclooxygenase I can cause gastrointestinal, liver, and renal toxicity. One alternative NSAID is curcumin, derived from the curry spice turmeric. Curcumin has an extensive history as a food additive and herbal medicine in India and is also a potent polyphenolic antioxidant. To evaluate whether it could affect Alzheimer-like pathology in the APPSw mice, we tested a low (160 ppm) and a high dose of dietary curcumin (5000 ppm) on inflammation, oxidative damage, and plaque pathology. Low and high doses of curcumin significantly lowered oxidized proteins and interleukin-1beta, a proinflammatory cytokine elevated in the brains of these mice. With low-dose but not high-dose curcumin treatment, the astrocytic marker GFAP was reduced, and insoluble beta-amyloid (Abeta), soluble Abeta, and plaque burden were significantly decreased by 43-50%.

This reduction was associated with a dramatic increase in the number of microglia expressing major histocompatibility complex-II antigen, a marker for microglial activation. In contrast, ibuprofen at 375 ppm in diet caused modest reductions in Abeta load but not Congo red staining, suggesting that the effects of this nonselective NSAID were restricted primarily to nonfibrillar deposits. We detected no effects of the cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAID celecoxib at 175 ppm on amyloid deposition. In short-term studies of 12-month-old Tg mice, we found that the microglia-activating properties of NCX-2216 (7.5 mg small middle dot kg(-1) small middle dot d(-1), s.c.) were present after 2 weeks of treatment. Microglia were not activated by NCX-2216 in non-Tg mice lacking Abeta deposits, nor were microglia activated in Tg animals by flurbiprofen (5 mg small middle dot kg(-1) small middle dot d(-1)) alone. These data are consistent with the argument that activated microglia can clear Abeta deposits. We conclude that the NO-generating component of NCX-2216 confers biological actions that go beyond those of typical NSAIDs.

The inhibitory action of ibuprofen and indomethacin was suppressed by PPARgamma antagonists. Finally, we observed that the mRNA levels, expression, and enzymatic activity of beta-secretase were increased by immunostimulation and normalized by NSAIDs. In conclusion, proinflammatory cytokines activate beta-secretase, and NSAIDs inhibit this effect through PPARgamma.",2003,,"Sastre M, Dewachter I, Landreth GE, Willson TM, Klockgether T, van Leuven F, Heneka MT.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/23/30/9796.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The growth inhibitions from CNS myelin and astroglial chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans partially account for the lack of CNS repair. Here, we show that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen and indomethacin, the drugs widely used as pain relievers in the clinic, can surmount axon growth restrictions from myelin and proteoglycans by potently inhibiting their downstream pathway RhoA signal. Similar to Rho and Rock inhibitors C3 transferase or Y27632 [(R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide], both NSAID drugs stimulate a significant neurite growth in the cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to the inhibitory substrates. Systemic administration of ibuprofen to spinal cord-lesioned rodents reverses the active RhoA signal around injury area measured via Rho-GTP binding assay. Subcutaneous injections of ibuprofen via minipumps to rats with a thoracic spinal cord transection or contusion injury result in substantial corticospinal and serotonergic axon sprouting in the caudal spinal cord and promote locomotor functional recovery, even delaying the treatment 1 week after trauma. In contrast, the non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have the axon growth-promoting effects on cultured or lesioned neurons. These studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs in treating CNS injuries characterized by axonal disconnection including spinal cord injury.",2007,,"Fu Q, Hue J, Li S.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/27/15/4154.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,20089905,20089905,10.1523/jneurosci.5045-09.2010,A molecular mechanism for ibuprofen-mediated RhoA inhibition in neurons.,"Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used to relieve pain and inflammation in many disorders via inhibition of cyclooxygenases. Recently, we have demonstrated that ibuprofen inhibits intracellular signaling of RhoA and promotes significant axonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. In addition, another study suggests that ibuprofen reduces generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signaling, although it may also regulate amyloid-beta42 formation by direct inhibition of the gamma-secretase complex. The molecular mechanisms by which ibuprofen inhibits the RhoA signal in neurons, however, remain unclear. Here, we report that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is essential for coupling ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition and subsequent neurite growth promotion in neurons. Ibuprofen activates PPARgamma in neuron-like PC12 and B104 cells. Activation of PPARgamma with traditional agonists mimics the RhoA-inhibiting properties of ibuprofen in PC12 cells and, like ibuprofen, promotes neurite elongation in primary cultured neurons exposed to axonal growth inhibitors. Protein knockdown with small interfering RNA specific for PPARgamma blocks RhoA suppression of PPARgamma agonists in PC12 cells. Moreover, the effect of ibuprofen on RhoA activity and neurite growth in neuronal cultures is prevented by selective PPARgamma inhibition. These findings support that PPARgamma plays an essential role in mediating the RhoA-inhibiting effect of ibuprofen. Elucidation of the novel molecular mechanisms linking ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition may provide additional therapeutic targets to the disorders characterized by RhoA activation, including spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's disease.",2010,,"Dill J, Patel AR, Yang XL, Bachoo R, Powell CM, Li S.",http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/30/3/963.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Keratinocytes, which occupy much of the skin epidermis, are situated at the interface between the external environment and the body's internal milieu, and have long been appreciated for their barrier function against external insults. The recent discovery of temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) ion channels in keratinocytes has raised the possibility that these cells also actively participate in acute temperature and pain sensation. To address this notion, we generated and characterized transgenic mice that overexpress TRPV3 in epidermal keratinocytes under the control of the keratin 14 promoter. Compared with wild-type controls, keratinocytes overexpressing TRPV3 exhibited larger currents as well as augmented prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release in response to two TRPV3 agonists, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) and heat. Thermal selection behavior and heat-evoked withdrawal behavior of naive mice overexpressing TRPV3 were not consistently altered. Upon selective pharmacological inhibition of TRPV1 with JNJ-17203212 [corrected], however, the keratinocyte-specific TRPV3 transgenic mice showed increased escape responses to noxious heat relative to their wild-type littermates. Coadministration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, with the TRPV1 antagonist decreased inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia in transgenic but not wild-type animals. Our results reveal a previously undescribed mechanism for keratinocyte participation in thermal pain transduction through keratinocyte TRPV3 ion channels and the intercellular messenger PGE(2).",2008,,"Huang SM, Lee H, Chung MK, Park U, Yu YY, Bradshaw HB, Coulombe PA, Walker JM, Caterina MJ.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/28/51/13727.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, because of the huge combinatorial space of targets and potential compounds, traditional chemical screens cannot be applied systematically to find probes for all possible druggable targets. Here, we demonstrate a novel concept for overcoming this challenge by leveraging high-throughput metabolomics and overexpression to predict drug-target interactions. The metabolome profiles of yeast treated with 1,280 compounds from a chemical library were collected and compared with those of inducible yeast membrane protein overexpression strains. By matching metabolome profiles, we predicted which small molecules targeted which signaling systems and recovered known interactions. Drug-target predictions were generated across the 86 genes studied, including for difficult to study membrane proteins.

Workup was initiated, and a diagnosis of central precocious puberty was confirmed. A decision was made to initiate pubertal blockade using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) therapy with depot leuprolide acetate injections every 3 months. The patient received the first depot leuprolide acetate injection in the right ventrogluteal area. Six hours following the injection, the patient was reported to be inconsolable in pain, which was localized to the right hip site of the earlier injection and associated with a refusal to ambulate. The pain and discomfort continued to progress over the next 24 h despite an alternating regimen of Tylenol and ibuprofen prompting admission to the emergency department. Vital signs demonstrated a low-grade fever and elevated C-reactive protein. An ultrasound of the right hip demonstrated fluid accumulation within the joint. Over the next week, the patient was unable to walk independently and required assistance for activities of daily living. By 2 weeks after the injection, the pain began to remit, and the patient resumed activities of daily living. Following consultation with allergy, a decision was made to continue GnRHa suppressive therapy with an alternative analog (Triptodur). The patient tolerated subsequent treatment without reaction.<h4>Learning points</h4>Although gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have a generally good safety profile, there is a history of both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions associated with their use. Despite the long-acting formulation of depot leuprolide acetate, the systemic reaction in this case appears to be self-limited. Discontinuation of therapy or a change to an alternative formulation of GnRHa analog should be considered based on the need for therapy versus the potential risk of rechallenge.",2024,,"Steen EA, Phillips SA.",https://doi.org/10.1530/edm-24-0031,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The drug provocation test (DPT) is contraindicated in such situations, due to the risk of triggering a new severe reaction. As a consequence, lifelong avoidance is recommended. However, causation is uncertain in most cases. The dilemma arises when avoiding the drug is not harmless for the patient. We have attended three patients who were referred to our pediatric allergy unit with a history of SCAR related in time to simultaneous use of paracetamol and ibuprofen. Medical records and images of the patients were reviewed with the assistance of a dermatologist, and alternative diagnoses were considered in both cases.

A previous analysis of colorectal tumors revealed that overexpression of splice variant Rac1b occurs in around 80% of tumors with mutant BRAF and both events proved to cooperate in tumor cell survival. Here, we provide evidence for increased expression of Rac1b in patients with inflamed human colonic mucosa as well as following experimentally induced colitis in mice. The increase of Rac1b in the mouse model was specifically prevented by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, which also inhibited Rac1b expression in cultured HT29 colorectal tumor cells through a cyclooxygenase inhibition.independent mechanism. Accordingly, the presence of ibuprofen led to a reduction of HT29 cell survival in vitro and inhibited Rac1b-dependent tumor growth of HT29 xenografts. Together, our results suggest that stromal cues, namely, inflammation, can trigger changes in Rac1b expression in the colon and identify ibuprofen as a highly specific and efficient inhibitor of Rac1b overexpression in colorectal tumors.

Drug discovery and delivery to retard the degeneration of joint tissues are challenging. Current treatment of different types of arthritis such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis involves the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, diclofenac, aceclofenac, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, indomethacin piroxicam, dexibuprofen, ketoprofen, nabumetone, nimesulide, and naproxen, mainly by the oral, parenteral, or topical route.

MED,21903019,21903019,10.18433/j3160b,A new vesicle-loaded hydrogel system suitable for topical applications: preparation and characterization.,"PURPOSE. Aim of this research was to prepare and study drug release from a new formulation consisting of non ionic surfactant vesicular structures, niosomes (NSVs), loaded with model molecules calcein (CALC), nile red (NR), ibuprofen (IBU) or caffeine (CAFF), and embedded in a hydrogel matrix. METHODS. The system locust bean gum/xanthan (1:1), prepared at 60 °C, was used to entrap the vesicles (Tween 20/cholesterol 1:1), loaded with guest molecules and the release profiles were detected at 32 °C. The hydrogel systems were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy; niosomes were characterized by means of size and -potential measurements. RESULTS. Size measurements showed that a slight increase in vesicle dimensions occurs after inclusion of CALC or CAFF (hydrophilic molecules) in the vesicular structures. -potential measurements showed that the inclusion of these molecules did not significantly modify the surface charge of empty vesicles. This was probably related to an almost negligible drug adsorption on the vesicle surface. The release from the niosomes-gel systems of two probes (CALC and NR) showed that the diffusion of CALC through the gel was not affected by the niosome entrapment while for NR, the presence of vesicles was crucial. The release profiles from niosomes-gel systems and from the hydrogel alone of model drugs, CAFF and IBU, showed an appreciable difference between the two drugs: the more hydrophilic CAFF was released much faster than IBU. In all release studies turbidity, dimension and -potential analyses indicated that the loaded niosomes were released by the hydrogel matrix without being damaged. CONCLUSIONS. The reported in vitro experiments show the capability of the novel formulation to combine the qualities of both chosen single systems, i.e. the niosomes and the polymeric network. The hydrogel shows a protective effect on vesicle integrity and leads to a slow release of the loaded model molecules from the polysaccharidic system. This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

We found that NSAIDs including celecoxib (CCB) and ibuprofen (IBU) significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity of Hsp90 inhibitors in human multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells expressing high levels of mutant p53 (mutp53) protein and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and reversed Hsp90 inhibitor resistance caused by activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and by up-regulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and P-gp. Inhibition of Akt/mTOR and STAT3 pathways by CCB induced autophagy, which promoted the degradation of mutp53, one of Hsp90 client proteins, and subsequently down-regulated HSF1/Hsps and P-gp. Inhibition of autophagy prevented mutp53 degradation and CCB-induced apoptosis, and inhibition of caspase-3-mediated apoptotic pathway by Z-DEVD-FMK did not completely block CCB-induced cell death in MDR cells, suggesting that autophagic and apoptotic cell death may contribute to CCB-induced cytotoxicity in MDR cells. Furthermore, CCB and IBU suppressed Hsp90 inhibitor-induced HSF1/Hsp70/P-gp activity and mutp53 expression in MDR cells. Our results suggest that NSAIDs can be used as potential Hsp90 inhibitor chemosensitizers and reverse resistance of MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitors via induction of apoptosis and autophagy. These results might enable the use of lower, less toxic doses of Hsp90 inhibitors and facilitate the design of practically applicable, novel combination therapy for the treatment of MDR cancer.",2018,,"Moon HJ, Kim HB, Lee SH, Jeun SE, Kang CD, Kim SH.",https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.24130,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Although the molecular mechanism behind the antitumor properties of NSAIDs has been largely attributed to inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COXs), several studies have shown that the chemopreventive properties of ibuprofen also involve multiple COX-independent effects. One example is its ability to inhibit the alternative splicing event generating RAC1B, which is overexpressed in a specific subset of BRAF-mutated colorectal tumors and sustains cell survival. Here we describe the mechanism by which ibuprofen prevents RAC1B alternative splicing in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line: it leads to decreased translocation of SRPK1 and SRSF1 to the nucleus and is regulated by a WNK1/GSK3β/SRPK1 protein kinase complex. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that ibuprofen does not inhibit the activity of any of the involved kinases but rather promotes disassembly of this regulatory complex, exposing GSK3β serine 9 to inhibitory phosphorylation, namely by AKT, which results in nuclear exclusion of SRPK1 and SRSF1 hypophosphorylation. The data shed new light on the biochemical mechanisms behind ibuprofen's action on alternative spliced RAC1B and may support its use in personalized approaches to CRC therapy or chemoprevention regimens.",2020,,"Gonçalves V, Henriques AFA, Matos P, Jordan P.",https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.27816,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Case presentation: A 37-year-old man with COVID-19 was referred to our department for bilateral visual blurring. He had been treated with ibuprofen for fever and indapamide to treat the uncontrolled blood pressure. After indapamide intake for four days, he started complaining of bilateral visual blurring. On ocular examination, the uncorrected visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/400 OS. Slit-lamp examination revealed shallow anterior chamber. In the patient’s subsequent visit on the next day, he complained of pain and redness in both eyes from the previous night. On ocular examination, the IOP decreased significantly compared to the previous day, 11 mmHg and 12 mmHg in OD and OS respectively. Slit-lamp examination revealed conjunctival injection and inflammatory cells (2+) in the shallow anterior chamber of both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed ciliary body detachment, and B-scan ultrasound showed peripheral shallow choroidal detachment in both eyes. Stopping the indapamide and treatment with oral prednisolone, topical tobramycin dexamethasone and tropicamide phenylephrine eye drops resulted in rapid recovery of the signs and symptoms after 3 days. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: Indapamide intake can induce bilateral shallow anterior chamber, ciliochoroidal detachment in both eyes, and the preexisting hyperinflammation induced by COVID-19 might increase the susceptibility; drug usage and SARS-CoV-2 infection might commonly contribute to the uveitis.

We evaluated upper GI effects of over-the-counter doses of 2 FD ibuprofen products and 1 FD-APAP product.<h4>Methods</h4>In a randomized, placebo-controlled, endoscopist-blinded, 4-way crossover study, 28 healthy subjects received FD ibuprofen 2×200 mg liquid capsules 3 times daily (TID), ibuprofen 2×200 mg tablets TID, FD-APAP 2×500 mg tablets 4 times daily (QID), and placebo 2×500 mg tablets QID for 7 days. The primary end point was gastric mucosal damage assessed by endoscopy using the Lanza scale: 0=normal stomach or proximal duodenum, 1=mucosal hemorrhages only, 2=1 or 2 erosions, 3=numerous (3-10) erosions, and 4=large number of erosions (>10) or ulcer. Secondary end points included duodenal mucosal damage (Lanza scale); gastroduodenal mucosal injury, classified as present (gastric and/or duodenal endoscopy score ≥2) or absent (gastric and/or duodenal endoscopy score <2); and number of hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcers counted separately in the stomach and duodenum.<h4>Results</h4>Significantly greater gastric mucosal injury was observed after treatment with both ibuprofen products vs FD-APAP (<i>p</i><0.0001 and <i>p</i>=0.0095, respectively). FD-APAP showed no difference from placebo (<i>p</i>=0.4794).

New antiplatelet drugs and many other drugs have been developed, but some drugs may have adverse effects on platelet functions.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to establish an evaluation method for evaluating the effect and adverse effect of various drugs on platelet functions.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Human erythroid leukemia (HEL) cells were used after megakaryocytic differentiation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as an alternative to platelets. Drugs were evaluated by changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) mobilization in Fura2-loaded phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced HEL cells. Aspirin and cilostazol were selected as antiplatelet drugs and ibuprofen and sodium valproate as other drugs.<h4>Results</h4>There was a positive correlation between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. Aspirin (5.6-560 µM) and cilostazol (5-10 µM) significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, ibuprofen (8-200 µM) and sodium valproate (50-1,000 µg/mL) also significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the interaction effects of the simultaneous combined use of aspirin and ibuprofen or sodium valproate were evaluated. When the inhibitory effect of aspirin was higher than that of ibuprofen, the effect of aspirin was reduced, whereas when the inhibitory effect of aspirin was lower than that of ibuprofen, the effect of ibuprofen was reduced. The combination of aspirin and sodium valproate synergistically inhibited thrombin-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is possible to induce HEL cells to differentiate into megakaryocytes, which are a useful model for the study of platelet functions, and the quantification of the inhibition of thrombin-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is applicable to the evaluation of the effects of various drugs on platelets.",2016,,"Tada T, Aki K, Oboshi W, Kawazoe K, Yasui T, Hosoi E.",https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S115910,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The optimized IBU-SLNs were characterized by physicochemical parameters and morphology. Then, the optimized IBU-SLNs was incorporated into the gel and characterized for gel properties and rheology and investigated its release in vitro, pharmacokinetics in vivo, rectal irritation and rectal retention time.<h4>Results</h4>The optimized SLNs had an EE of 90.74 ± 1.40%, DL of 11.36 ± 1.20%, MPS of 166.77 ± 2.26 nm, PDI of 0.27 ± 0.08, and ZP of -21.00 ± 0.59 mV.

However, inflammation may lead to life-threatening conditions. The most common treatment of inflammation is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nowadays, the development of safer new NSAIDs is critical as most of the existing NSAIDs have serious adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and cardiotoxicity. In the present study, four compounds as Schiff base derivatives of 7-hydroxy-4-formyl coumarin and 7-methoxy-4-formyl coumarin were designed and synthesized aiming to develop a lead compound that exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and circumvents the side effects of NSAIDs, especially GI toxicity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Lipinski's rule of five was applied for each designed molecule to evaluate the drug-likeness properties. Molecular docking studies were performed using the ligands and the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein to select the best-scored molecule using AutoDock 4.2.6. The molecules were then synthesized and characterized. An in vitro anti-inflammatory assay of the compounds against the COX-2 receptor was realized through a protein denaturation assay.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>All four synthesized ligands passed Lipinski's rule of five and exhibited higher binding free energy compared to the positive standard control (ibuprofen), and the <i>K</i>i values of compounds 5, 7, and 8 were in the nanomolar range. However, only compounds 6 and 7 obtained a higher percentage of inhibition of protein denaturation relative to ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present study suggested that compound 7 may be a lead molecule because this ligand not only exhibited the best computational and experimental results but also exhibited the strongest correlation between the concentration and percentage of protein denaturation (R = 0.986 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.972) with the lowest P-value (0.014).",2022,,"Hamid SJ, Salih T.",https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S364746,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Our aim was to explore the pharmacokinetics (PK), bioequivalence, food effect, and safety of oral ibuprofen sustained-release capsules by two sponsors in healthy volunteers (HVs).<h4>Methods</h4>Two separate randomized, open-label, single-dose, crossover-design studies were conducted: a fasting study (n = 24) and a fed study (n = 24). In each study, HVs were 1:1 divided into two groups (T-R and R-T) and received 0.3-g/capsule ibuprofen with a 3-day washout. The plasma was collected for up to 24 hours at the time point after dosing on Day 1/Day 4.

Fever is known to affect the host-gut microbiota crosstalk. However, the pharmacological mechanism of XQJRG in this regard remains unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>This study utilized a young febrile rat model previously reported by our team and extended the rat body temperature monitoring period following drug administration to explore the differences in efficacy between XQJRG and the commonly used pediatric antipyretic ibuprofen. Subsequently, the colonic contents of rats were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. The short-chain fatty acid content was quantified using high-throughput targeted metabolomics. The expression of short-chain fatty acid receptors and pro-inflammatory genes in the colonic tissue was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.<h4>Results</h4>XQJRG showed a longer antipyretic duration than ibuprofen. XQJRG improved dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in young febrile rats, bringing its flora composition closer to that of normal rats. It significantly increased the relative abundance of <i>s_Phascolarctobacterium_faecium</i> and <i>s_Roseburia_sp</i>. related to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the contents of butyric acid and nonanoic acid and protein levels of SCFAs receptor GPR41. Moreover, XQJRG significantly increased the levels of metabolites with anti-inflammatory effects, reduced the contents of metabolites directly associated with fever, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the colon of young febrile rats to normal levels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>XQJRG exhibited a more stable and persistent antipyretic effect in young febrile rats compared to ibuprofen.

The results demonstrated that 5-HT had no or negligible effect on aggregation but it did potentiate the aggregation response of AA. Similarly, the combination of subeffective concentrations of ADP and AA exhibited noticeable rise in platelet aggregation. Moreover, the observed synergistic effect of AA with 5-HT on platelets was inhibited by different cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, namely ibuprofen and celecoxib, with half maximal inhibitory effect (IC50) values of 18.0 ± 1.8 and 15.6 ± 3.4 μmol/L, respectively. Interestingly, the synergistic effect observed for AA with 5-HT was, also, blocked by the 5-HT receptor blockers cyproheptadine (IC50=22.0 ± 7 μmol/L), ketanserin (IC50=152 ± 23 μmol/L), phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor (U73122; IC50=6.1 ± 0.8 μmol/L), and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor (PD98059; IC50=3.8 ± 0.5 μmol/L). Likewise, the synergism of AA and ADP was, also, attenuated by COX inhibitors (ibuprofen; IC50=20 ± 4 μmol/L and celecoxib; IC50=24 ± 7 μmol/L), PLC inhibitor (U73122; IC50=3.7 ± 0.3 μmol/L), and MAPK inhibitor (PD98059; IC50=2.8 ± 1.1 μmol/L). Our observed data demonstrate that the combination of subthreshold concentrations of agonists amplifies platelet aggregation and that these synergistic effects largely depend on activation of COX/thromboxane A2, receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels, Gq/PLC, and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, our data revealed that inhibition of COX pathways by using both selective and/or non-selective COX inhibitors blocks not only AA metabolism and thromboxane A2 formation, but also its binding to Gq receptors and activation of receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels in platelets. Overall, our results show that PLC and MAPK inhibitors proved to inhibit the synergistic activation of platelets by several/multiple agonists.",2015,,"Khan N, Farooq AD, Sadek B.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=25811,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Carbopol® 940 dispersion neutralized by triethanolamine was employed as a rheology modifier. In some circumstances, menthol and limonene were employed at different concentrations as permeation promoters. All formulae were assessed in vitro using Franz diffusion cell fitted with full-thickness rat skin. This was followed by in vivo evaluation of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the promising formulae and comparison of the effects with that of the commercially available gel.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Among all other formulae, formula G40 (Carbopol® 940-free formula) had a superior ability in transferring ibuprofen topically compared with the reference. Carbopol® 940 significantly decreased the amount of drug transferred from formula G41 through the skin as a result of swelling, gel formation, and reduction in drug thermodynamic activity. Nonetheless, the addition of 10% w/w of menthol and limonene successfully overcame this drawback since, relative to the reference, higher amount of ibuprofen was transferred through the skin. By contrast, these results were relatively comparable to that of formula G40.

Synthesis and characterization of MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS-APTES NPs was carried out using X-ray diffraction measurements, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence emission spectra, UV-1800 spectrophotometer, N5230A vector network analyzer, MDS-6 microwave sample preparation system, and superconducting quantum interference device. In addition to that mentioned above, we also explored many other sides, such as the drug-loading, drug-controlled release efficiency, elect99omagnetic wave thermal effect and photo-thermal effect.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that APTES-modified MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS NPs had 37% high drug-loading capacity and high electromagnetic wave thermal conversion ability and NIR-light thermal conversion ability. In addition, ibuprofen (IBU) release from the MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS-APTES-IBU depends on the electromagnetic wave (2.45 GHz) and 1060 nm NIR light irradiation. After five cycles, the drug-release percentage was 90% and 66% separately, and could be adjusted by the time and cycles times of electromagnetic wave and NIR light irritation. Electromagnetic wave irradiation compared with NIR light irradiation, has a higher drug release rate and better penetration. Therefore, choosing different stimulation methods according to the treatment needs of the disease, we can achieve accurate personalized treatment of the disease.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our findings indicate that multifunctional APTES modified MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS NPs could be used for the first time as a new drug carrier for ""location-timing-quantification"" drug release with magnetic targeting and dual control of NIR light-electromagnetic waves.",2020,,"Peng H, Wang M, Hu C, Guo J.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S267614,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Then, IBU was incorporated into B-BMSF@PEI at the drug:carrier weight ratio of 1:1. The structural features of IBU before and after drug loading were systemically characterized. IBU and B-BMSF@PEI were then subject to in vitro drug release study and wettability analysis. Finally, in vivo pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory pharmacodynamics studies were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of B-BMSF@PEI on improving the oral adsorption of IBU.<h4>Results</h4>The results demonstrated that B-BMSF@PEI was a meso-meso porous silica material with foam appearance.

A nanoemulsion is a transparent mixture of oil, surfactant and water with a very low viscosity, usually the product of its high water content. The present study investigated the modification of nanoemulsions with different hydrocolloid gums, to enhanced drug delivery of ibuprofen. The in vitro characterization of the initial and modified nanoemulsions was also studied.<h4>Methods</h4>A palm kernel oil esters nanoemulsion was modified with different hydrocolloid gums for the topical delivery of ibuprofen. Three different hydrocolloids (gellan gum, xanthan gum, and carrageenan) were selected for use. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed using palm kernel oil esters as the oil, Tween 80 as the surfactant, and water. Nanoemulsions were prepared by phase inversion composition, and were gradually mixed with the freshly prepared hydrocolloids. The initial nanoemulsion and modified nanoemulsions were characterized. The abilities of the nanoemulsions to deliver ibuprofen were assessed in vitro, using a Franz diffusion cell fitted with rat skin.<h4>Results</h4>No significant changes were observed in droplet size (~16-20 nm) but a significant difference in polydispersity indexes were observed before and after the modification of nanoemulsions using gellan gum, carrageenan, and xanthan gum. The zeta potentials of the initial nanoemulsions (-11.0 mV) increased to -19.6 mV, -13.9 mV, and -41.9 mV, respectively. The abilities of both the initial nanoemulsion (T802) and the modified nanoemulsion to deliver ibuprofen through the skin were evaluated in vitro, using Franz diffusion cells fitted with rat skin. The in vitro permeation data showed that the modified nanoemulsion (Kp value of 55.4 × 10(-3) cm · h(-1)) increased the permeability of ibuprofen 4.40 times over T802 (Kp value of 12.6 × 10(-3) cm · h(-1)) (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The modified nanoemulsion may be a promising vehicle to enhance the permeation of ibuprofen for topical delivery.",2012,,"Salim N, Basri M, Rahman MB, Abdullah DK, Basri H.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S34700,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Recently, we demonstrated the antiproliferative effects of ibuprofen on the human gastric cancer cell line MKN-45. However, high doses of ibuprofen were required to elicit these antiproliferative effects in vitro. The present research compared the antiproliferative effects of ibuprofen delivered freely and released by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) in MKN-45 cells.<h4>Methods</h4>MKN-45 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells were treated with ibuprofen-loaded PLGA NPs. The proliferation of MKN-45 cells was then assessed by cell counting. The uptake of NPs was imaged by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The release of ibuprofen from ibuprofen-loaded PLGA NPs in the cells was evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.<h4>Results</h4>Dramatic inhibition of cellular proliferation was observed in cells treated with ibuprofen-loaded PLGA NPs versus those treated with free ibuprofen at the same concentration. The localization of NPs was cytoplasmic. The initiation of ibuprofen release was rapid, commencing within 2 hours, and then increased slowly over time, reaching a maximum concentration at 24 hours. The inhibition of proliferation was confirmed to be due to the intracellular release of ibuprofen from the NPs. Using PLGA NPs as carriers, ibuprofen exerted an antiproliferative activity at concentrations > 100 times less than free ibuprofen, suggesting greater efficiency and less cellular toxicity. In addition, when carried by PLGA NPs, ibuprofen more quickly induced the expression of transcripts involved in proliferation and invasiveness processes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen exerted an antiproliferative effect on MKN-45 cells at low concentrations. This effect was achieved using PLGA NPs as carriers of low doses of ibuprofen.",2012,,"Bonelli P, Tuccillo FM, Federico A, Napolitano M, Borrelli A, Melisi D, Rimoli MG, Palaia R, Arra C, Carinci F.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S34723,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,36510619,36510619,10.2147/ijn.s388234,Combined Ibuprofen-Nanoconjugate Micelles with E-Selectin for Effective Sunitinib Anticancer Therapy.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Sunitinib, a first-line therapy with a certain effect, was utilized in the early stages of renal cell carcinoma treatment. However, its clinical toxicity, side effects, and its limited bioavailability, resulted in inadequate clinical therapeutic efficacy. Building neoteric, simple, and safe drug delivery systems with existing drugs offers new options. Therefore, we aimed to construct a micelle to improve the clinical efficacy of sunitinib by reusing ibuprofen.<h4>Methods</h4>We synthesized the sialic acid-poly (ethylene glycol)-ibuprofen (SA-PEG-IBU) amphipathic conjugate in two-step reaction. The SA-PEG-IBU amphiphilic conjugates can form into stable SPI nanomicelles in aqueous solution, which can be further loaded sunitinib (SU) to obtain the SPI/SU system. Following nanomicelle creation, sialic acid exposed to the nanomicelle surface can recognize the overexpressed E-selectin receptor on the membrane of cancer cells to enhance cellular uptake. The properties of morphology, stability, and drug release about the SPI/SU nanomicelles were investigated. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used to assess the cellular uptake efficiency of nanomicelles in vitro. Finally, a xenograft tumor model in nude mice was constructed to investigate the body distribution and tumor suppression of SPI/SU in vivo.<h4>Results</h4>The result showed that SPI nanomicelles exhibited excellent tumor targeting performance and inhibited the migration and invasion of tumor cell in vitro. The SPI nanomicelles can improve the accumulation of drugs in the tumor site that showed effective tumor inhibition in vivo. In addition, H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the SPI/SU nanomicelles had a superior therapeutic effect and lower biotoxicity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SPI/SU nanomicelles displayed excellent anti-tumor ability, and can suppress the metastasis of tumor cell by decreasing the expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 due to the ibuprofen, providing an optimistic clinical application potential by developing a simple but safe drug delivery system.",2022,,"Zeng X, Teng Y, Zhu C, Li Z, Liu T, Sun Y, Han S.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S388234,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Recurrent wound infections and prolonged treatment impose significant economic and psychological burdens, drastically reducing patients' quality of life. Modulating the inflammatory response is a promising strategy to accelerate diabetic wound healing. Ibuprofen (IBU), a widely used anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent, has the potential to promote healing by mitigating excessive inflammation and alleviating wound-associated pain. However, its clinical application is hindered by poor water solubility and a short half-life. Therefore, a controlled and sustained-release system for IBU could enhance its therapeutic efficacy in diabetic wound management.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Here, we present an in situ multi-crosslinked composite hydrogel system that integrates oxidized alginate (OSA), methacryloylated gelatin (GelMA), and an ibuprofen/amino-modified β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (IBU/CD-NH<sub>2</sub>) via ion crosslinking, photocrosslinking, and Schiff-base reactions.<h4>Results</h4>The optimized hydrogel formulation was synthesized at 35°C, with a P/A molar ratio of 2 and an methacrylamide(MA) volume fraction of 20%. Physicochemical and biocompatibility analyses demonstrated that the IBU-loaded composite hydrogel exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, favorable biocompatibility, tunable degradation, and injectability. This system effectively addresses IBU's solubility and absorption challenges while conforming to wounds of varying shapes and sizes, enabling controlled and sustained drug release. Cellular and animal studies confirmed that the hydrogel continuously and uniformly releases IBU, exerting anti-inflammatory effects while promoting angiogenesis and fibroblast migration. This leads to enhanced granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and epidermal regeneration, significantly accelerating wound closure within 14 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By simultaneously suppressing inflammation and stimulating tissue regeneration through controlled IBU release, this hydrogel system offers a highly effective strategy for diabetic wound healing and holds strong potential for clinical application.",2025,,"Li Z, Dong H, Yang S, Wang X, Li Z.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S504924,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The different chemical structures, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and/or COX-2 inhibitors, are taken at all ages and some can be easily obtained over the counter. Vasoactive inflammatory mediators like histamine and leukotriene metabolites can produce local/systemic effects. Responders can be selective (SR), IgE or T-cell mediated, or cross-intolerant (CI). Inhibition of the COX pathway is the common mechanism in CI, with the skin being the most frequent organ involved, followed by the lung and/or the nose. An important number of cases have skin and respiratory involvement, with systemic manifestations ranging from mild to severe anaphylaxis. Among SR, this is the most frequent entity, often being severe. Recent years have seen an increase in reactions involving the skin, with many cases having urticaria and/or angioedema in the absence of chronic urticaria. Aspirin, the classical drug involved, has now been replaced by other NSAIDs, with ibuprofen being the universal culprit. For CI, no in vivo/in vitro diagnostic methods exist and controlled administration is the only option unless the cases evaluated report repetitive and consistent episodes with different NSAIDs. In SR, skin testing (patch and intradermal) with 24-48 reading can be useful, mainly for delayed T-cell responses.

The link between COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD) is being investigated, but more research is needed for a definitive connection.<h4>Methods</h4>Datasets GSE22491 and GSE164805 were selected to screen differentially expressed gene (DEG), and immune infiltration and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the DEG were performed. WGCNA analyzed the DEG and selected the intersection genes. Potential biological functions and signaling pathways were determined, and diagnostic genes were further screened using gene expression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Screening and molecular docking of ibuprofen as a therapeutic target. The effectiveness of ibuprofen was verified by constructing a PD model in vitro, and constructing ""COVID19-PD"" signaling pathway, and exploring the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in PD.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 13 DEG were screened from the GSE36980 and GSE5281 datasets. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEG were mainly associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, etc. After analysis, it is found that ibuprofen alleviates PD symptoms by inhibiting the expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Based on signal pathway construction, the importance of ACE2 in COVID-19-induced PD has been identified. ACE2 is found to have widespread distribution in the brain.

Neutrophils, except unactivated control cells, were activated with 10 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cells were cultured with a range of different concentrations of the A. annua extracts (400-1 μg/mL) and artemisinin (200 and 100 μg/mL) and the supernatants were then tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the concentrations of TNF-α and PGE2. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Positive controls with an inhibitor were assayed in triplicate: chloroquine 2.58 and 5.16 μg/mL for TNF-α, and ibuprofen 400 μg/mL for PGE2. An unsupplemented group was also assessed in triplicate as a baseline control.<h4>Results</h4>Neutrophils were stimulated to an inflammatory state by the addition of LPS. A. annua extract significantly inhibited TNF-α production by activated neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner.

MED,30519083,30519083,10.2147/jpr.s177967,Penetration and efficacy of transdermal NSAIDs in a model of acute joint inflammation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Prescription and OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are ubiquitous treatments for pain and inflammation; however, oral administration of these drugs may produce gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Transdermal (TD) administration of NSAIDs circumvents these adverse events by avoiding the GI tract and, presumably, achieves regional drug levels of therapeutic effect and thereby, fewer off-target complications.<h4>Methods</h4>A drug quantification method was developed for ibuprofen and celecoxib in canine plasma and synovial fluid using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method was employed to evaluate the penetrance of ibuprofen and celecoxib topical formulations in dogs. Effectiveness of these topical NSAID formulations was compared to the equivalent oral drug concentration in a canine sodium-urate model of acute joint inflammation. In this model, pain was quantified using a modified Canine Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire and regional inflammation using joint caliper measurements; the significance of intervention was evaluated using linear mixed models for repeated measures along with Bonferroni corrections.<h4>Results</h4>After seven days of chronic topical administration, Delivra™ (DEL) formulations of ibuprofen and celecoxib generated serum levels of 2.9µg/mL and 220ng/mL and synovial fluid levels of 1.8 µg/mL and 203 ng/mL (respectively). In the canine model of acute inflammation, the overall treatment effects as well as the treatment by time interactions were strongly significant (<i>P</i><0.001) for both drugs. Oral ibuprofen proved uniquely effective at the earliest time point, while all ibuprofen formulations were effective at treating pain at 8.5 and 24.5 hours post-induction. Similarly, all celecoxib formulations (oral and topical) were equally effective at 8.5 and 24.5 hours post-induction.<h4>Conclusion</h4>DEL formulations of ibuprofen and celecoxib successfully introduced these NSAIDs into synovial fluid at concentrations similar to those observed in circulation. Furthermore, these formulations reduced symptoms of pain associated with acute inflammation. Oral and transdermally delivered NSAIDs have similar pain relief effects; therefore, a replacement or combinatorial treatment may provide a more stable pain relief profile.

Most commercially available topical NSAID formulations are clinically effective, but direct comparisons of anti-inflammatory activity including both skin absorption and inhibitory potency are lacking. This study examined the skin absorption of representative commercially available topical diclofenac- and ibuprofen-based formulations along with published potency values to determine formulations with superior anti-inflammatory activity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Cumulative absorption and flux profiles of 12 commercially available topical NSAIDs (6 diclofenac-based and 6 ibuprofen-based) were evaluated in vitro using human skin in static Franz diffusion cells. Each formulation was applied as a single dose. In vitro permeation parameters and published COX-2 inhibition values were used to calculate a modified index of topical anti-inflammatory activity (mITAA).<h4>Results</h4>All diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations permeated human skin in vitro. The rate and degree of absorption differed between diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations and between formulations of the same drug. NSAID concentration within a product was not solely responsible for the permeation flux or degree of absorption. Ibuprofen formulations permeated the skin more rapidly and to a greater degree than diclofenac, but calculated mITAAs were higher for diclofenac.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Diclofenac exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity as measured by the index. Differences beyond drug concentration, including excipients, drug salt form, and dosage form, contribute to differences in absorption and thus in anti-inflammatory activity. Both absorption and COX-2 inhibition potency are important for anti-inflammatory activity, but their priority depends upon the products being compared-with the same NSAID, absorption determines superiority; with different NSAIDs, superiority is determined by the balance between absorption and COX-2 potency.

Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products (NSAIDs) are often the first-choice immediate treatment. This study examined the effect of commercially available and newly developed transdermal NSAID products on the solubility of MSU in a physiologically relevant system, alongside the efficacy of transdermal NSAID delivery.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Drug permeability of 7 commercially available topical NSAID products, alongside 3 newly developed ""Gout Buster"" products, was evaluated in vitro using pig's ear skin in Franz diffusion cells. The standard Franz cell experimental protocol was adapted to include assessment of MSU solubility in phosphate buffered saline for each product. Some materials were also tested via direct solubility studies.<h4>Results</h4>The amount of drug delivered transdermally varied significantly between different formulations, with the best ibuprofen delivery being ~5 times higher than the lowest, and best diclofenac delivery being ~3.5 times higher than the lowest. Changes in formulations and the drug concentration in the product both affected the amount of drug delivered. Overall ibuprofen permeation was higher than diclofenac. The commercially available products showed little or no effect on the MSU solubility (99-103% vs control). The Gout Buster products showed significant improvement in the MSU solubility after permeation through skin (120-126%). Increased sodium levels reduced the solubility of MSU in direct solubility studies.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In these trials, the Gout Buster products showed significantly improved permeation of both ibuprofen and diclofenac over the commercial products at similar drug concentrations, and showed significant improvement for MSU solubility. Increased sodium levels reduced the solubility of MSU and could cause more crystallisation in vivo. Therefore, topical NSAID products with the Gout Buster formulation may have the best likelihood of both reducing inflammation and helping re-dissolve the MSU crystals that cause gout.",2022,,"Hooper MW, He L.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=81789,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In the study reported here, we tested the efficacy of celecoxib, diclofenac, and ibuprofen on preprotachykinin mRNA synthesis, substance P (SP) release, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release, and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCɛ) translocation in rat cultured sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). The efficacy of these NSAIDs was compared with the efficacy of paracetamol and nimesulide in in vitro models of hyperalgesia (investigated previously). While nimesulide and paracetamol, as in previous experiments, decreased the percentage of cultured DRG neurons showing translocation of PKCɛ caused by 100 nM thrombin or 1 μM bradykinin in a dose-dependent manner, the other NSAIDs tested did not have a significant effect. The amount of SP released by peptidergic neurons and the expression level of preprotachykinin mRNA were assessed in basal conditions and after 70 minutes or 36 hours of stimulation with an inflammatory soup (IS) containing potassium chloride, thrombin, bradykinin, and endothelin-1. The release of SP at 70 minutes was inhibited only by nimesulide, while celecoxib and diclofenac were effective at 36 hours. The mRNA basal level of the SP precursor preprotachykinin expressed in DRG neurons was reduced only by nimesulide, while the increased levels expressed during treatment with the IS were significantly reduced by all drugs tested, with the exception of ibuprofen. All drugs were able to decrease basal and IS-stimulated PGE(2) release.

We proposed ""Invigorating Qi and activating Blood"" (IQAB) acupuncture, compared with Fenbid, and local electroacupuncture (LEA), to observe whether it has advantages in the protection of the CSR rat model and to elucidate its mechanism through the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, sham, model, Fenbid, LEA, and IQAB. The CSR model was induced by inserting nylon sutures to compress the C<sub>4</sub>-T<sub>1</sub> nerve root. The Fenbid group was treated with ibuprofen sustained-release capsules (15 mg/kg·d, <i>ig</i>). The LEA group received electroacupuncture at both C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>7</sub> EX-B2 once a day. The IQAB group received acupuncture at both ST36 and BL17 based on the LEA group's intervention. Mechanical allodynia and gait, morphological changes in the spinal cord, IL-6 and TNF-α levels, MAPKs phosphorylation ratio, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in the spinal cord, and the expression of p-p38 in the spinal cord and its colocalization with neurons and glial cell activation markers were detected.<h4>Results</h4>Mechanical allodynia, gait disorder, edema, reduced Nissl-positive cell numbers, and increased IL-6 and TNF-α levels in the spinal cord were observed in CSR rats. IQAB significantly alleviated these changes, and the effects were generally comparable to those of Fenbid. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation ratios of p38 and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), co-expression of p-p38 with neuron/microglia, and MCP-1 levels in the spinal cord were markedly down-regulated by IQAB compared with those in CSR model rats.<h4>Conclusion</h4>IQAB reduced p38-activation-related microglia activation and MCP-1 levels, thus alleviating pathological changes, inflammation levels in the local spinal cord, and pain behavior of CSR.",2023,,"Shi T, Liu Y, Ji B, Wang J, Ge Y, Fang Y, Xie Y, Xiao H, Wu L, Wang Y.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=94480,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Therefore, this study aims to perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of primary dysmenorrhea research to identify hotspots, explore emerging trends, and provide valuable insights for future research endeavors.<h4>Material and methods</h4>All of the relevant studies on primary dysmenorrhea in the Web of Science™ Core Collection database were searched for bibliometric analysis. Biclustering analysis using gCLUTO software was performed to identify research hotspots. Social network analysis with Ucinet was employed to reveal knowledge structure. Evolutionary analysis using SciMAT was utilized to predict thematic trends.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 903 papers were analyzed, indicating a gradual increase in research on primary dysmenorrhea in recent years, with the scope of research expanding and diversifying. We identified seven hotspots, three treatment nodes, and four thematic trends. Research hotspots focused on epidemiological studies, adolescent primary dysmenorrhea, drug and non-drug treatments. Within the realm of treatments, we have identified three treatment nodes: acupuncture, acupressure, and ibuprofen. The evolution of research has witnessed a shift from traditional epidemiological studies toward a more diverse research landscape. Adolescent primary dysmenorrhea is expected to remain a prominent research topic while dietary supplements and lifestyle are predicted to gain more attention. An emerging theme is the study of variation and polymorphism of circadian rhythm genes concerning primary dysmenorrhea.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the current state of research on primary dysmenorrhea, offering a clearer understanding of the field's landscape. The identified hotspots, knowledge structure, and thematic trends can serve as valuable references for future investigations in this area.

Electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective alternative strategy for treating PDM as it regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the exact anti-inflammatory mechanism of EA remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the therapeutic effect of EA on PDM and determined the potential involvement of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/NLRP3 signaling pathway.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>The following pain management interventions were administered to a PDM rat model: saline (control), EA, parecoxib, EA + parecoxib, or ibuprofen. After treatment, the following parameters were examined: torsion behavior; endometrial histopathological morphology and ultrastructure; serum and uterine prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> (PGF<sub>2α</sub>) levels; nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65; and the expression of COX-2, phospho-NF-κBp65. NF-κBp65, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated spec-like protein (ASC), pro-cysteine aspartate-specific protease 1 (pro-caspase-1), cysteine aspartate-specific protease 1 (caspase-1), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-18.<h4>Results</h4>The treatment groups showed considerably reduced pathological uterine injury compared with that of the control. This was associated with decreased PGF<sub>2α</sub> and increased PGE<sub>2</sub> levels. The uterine tissues in the treatment groups showed reduced NF-κBp65 nuclear translocation and a decreasing trend in COX-2, NF-κBp65, phospho-NF-κBp65, NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 protein expression compared with that of the controls. The levels of each protein in the parecoxib and ibuprofen groups did not differ considerably from those in the EA group. Furthermore, EA markedly improved pain symptoms and pathological damage in PDM rats and downregulated the expression of COX-2/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway proteins in uterine tissue.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings demonstrated superior anti-inflammatory effects of EA + parecoxib on COX-2/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway-related proteins compared with that of EA alone or single-drug administration.",2025,,"Xue X, Wang S, Li J, Yuan H, Pan S, Liu X, Yue Z, Liu Y.",https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S512243,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Significant improvement is usually achieved by surgery. However, postoperative pain can be moderate to severe for 2-3 days. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of transdermal fentanyl for postoperative pain management after forefoot surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty patients undergoing hallux valgus or hallux rigidus surgery were allocated to receive a patch delivering either fentanyl 12 μg/hour or placebo for postoperative pain. The consumption of rescue opioid oxycodone, the primary outcome measure, was evaluated daily until the fourth postoperative day. Total consumption of oxycodone during the study period was also assessed. Pain scores and possible adverse effects were evaluated every 6 hours during the first 24 hours and on the fourth postoperative day.<h4>Results</h4>The use of rescue opioid was low in both groups, the median (range) consumption of oxycodone being 10 (0-50) mg on the day of surgery (no difference between the groups, P=0.31) and 0 (0-35) mg thereafter. The total combined consumption was 10 (0-105) mg in the fentanyl group and 20 (0-70) mg in the placebo group (P=0.23).

Treatment guidelines for chronic NSAID therapy include the consideration for gastroprotection for those at risk of gastric ulcers (GUs) associated with the chronic NSAID therapy. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets for the relief of signs and symptoms of OA, RA, and AS, and to decrease the risk of developing GUs in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated GUs. The European Medical Association has approved this therapy for the symptomatic treatment of OA, RA, and AS in patients who are at risk of developing NSAID-associated GUs and/or duodenal ulcers, for whom treatment with lower doses of naproxen or other NSAIDs is not considered sufficient. Naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets have been compared with naproxen and celecoxib for these indications in head-to-head trials. This systematic literature review and network meta-analyses of data from randomized controlled trials was performed to compare naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium tablets with a number of additional relevant comparators.

The mechanism of action of all NSAIDs is through reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) including gastrointestinal bleeding as well as cardiovascular and renal effects have been reported with NSAID use. In many cases, ADRs may occur because of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between the NSAID and a concomitant medication. For example, DDIs have been reported when NSAIDs are coadministered with aspirin, alcohol, some antihypertensives, antidepressants, and other commonly used medications. Because of the pharmacologic nature of these interactions, there is a continuum of risk in that the potential for an ADR is dependent on total drug exposure. Therefore, consideration of dose and duration of NSAID use, as well as the type or class of comedication administered, is important when assessing potential risk for ADRs. Safety findings from clinical studies evaluating prescription-strength NSAIDs may not be directly applicable to OTC dosing. Health care providers can be instrumental in educating patients that using OTC NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest required duration is vital to balancing efficacy and safety.

Despite the known association between NSAID use and gastropathy, however, only around one-third of patients at risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal toxicity receive adequate gastroprotection, and as many as 44% of these patients are non-adherent. We review the co-prescription of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastropathy, with a particular focus on the first fixed-dose NSAID/PPI formulation: ketoprofen/omeprazole modified-release capsules. The ketoprofen/omeprazole fixed-dose combination is available in doses of 100 mg/20 mg, 150 mg/20 mg or 200 mg/20 mg as a single capsule for once-daily administration. Ketoprofen monotherapy has been shown to be generally equivalent to other NSAIDs when used in the treatment of OA. In RA, ketoprofen has demonstrated equivalent efficacy to diclofenac, indometacin, piroxicam, aceclofenac, phenylbutazone, naproxen and flurbiprofen. Studies comparing ketoprofen with ibuprofen and sulindac in patients with RA have, in general, favoured ketoprofen. Studies in AS have generally reported similar efficacy between ketoprofen and phenylbutazone and pirprofen. Prophylaxis with omeprazole is effective for the prevention of gastroduodenal ulcers, maintenance of remission and alleviation of dyspeptic symptoms in NSAID recipients. Omeprazole is well tolerated, and adverse events are generally gastrointestinal in nature. The fixed-dose combination of ketoprofen and omeprazole has demonstrated bioequivalence to the respective monotherapies. The incidence of digestive symptoms and the need for dose reduction was reported to be lower with the combination than with its components. Ketoprofen/omeprazole modified-release capsules are the first fixed-dose NSAID/PPI formulation to be approved. This formulation ensures compliance with the gastroprotective prophylaxis, as whenever the NSAID is taken, the PPI is co-administered. Additionally, the once-daily formulation has the potential to improve adherence to anti-inflammatory therapy.",2012,,"Gigante A, Tagarro I.",https://doi.org/10.2165/11596670-000000000-00000,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this context the removal efficiencies of sewage treatment plants (STPs) are of importance, as their effluents are important point sources for the release of those substances into the aquatic environment. Activated sludge based wastewater treatment is the worldwide prevalently used treatment technique. In conventional plants the separation of treated wastewater and sludge occurs via sedimentation. A new development is the application of membrane technology for this separation step. The studies focus on the influence of the solids retention time (SRT) on the removal efficiency, as the SRT is the most important parameter in the design of STPs. A conventional activated sludge plant (CASP) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR) were operated at different SRTs. The substances selected are the antiepileptic carbamazepine, the analgesics diclofenac and ibuprofen, the lipid regulator bezafibrate, the polycyclic musks tonalide and galaxolide and the contraceptive 17alpha-ethinylestradiole.

Three membrane methods (micro-, ultra-, and nano-filtration), and two advanced oxidations (gamma radiation and electrochemical oxidation) were applied. Best results concerning the removal of pharmaceuticals and hormones from urine by membrane separation were achieved using the membrane NF-200 (FilmTec). Pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen and diclofenac), and hormones (oestrone, beta-oestradiol, ethenyloestradiol, oestriol) were removed completely from urine. NF-separation also has some disadvantages: losses of urea, and lowering the conductivity in the product (permeate). The retentates (concentrates) received have to be treated further by oxidation to destroy the ""problem"" compounds. The results showed that electrochemical oxidation is more suitable than gamma radiation. Gamma-radiation with intensities higher than 10 kGy has to be applied for efficiently destroying of ibuprofen, and especially diclofenac. A high quantity of intermediate ""problem"" substances with oestrone structure was formed during the gamma oxidation of hormone containing urine samples.

Upgrading sewage treatment quality with modern technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs) and/or implementing a further posttreatment might mitigate the release of xenobiotics into surface waters. The performance of two processes treating municipal sewage, a MBR and an Activated Sludge (AS) unit, have been compared in terms of PPCPs removal. Moreover, their effluents were treated using vertical flow reed beds. Both systems were operated under similar conditions, more specifically Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), maintained at 8 hours, and Sludge Retention Time (SRT) set at 6 and 20 days.

Common treatment modalities are usually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, paracetamol, indomethacin and ibuprofen as well as corticosteroids such as prednisone. These however, may be associated with a host of side effects due to non-selectivity for cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes involved in inflammation and those with selectivity may be highly priced. Thus, there is a continuing search for safe and effective antiinflammatory molecules from natural sources. Research has confirmed that iridoids exhibit promising anti-inflammatory activity which may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammation. Iridoids are secondary metabolites present in various plants, especially in species belonging to the Apocynaceae, Lamiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Verbenaceae families. Many of these ethnobotanicals have an illustrious history of traditional use alluding to their use to treat inflammation. Although iridoids exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities such as cardiovascular, hepatoprotection, hypoglycaemic, antimutagenic, antispasmodic, anti-tumour, antiviral, immunomodulation and purgative effects this review will acutely focus on their anti-inflammatory properties. The paper aims to present a summary for the most prominent iridoid-containing plants for which anti-inflammatory activity has been demonstrated in vitro and / or in vivo.",2012,,"Viljoen A, Mncwangi N, Vermaak I.",https://doi.org/10.2174/092986712800229005,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A search of MEDLINE was conducted and articles published in English until December 2003 were included. The results from in vitro and animal experiments as well as from human clinical trials are presented. Non-selective cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors used in periodontal research include compounds such as aspirin, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen and piroxicam. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors represent a new group of pharmaceutical products termed ""coxibs"" that include meloxicam, nimesulide, etodolac and celecoxib. Evidence from animal experiments and clinical trials documents that selective and non-selective NSAIDs are mainly responsible for the stabilization of periodontal conditions by reducing the rate of alveolar bone resorption. This is achieved through local inhibition of both enzymes (e.g. COX-1 and COX-2) responsible for the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites. Evidence shows that the effects of NSAIDs drop off rapidly after drug withdrawal. One of the major advantages of selective COX-2 inhibition is the reduction of adverse systemic effects. Although some studies present promising results, no data from long-term, multicenter prospective clinical trials are yet available for determining whether these therapeutic effects can be retained on a long-term basis. Many of these compounds, such as flurbiprofen, are readily absorbed through the gingival tissues. Therefore, the development of topical NSAIDs formulations (e.g. gels, toothpastes, rinses) with a daily application seems to be of particular interest. This may help to further reduce adverse systemic effects of non-selective NSAIDs in the long-term host modulation of periodontitis-susceptible patients.",2005,,"Salvi GE, Lang NP.",https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612053764878,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

These reactions can be IgE dependent (immediate reactions), T cell-mediated (non-immediate), or induced by a non-specific immunological mechanism related with the blocking of the COX-1 enzyme and the shunting to the lipooxygenase pathway (cross-intolerant reactions). Cutaneous symptoms are the most frequent, with ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac being common culprit drugs worldwide, although others can be involved because patterns of consumption and exposure rates vary between countries. A very important proportion of immunological reactions are immediate, with urticaria and anaphylaxis being the typical clinical manifestations. Non-immediate reactions comprise a number of heterogeneous entities ranging from mild exanthema to severe TEN or DRESS syndrome, as well as organ-specific reactions such as hepatitis or pneumonitis. Cross-intolerant reactions appear to non-chemically related drugs, and involve respiratory airways, skin or both. In vivo diagnostic tests are based on the capacity of the skin to respond to the culprit drug, but their sensitivity is in many instances rather low. The approach for in vitro testing consists of either detecting specific IgE antibodies or studying the proliferation of T lymphocytes toward the eliciting drug. No appropriate tests are yet available for the in vitro validation of cross-intolerance reactions, although techniques based on the stimulation of basophils have been proposed. Based on these findings, the diagnostic approach is often based on the controlled administration of the drug to assess tolerance.

Ibuprofen, which shares the same primary albumin binding site with p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, can be infused during hemodialysis to displace these toxins, thereby augmenting their removal.<h4>Design, setting, participants, & measurements</h4>We infused 800 mg ibuprofen into the arterial bloodline between minutes 21 and 40 of a conventional 4-hour high-flux hemodialysis treatment. We measured arterial, venous, and dialysate outlet concentrations of indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, tryptophan, ibuprofen, urea, and creatinine before, during, and after the ibuprofen infusion. We report clearances of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate before and during ibuprofen infusion and dialysate concentrations of protein-bound uremic toxins normalized to each patient's average preinfusion concentrations.<h4>Results</h4>We studied 18 patients on maintenance hemodialysis: age 36±11 years old, ten women, and mean vintage of 37±37 months. Compared with during the preinfusion period, the median (interquartile range) clearances of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate increased during ibuprofen infusion from 6.0 (6.5) to 20.2 (27.1) ml/min and from 4.4 (6.7) to 14.9 (27.1) ml/min (each <i>P</i><0.001), respectively.

The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, Na-salicylate and Na-acetylsalicylate, potentiated glucose-induced insulin release, despite a decrease in Ca influx evidenced by inhibition of the Ca-dependent electrical activity in beta-cells and 45Ca efflux from islets perifused with a medium containing Ca. This paradox can probably be explained by a mobilization of intracellular Ca (acceleration of 45Ca efflux in the absence of Ca) with subsequent activation of K+ channels (acceleration of 86Rb efflux) and repolarization of the membrane. These effects of salicylate could not be ascribed to a change in intracellular pH because they were not mimicked by 2-Cl-benzoate, which has a similar pK as salicylate but increased insulin release by stimulating Ca influx in beta-cells. Among the other cyclooxygenase inhibitors tested, indomethacin caused a slight potentiation of insulin release accompanied by marginal increases in 45Ca efflux and electrical activity, whereas flurbiprofen and ibuprofen were ineffective.

Oleocanthal (OO), one of the most potent bioactive phenols of extra virgin olive oil, has shown redox modulating properties in vitro. However, its acute, in vivo antioxidant properties have never been studied before.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of five redox markers (Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS] and glutathione peroxidase activity in serum-GPx3 and erythrocytes (GPx1), protein carbonyls in serum) after the consumption different meals.<h4>Design</h4>Five different isocaloric meals comprised of white bread and butter (BU) or butter plus ibuprofen (BU-IBU) or olive oil poor in OO or olive oils containing 250 and 500 mg/Kg of oleocanthal (OO250 and OO500, respectively). We hypothesized that OO-rich olive oil will reduce postprandial oxidative stress in T2DM patients compared to other lipid sources. This study involved 10 patients with T2DM and had a cross-over design.<h4>Results</h4>The comparison of incremental Area Under Curves (iAUCs) has shown that OO-rich olive oils were able to alleviate the increments of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and GPx3 and induce a higher red blood cells (RBCs) GPx1 activity compared to OO (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The effect was dose and redox marker depended. Correlation analysis in the pooled sample demonstrated a positive association between postprandial ex vivo platelet sensitivity to ADP and iAUC TBARS. In conclusion, our study has shown that OO-rich olive oils can favorably modulate lipid peroxidation and RBC GPx activity in T2DM patients when consumed as part of a carbohydrate meal.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study demonstrates for the first time that, apart from its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties, OO can also exert acute antioxidant effects.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This finding emphasizes the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil, particularly those with a high OO content, for T2DM patients.",2024,,"Katsa ME, Gil APR, Makri EM, Papadogiannis S, Ioannidis A, Kalliostra M, Ketselidi K, Diamantakos P, Melliou E, Magiatis P, Nomikos T.",https://doi.org/10.29219/fnr.v68.10882,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The present study focuses on the efficiency of vitamin E TPGS/HPMC supersaturated solution and other solubilizer/polymer systems to improve the solubility of the drug and inhibit crystal growth in the transdermal formulation. Effect of several solubilizers, for example, Pluronic F-127, vitamin E TPGS and co-solvent, for example, propylene glycol (PG) were studied on the supersaturated systems of ibuprofen as model drug. Various stabilizers such as hydroxylpropyl methylcellulose (HPMC 3 cps) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K-30) were examined to evaluate their crystal inhibitory effects. Different analytical tools were used in this study to detect the growth of crystals in the systems.

The present study examines the efficacy of S-(+)-ibuprofen on cartilage degradation as drug candidate for DDS loading. Humeral cartilage and joint capsule explants were collected from healthy sheep shoulder joints and they were cultured in mono- or in co-culture for 13 days with LPS in combination with S-(+)-ibuprofen at 50 µM and 1 mM. S-(+)-ibuprofen (50 µM) blocked prostaglandins production in LPS-activated explants but did not reduce cartilage degradation. By contrast, 1 mM S-(+)-ibuprofen treatment of cartilage explants reduced nitric oxide synthesis by 51% (p = 0.0072), proteoglycans degradation by 35% (p = 0.0114) and expression of serum amyloid protein - the main protein induced upon LPS challenge - by 44% (p < 0.0001). On contrary, in presence of synovial membrane, the protective effects of S-(+)-ibuprofen on cartilage damages were significantly diminished. At 1mM, S-(+)-ibuprofen reduced the cell lysis during culture of cartilage and joint capsule either in mono- or in co-culture. This study performed on sheep explants shows that 1 mM S-(+)-ibuprofen inhibited cartilage degradation via a mechanism independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition.

The toxicity of borneol was evaluated in epidermal keratinocyte HaCaT and dermal fibroblast CCC-HSF-1 cell cultures and compared to known enhancers, and its irritant profile was also assessed by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) evaluation. The promoting effect of borneol on the transdermal permeation of five model drugs, namely 5-fluorouracil, antipyrine, aspirin, salicylic acid and ibuprofen, which were selected based on their lipophilicity denoted by logp value, were performed using in vitro skin permeation studies. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was employed to monitor the borneol-induced alteration in molecular organization of SC lipids. The enhancer borneol displayed lower cytotoxicity or irritation in comparison to the well-established and standard enhancer Azone. Borneol could effectively promote the transdermal permeation of five model drugs, and its enhancement ratios were found to be parabolic curve with the logp values of drugs, which exhibited the optimum permeation activity for relatively hydrophilic drugs (an estimated logp value of -0.5 ∼0.5).

In vitro studies suggest that statins and NSAIDs may have potential as anticancer therapies in low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a recent observational study found statin use was associated with improved event free survival in patients with follicular lymphoma. Other studies have suggested that statins reduce the efficacy of rituximab by inhibiting binding to CD20. We therefore conducted an observational cohort study of 686 patients with newly diagnosed Rai stage 0 CLL to evaluate whether statin or NSAID use was related to their clinical outcome or influenced the efficacy of rituximab therapy. At diagnosis, 136 (20%) patients took statins and 230 (34%) scheduled daily aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. No difference in time to treatment was observed based on statin or NSAID use. Among patients receiving a rituximab-containing first-line therapy, no difference in time to salvage treatment was observed based on statin use. Although previous studies suggested statins may improve event free survival among patients with follicular lymphoma, we find no impact of statins on time to initial therapy in this large study of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL.

Clinical trials, on the other hand, have been less positive. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that NSAIDs exert part of their effects by reducing long-term cerebral neuroinflammation, although this mechanism has not been proven. In this study, we report that ibuprofen, one of the more widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, was able to alter the ultrastructure of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and significantly decrease its association to neuronal membranes, and consequently, its synaptotoxic effect in rat primary hippocampal and cortical cultures at 24 h incubation. In agreement with these results, we found that the decrease in the frequency of calcium transients with Aβ was partly recovered by addition of ibuprofen (8.0 × 10-2 Hz in control; 3.4 × 10-2 Hz in 5 μM Aβ, and 5.9 × 10-2 Hz in the presence of Aβ and 200 μM ibuprofen). Additionally, this effect correlated well with the increment and recovery of miniature spontaneous currents (47 ± 5% of control in 1 μM Aβ alone and 104 ± 14% in the presence of Aβ and ibuprofen).

We focused on: 1) optimizing HDL-Abeta preparation for maximal toxicity; 2) evaluating the role of copper, a factor typically in water that can impact oligomer stability; and 3) determining impact of insulin resistance (type II diabetes), a risk factor for AD. In vitro studies were performed to determine doses of copper and methods of Abeta-HDL preparation that maximized toxicity. These preparations when infused resulted in earlier onset of cognitive deficits within 6 weeks post-infusion. Induction of insulin resistance did not exacerbate Abeta-dependent cognitive deficits, but did exacerbate synaptic protein loss. In summary, the newly described in vivo infusion model may be useful cost-effective method for screening for new therapeutic drugs for AD.",2008,,"Begum AN, Yang F, Teng E, Hu S, Jones MR, Rosario ER, Beech W, Hudspeth B, Ubeda OJ, Cole GM, Frautschy SA.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4313743?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The PRISCUS list, published in 2010, was the first catalog of PIM designed for the Germandrug market to become adopted in practice. While 24% of German patients aged ≥ 65 years were prescribed at least one PIMper year in 2009, the proportion in 2019 was only 14.5%.<h4>Methods</h4>In a three-round Delphi process, experts from clinical practice and research evaluated whether selected substancesare PIM for the elderly. The participants were provided with dedicated literature including systematic reviews carried out for theparticular purposes of this project.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-nine persons took part in the Delphi process and, in addition, contributed comments and therapeutic alternatives.Altogether, 187 substances were classed as PIM. One hundred thirty-three of the substances now listed were not in the originalPRISCUS list: these include some oral antidiabetics, all of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, and moderately long acting benzodiazepinessuch as oxazepam. For some other substances, e.g., proton pump inhibitors (PPI), the advisability of treatment formore than 8 weeks was considered as potentially inappropriate, as was the use of ibuprofen in doses >1200 mg/day and formore than 1 week without PPI.

Initially, we developed an initial and advanced stage of the Parkinson disease mouse model by intraperitoneal injection of MPTP (20 mg/kg; 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine) for 10 and 20 days, respectively. Subsequently, ibuprofen treatment was administered for 2 months, and a pole test, rotarod test, histology, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting were performed to determine neuronal motor function. Histological analysis for 10 days after mice were injected with MPTP showed the onset of neurodegeneration and cell aggregation, indicating the initial stages of Parkinson's disease. Advanced Parkinson's disease was marked by Lewy body formation after another 10 days of MPTP injection. Neurodegeneration reverted after ibuprofen therapy in initial Parkinson's disease but not in advanced Parkinson's disease. The pole and rotarod tests confirmed that motor activity in the initial Parkinson disease with ibuprofen treatment recovered (p<0.01). However, no improvement was observed in the ibuprofen-treated mice with advanced disease mice. Interestingly, ibuprofen treatment resulted in a significant improvement (p<0.01) in NURR1 (Nuclear receptor-related 1) expression in mice with early PD, but no substantial improvement was observed in its expression in mice with advanced PD.

Additionally, many attempts have been made to tune hydrophobic/hydrophilic drug release kinetics over time, avoiding the so-called <i>burst release</i>. In this scenario, hydrogels resulting from the assembly of micellar structures showing a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell could represent a promising alternative to design versatile drug vehicles. In this regard, this work aimed at designing new thermosensitive micellar hydrogels starting from a custom-made amphiphilic poly(ether urethane) (PEU). Specifically, a commercial triblock copolymer (Poloxamer<sup>®</sup> 407), selected to ensure the temperature-driven chain arrangement into micelles, was reacted with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. The successful PEU synthesis was proved by size-exclusion chromatography ( M ¯ <sub><i>w</i></sub> 50000 Da) and infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, the wettability-driven drug arrangement within the micelle network as well as the influence of drug-loading on the resultant formulation thermosensitivity was investigated by selecting ibuprofen (IBU) and ibuprofen sodium salt (IBUSS) as hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, respectively. Specifically, growing drug amounts were loaded into PEU solutions, and the average hydrodynamic micelle diameters and the critical micellar temperatures (CMT) were measured. Systems containing IBU at the highest tested concentration (i.e., 20 mg/mL) showed a significantly higher micelle average diameter (58.2 ± 4.7 nm) and a remarkably lower CMT (8.9°C) with respect to both the control (40.1 ± 1.4 nm and 21.6°C) and IBUSS-loaded formulations (37.3 ± 2.1 nm and 22.4°C). Then, the influence of drug encapsulation on the temperature at which micelles begin to aggregate was rheologically assessed, showing that IBU-loading induced a decrease in this parameter (14.6, 8.7, and 13.7°C for virgin, IBU-loaded, and IBUSS-loaded hydrogel, respectively). Finally, IBU and IBUSS releasing mechanism was analysed using the Korsmayer-Peppas model (<i>n</i> value of 0.63 ± 0.007 and 0.89 ± 0.003 for IBU- and IBUSS-loaded gels, respectively). Thanks to their micellar organisation, the here-developed hydrogel platform allowed the encapsulation of a high number of molecules with different wettability.

In this study, we evaluated the <i>in vivo</i> biocompatibility and regenerative potential of a nanoenabled collagen-polylactide (Col-PLA) scaffold functionalized with tri-combinatorial nanoemulsions delivering ibuprofen (anti-inflammatory), batimastat (BB-94, anti-proteolytic), and mupirocin (anti-bacterial). Using a femoral osteochondral defect model in New Zealand White rabbits, regeneration was assessed at 4- and 12-week post-implantation by macroscopic scoring, biomechanical indentation mapping, and histological analysis. Synovial inflammation was further evaluated via histology, CD8 immunostaining, and quantification of key pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Both functionalized and non-functionalized Col-PLA scaffolds supported significant host cell infiltration and tissue regeneration, outperforming untreated controls and demonstrating effective subchondral bone repair. A transient inflammatory response was observed in the nanoenabled group at 4 weeks, without elevation of synovial pro-inflammatory cytokines or compromised tissue regeneration. Although cartilage repair was comparable between scaffold groups, the nanoenabled Col-PLA scaffold might have a potential benefit in more complex or comorbid clinical scenarios due to its immunomodulatory, anti-proteolytic, and anti-microbial functionalization.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches targeting virulence arrays. Our aim is to discover new anti-virulence therapies targeting MRSA and VRSA virulence arrays.<h4>Methodology</h4>We employed phenotypic, molecular docking, and genetic studies to screen for anti-virulence activities among selected promising compounds: Coumarin, Simvastatin, and Ibuprofen.<h4>Results</h4>We found that nearly all detected MRSA and VRSA strains exhibited MDR and multi-virulent profiles. The molecular docking results aligned with the phenotypic and genetic assessments of virulence production. Biofilm and hemolysin productions were inhibited, and all virulence genes were downregulated upon treatment with sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of these promising compounds. Ibuprofen was the most active compound, exhibiting the highest inhibition and downregulation of virulence gene products. Moreover, <i>in vivo</i> and histopathological studies confirmed these results.

This case prompted a thorough review of the existing literature to elucidate possible mechanisms by which immune responses to the COVID-19 vaccine might precipitate thyroid damage. The primary objective is to enhance the clinical understanding and awareness of SAT among healthcare professionals. Subacute thyroiditis is a prevalent form of self-limiting thyroid disorder characterized by fever, neck pain or tenderness, and palpitations subsequent to viral infection. The development of numerous SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic was intended to mitigate the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, there have been documented instances of adverse reactions arising from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such as the infrequent occurrence of subacute thyroiditis. While the majority of medical practitioners can discern classic subacute thyroiditis, not all cases exhibit typical characteristics, and not all systematic treatments yield positive responses. In this study, we present a rare case of subacute thyroiditis linked to the administration of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A previously healthy middle-aged female developed fever and sore throat 72 h post-inoculation with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Initially attributing these symptoms to a common cold, she self-administered ibuprofen, which normalized her body temperature but failed to alleviate persistent sore throat. Suspecting a laryngopharyngeal disorder, she sought treatment from an otolaryngologist. However, the pain persisted, accompanied by intermittent fever over several days. After an endocrinology consultation, despite the absence of typical neck pain, her examination revealed abnormal thyroid function, normal thyroid antibodies, heterogeneous echogenicity on thyroid ultrasonography, and elevated levels of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). These findings led to a consideration of the diagnosis of SAT. Initially, she was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for her fever, which proved effective, but her neck pain remained uncontrolled. This suggested a poor response to NSAIDs. Consequently, steroid therapy was initiated, after which her symptoms of fever and neck pain rapidly resolved.",2024,,"Yang S, Guan T, Yang H, Hu Y, Zhao Y.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2024.1349615,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, there are numerous factors that lead to OS, therefore, identifying the key genes associated with PCOS that contribute to OS is crucial for elucidating the pathogenesis of PCOS and selecting appropriate treatment strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>Four datasets (GSE95728, GSE106724, GSE138572, and GSE145296) were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. GSE95728 and GSE106724 were combined to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PCOS. weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key module genes associated with PCOS. Differentially expressed OS related genes (DE-OSRGs) associated with PCOS were obtained by overlapping DEGs, key module genes, and OSRGs. Subsequently, the optimal machine model was obtained to identify key genes by comparing the performance of the random forest model (RF), support vector machine model (SVM), and generalized linear model (GLM). The molecular networks were constructed to reveal the non-coding regulatory mechanisms of key genes based on GSE138572 and GSE145296. The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) was used to predict the potential therapeutic agents of key genes for PCOS. Finally, the expression of key OSRGs was validated by RT-PCR.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, 8 DE-OSRGs were identified. Based on the residuals and root mean square error of the three models, the best performance of RF was derived and 7 key genes (<i>TNFSF10, CBL, IFNG, CP, CASP8, APOA1</i>, and <i>DDIT3</i>) were identified. The GSEA enrichment analysis revealed that <i>TNFSF10, CP, DDIT3</i>, and <i>INFG</i> are all enriched in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways. The molecular regulatory network uncovered that both <i>TNFSF10</i> and <i>CBL</i> are regulated by non-coding RNAs. Additionally, 70 potential therapeutic drugs for PCOS were predicted, with ibuprofen associated with <i>DDIT3</i> and <i>IFNG</i>.

To study the effect of α-MMC on plant viral defense and how α-MMC increases plant resistance to virus, the <i>M. charantia</i>-<i>cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) interaction system was investigated. The results showed that the α-MMC level was positively correlated with the resistance of <i>M. charantia</i> to CMV. α-MMC treatment could alleviate photosystem damage and enhance the ratio of glutathione/glutathione disulfide in <i>M. charantia</i> under CMV infection. The relationship of α-MMC and defense related phytohormones, and their roles in plant defense were further investigated. α-MMC treatment led to a significant increase of jasmonic acid (JA) and vice versa, while there was no obvious relevance between salicylic acid and α-MMC. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were induced in α-MMC-pretreated plants, in a similar way to the ROS burst in JA-pretreated plants.

The formation of a Candida biofilm can decrease Candida sensitivity to antifungal drugs and cause drug resistance. Although many effective antifungal drugs are available, their applications are limited due to their high toxicity and cost. Seeking new antifungal agents that are effective against biofilm-associated infection is an urgent need. Many research efforts are underway, and some progress has been made in this field. It has been shown that the arachidonic acid cascade plays an important role in fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity. Notably, prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) can promote the formation of a Candida biofilm. Recently, the inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub> has received much attention. Studies have shown that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin, combined with fluconazole can significantly reduce Candida adhesion and biofilm development and increase fluconazole susceptibility; the MIC of fluconazole can be decrease from 64 to 2 μg/ml when used in combination with ibuprofen. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> studies have also confirmed the antifungal activities of these inhibitors.

But, it is also produced from plants and microorganisms. The natural occurrence of styrene led to several microbiological strategies to form and also to degrade styrene. One pathway designated as side-chain oxygenation has been reported as a specific route for the styrene degradation among microorganisms. It comprises the following enzymes: styrene monooxygenase (SMO; NADH-consuming and FAD-dependent, two-component system), styrene oxide isomerase (SOI; cofactor independent, membrane-bound protein) and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PAD; NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming) and allows an intrinsic cofactor regeneration. This specific way harbors a high potential for biotechnological use. Based on the enzymatic steps involved in this degradation route, important reactions can be realized from a large number of substrates which gain access to different interesting precursors for further applications. Furthermore, stereochemical transformations are possible, offering chiral products at high enantiomeric excess. This review provides an actual view on the microbiological styrene degradation followed by a detailed discussion on the enzymes of the side-chain oxygenation. Furthermore, the potential of the single enzyme reactions as well as the respective multi-step syntheses using the complete enzyme cascade are discussed in order to gain styrene oxides, phenylacetaldehydes, or phenylacetic acids (e.g., ibuprofen). Altered routes combining these putative biocatalysts with other enzymes are additionally described. Thus, the substrates spectrum can be enhanced and additional products as phenylethanols or phenylethylamines are reachable.

We found that most studies investigating NSAIDs' activity against biofilms were <i>in vitro</i>, and frequently tested non-clinical bacterial isolates, which may not adequately represent the bacterial populations that cause clinically-relevant biofilm-related infections. Furthermore, studies concerning NSAIDs and antibiotic resistance are scarce, with divergent outcomes. Although the potential to use NSAIDs to control biofilm-related infections seems to be an exciting avenue, there is a paucity of studies that tested these drugs using appropriate <i>in vivo</i> models of biofilm infections or in controlled human clinical trials to support their repurposing as anti-biofilm agents.",2021,,"Paes Leme RC, da Silva RB.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.707629/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To address this, understanding the effects of NSAIDs on bacteria is crucial for bioremediation efforts in pharmaceutical-contaminated environments. The primary challenge in breaking down persistent compounds lies not in the biochemical pathways but in capacity of bacteria to surmount stressors.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we examined the biodegradative activity, morphological and physiological changes, and ultrastructural adaptations of <i>Rhodococcus cerastii</i> strain IEGM 1243 when exposed to ibuprofen, diclofenac, and their mixture.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Our findings revealed that <i>R. cerastii</i> IEGM 1243 exhibited moderate biodegradative activity towards the tested NSAIDs. Cellular respiration assay showed higher metabolic activity in the presence of NSAIDs, indicating their influence on bacterial metabolism. Furthermore, catalase activity in <i>R. cerastii</i> IEGM 1243 exposed to NSAIDs showed an initial decrease followed by fluctuations, with the most significant changes observed in the presence of DCF and the NSAID mixture, likely influenced by bacterial growth phases, active NSAID degradation, and the formation of multicellular aggregates, suggesting potential intercellular synergy and task distribution within the bacterial community. Morphometric analysis demonstrated alterations in size, shape, and surface roughness of cells exposed to NSAIDs, with a decrease in surface area and volume, and an increase in surface area-to-volume ratio (SA/V). Moreover, for the first time, transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of lipid inclusions, polyphosphates, and intracellular membrane-like structures in the ibuprofen-treated cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results provide valuable insights into the adaptive responses of <i>R. cerastii</i> IEGM 1243 to NSAIDs, shedding light on the possible interaction between bacteria and pharmaceutical compounds in the environment.",2023,,"Tyumina E, Bazhutin G, Kostrikina N, Sorokin V, Mulyukin A, Ivshina I.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1275553,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Inflammation is associated with increasing cancer incidence. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that NSAID treatment could cause an anti-tumor effect in cancers. In the present study, blood was taken from healthy individuals (<i>n</i> = 17) and patients with respiratory diseases or lung cancer (<i>n</i> = 36). White blood cells (WBC) were treated with either a micro-suspension, i.e., bulk (B) or nano-suspension (N) of aspirin (ASP) or ibuprofen (IBU) up to 500 μg/ml in the comet assay and up to 125 μg/ml in the micronucleus assay. In this study results were compared against untreated lymphocytes and their corresponding treated groups. The results showed, that NSAIDs in their nano form significantly reduced the DNA damage in WBCs from lung cancer patients in bulk and nano compared to untreated lymphocytes. Also, there was a decrease in the level of DNA damage in the comet assay after treating WBCs from healthy individuals, asthma and COPD groups with aspirin N (ASP N) but not with IBU N. In addition, the number of micronuclei decreased after treatment with NSAIDs in their nano form (ASP N and IBU N) in the healthy as well as in the lung cancer group. However, this was not the case for micronucleus frequency in asthma and COPD patients.

In rats, permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) causes a progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, learning deficits and memory loss as it occurs in AD. Kyotorphin (KTP) is an endogenous antinociceptive dipeptide whose role as neuromodulator/neuroprotector has been suggested. Recently, we designed two analgesic KTP-derivatives, KTP-amide (KTP-NH2) and KTP-NH2 linked to ibuprofen (IbKTP-NH2) to improve KTP brain targeting. This study investigated the effects of KTP-derivatives on cognitive/behavioral functions (motor/spatial memory/nociception) and hippocampal pathology of female rats in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (2VO-rat model). 2VO-animals were treated with KTP-NH2 or IbKTP-NH2 for 7 days at weeks 2 and 5 post-surgery. After behavioral testing (week 6), coronal sections of hippocampus were H&E-stained or immunolabeled for the cellular markers GFAP (astrocytes) and NFL (neurons).

Due to the lack of a screening platform, which could allow in-vitro testing of several variables simultaneously, up to now no comprehensive study has addressed and clarified how different lesion microenvironment properties affect astrogliosis. Using astrocytes cultured in alginate gels and meningeal fibroblast conditioned medium, we have built a simple and reproducible 3D culture system of astrogliosis mimicking many features of the glial scar. Cells in this 3D culture model behave similarly to scar astrocytes, showing changes in gene expression (e.g., GFAP) and increased extra-cellular matrix production (chondroitin 4 sulfate and collagen), inhibiting neuronal outgrowth. This behavior being influenced by the hydrogel network properties. Astrocytic reactivity was found to be dependent on RhoA activity, and targeting RhoA using shRNA-mediated lentivirus reduced astrocytic reactivity. Further, we have shown that chemical inhibition of RhoA with ibuprofen or indirectly targeting RhoA by the induction of extracellular matrix composition modification with chondroitinase ABC, can diminish astrogliosis. Besides presenting the extracellular matrix as a key modulator of astrogliosis, this simple, controlled and reproducible 3D culture system constitutes a good scar-like system and offers great potential in future neurodegenerative mechanism studies, as well as in drug screenings envisaging the development of new therapeutic approaches to minimize the effects of the glial scar in the context of central nervous system disease.",2015,,"Rocha DN, Ferraz-Nogueira JP, Barrias CC, Relvas JB, Pêgo AP.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2015.00377/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study utilized a pathogen-free laparotomy model to investigate these changes during the second trimester, as well as their response to anti-inflammatory therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>C57BL/6 pregnant mice at the 14.5-day embryo stage (E 14.5) were either exposed to sevoflurane anesthesia alone or underwent laparotomy procedure. The neuroinflammatory response was evaluated at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postnatal (P7, P14, P21, P28). Tau phosphorylation and cognitive ability were assessed at P28 and P30, respectively. The impact of perioperative administration of ibuprofen (60 mg/kg) on these aforementioned changes was subsequently evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>In the laparotomy group, levels of inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-8, IL-17A, TGF-β, M-CSF, CCL2) in the brains of offspring mice, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, remained consistently elevated from P7 to P28. At P14, while the majority of inflammatory cytokine has no statistical difference, there was still a significant reactivation of inflammatory cytokines observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus at P28. Furthermore, abnormal phosphorylation of tau and deficits in learning and memory were observed at P28 and P30. Administration of perioperative ibuprofen led to improvements in cognitive performance, reduction of systemic inflammation, and inhibiting abnormal phosphorylation of tau in the frontal cortex and hippocampus.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings indicate that cognitive dysfunction is correlated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and tau phosphorylation. Cognitive impairment and tau phosphorylation after laparotomy can persist at least until P28. Anti-inflammatory medications have been shown to enhance cognitive function by rapidly reducing inflammation in the brain, while also impacting neurological changes.

Review of the Literature.,"Headache is the third cause of visits to pediatric emergency departments (ED). According to a systematic review, headaches in children evaluated in the ED are primarily due to benign conditions that tend to be self-limiting or resolve with appropriate pharmacological treatment. The more frequent causes of non-traumatic headache in the ED include primitive headaches (21.8-66.3%) and benign secondary headaches (35.4-63.2%), whereas potentially life-threatening (LT) secondary headaches are less frequent (2-15.3%). Worrying conditions include brain tumors, central nervous system infections, dysfunction of ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and intracranial hemorrhage. In the emergency setting, the main goal is to intercept potentially LT conditions that require immediate medical attention. The initial assessment begins with an in-depth, appropriate history followed by a complete, oriented physical and neurological examination. The literature describes the following red flags requiring further investigation (for example neuroimaging) for recognition of LT conditions: abnormal neurological examination; atypical presentation of headaches: subjective vertigo, intractable vomiting or headaches that wake the child from sleep; recent and progressive severe headache (<6 months); age of the child <6 years; no family history for migraine or primary headache; occipital headache; change of headache; new headache in an immunocompromised child; first or worst headache; symptoms and signs of systemic disease; headaches associated with changes in mental status or focal neurological disorders. In evaluating a child or adolescent who is being treated for headache, physicians should consider using appropriate diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests are varied, and include routine laboratory analysis, cerebral spinal fluid examination, electroencephalography, and computerized tomography or magnetic resonance neuroimaging. The management of headache in the ED depends on the patient's general conditions and the presumable cause of the headache.

Recent advances in understanding the underlying pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia support the involvement of multiple biochemical pathways in the development of the ischemic damage. Fenamates are classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but they are also highly subunit-selective modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, activators of I<sub>KS</sub> potassium channels and antagonists of non-selective cation channels and the NLRP3 inflammosome. In the present study we investigated the effect of mefenamic acid (MFA) in a rodent model of ischemic stroke and then addressed the underlying pharmacological mechanisms <i>in vitro</i> for its actions <i>in vivo</i>. The efficacy of MFA in reducing ischemic damage was evaluated in adult male Wistar rats subjected to a 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of MFA (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) for 24 h, significantly reduced the infarct volume and the total ischemic brain damage. <i>In vitro</i>, the fenamates, MFA, meclofenamic acid, niflumic acid, and flufenamic acid each reduced glutamate-evoked excitotoxicity in cultured embryonic rat hippocampal neurons supporting the idea that this is a drug class action. In contrast the non-fenamate NSAIDs, ibuprofen and indomethacin did not reduce excitotoxicity <i>in vitro</i> indicating that neuroprotection by MFA was not dependent upon anti-inflammatory actions. Co-application of MFA (100 μM) with either of the GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonists picrotoxin (100 μM) or bicuculline (10 μM) or the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (30 mM) did not prevent neuroprotection with MFA, suggesting that the actions of MFA also do not depend on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulation or potassium channel activation.

Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) is generally referred to as an unexplained prolonged fever. However, a standardized FUO definition and management is missing.<h4>Objective</h4>To collect updated data on the approach to fever and FUO among Italian pediatricians.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional anonymous survey was conducted among a large sample of primary care and hospital pediatricians. The panel group formulated and proposed a practical FUO definition, using a modified Delphi approach. A 75% consensus was required to reach an agreement.<h4>Results</h4>Among 620 respondents, paracetamol was the first-choice antipyretic for 97.7% of participants, followed by ibuprofen; 38.4% prescribed antipyretics based on a specific body temperature rather than on child's discomfort, while physical methods were almost completely abandoned. Alternate treatment was recommended by 19.8% (123/620) of participants, 16.9% (105/620) would prescribe antipyretics to prevent adverse events following immunization. Regarding FUO diagnosis, 58.3% (362/620) considered as cut-off a body temperature above 38°C; the duration required was one week according to 36.45% (226/620) of participants, two weeks according to 35.32% (219/620). The FUO definition proposed by the expert panel reached 81% of consent. Large agreement was observed on first-level laboratory and instrumental investigations in the diagnostic evaluation of FUO, whereas more discrepancies arose on second and third-level investigations. Compared to what participants reported for the treatment of non-prolonged fever, a significant decrease in the prescription of paracetamol as first-choice drug in children with FUO was observed (80.5%; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Interestingly, 39% of participants would empirically recommend antibiotics, 13.7% steroids, and 4.5% Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for persistent FUO.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Non-recommended behaviors in fever management persist among pediatricians, including alternating use of paracetamol and ibuprofen, and their prophylactic use for vaccinations. Our data confirm the variability in the definition, work-up, and management of FUO.

Consequently, a specialized team was established and a model focused on early intervention, namely the Delivery Room Intensive Care Unit (DICU) emphasizing ""care, support, and treatment"" was introduced and its impact on the morbidity and mortality outcomes of newborns was assessed. Additionally, we aimed to develop a nomogram model for predicting the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in preterm infants.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study involving 2,788 infants was conducted to compare the characteristics and outcomes of infants admitted following the transition from the previous ""neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)-centered"" approach to the current early ""care, support, and treatment"" model. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded from birth until their discharge. The primary outcome was IVH, with additional evaluation of mortality and morbidities related to the neurological, respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems.<h4>Results</h4>The DICU approach significantly declined the incidence of IVH [OR: 0.16, 95% CrI (0.11,0.23)], hypothermia [OR: 0.33, 95% CrI (0.21,0.50)], apnea [OR: 0.60, 95% CrI (0.47,0.75)], perinatal respiratory diseases [OR: 0.63, 95% CrI (0.52,0.75)] and metabolic acidosis [OR: 0.24, 95% CrI (0.16,0.34)].

Despite all that, KTP limited pharmacological value prompted researchers to develop derivatives more lipophilic and therefore more prone to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and also more resistant to enzymatic degradation. Conjugation of KTP with functional molecules, such as ibuprofen, generated a new class of compounds with additional biological properties. Moreover, the safety profile of these derivatives compared to opioids and their efficacy as neuroprotective agents greatly increases their pharmacological value.",2016,,"Perazzo J, Castanho MA, Sá Santos S.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2016.00530,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, the effects of PA in modulating immune responses in the central nervous system leading to protection against functional changes remain unexplored. Therefore, we sought to examine the protective effects of 80% v/v ethanol extract of PA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced non-spatial memory impairment and neuroinflammation. <b>Methods:</b> Selected major phytoconstituents of PA extract were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Subchronic neurotoxicity was performed in male Wistar rats given daily oral administration of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of the PA extract. Their neurobehavioral activities (functional observation battery and locomotor activity) were scored, and the extracted brains were examined for neuropathological changes. Rats were treated orally with vehicle (5% Tween 20), PA extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), or ibuprofen (IBF; 40 mg/kg) for 14 and 28 days before being subjected to novel object discrimination test. All groups were challenged with LPS (1 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally a day prior to the behavioral tests except for the negative control group. At the end of the behavioral tests, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), CD11b/c integrin expression, and synaptophysin immunoreactivity were determined in the brain tissues. <b>Results:</b> Gallic acid, ellagic acid, corilagin, geraniin, niranthin, phyllanthin, hypophyllanthin, phyltetralin, and isonirtetralin were identified in the PA extract. Subchronic administration of PA extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) showed no abnormalities in neurobehavior and brain histology. PA extract administered at 200 and 400 mg/kg for 14 and 28 days effectively protected the rodents from LPS-induced memory impairment. Similar doses significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) decreased the release of proteins like TNF-α, IL-1β, and iNOS in the brain tissue. NO levels, CD11b/c integrin expression, and synaptophysin immunoreactivity were also reduced as compared with those in the LPS-challenged group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Pre-treatment with PA extract for 14 and 28 days was comparable with pre-treatment with IBF in prevention of memory impairment and alleviation of neuroinflammatory responses induced by LPS.

There is currently no effective drug to cure COVID-19. Based on analyses of available data, we deduced that excessive prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) produced by cyclooxygenase-2 was a key pathological event of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective clinical study was conducted in one hospital for COVID-19 treatment with Celebrex to suppress the excessive PGE<sub>2</sub> production. A total of 44 COVID-19 cases were enrolled, 37 cases in the experimental group received Celebrex as adjuvant (full dose: 0.2 g, <i>bid</i>; half dose: 0.2 g, <i>qd</i>) for 7-14 days, and the dosage and duration was adjusted for individuals, while seven cases in the control group received the standard therapy. The clinical outcomes were evaluated by measuring the urine PGE<sub>2</sub> levels, lab tests, CT scans, vital signs, and other clinical data. The urine PGE<sub>2</sub> levels were measured by mass spectrometry. The study was registered and can be accessed at http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=50474. <b>Results:</b> The concentrations of PGE<sub>2</sub> in urine samples of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those of PGE<sub>2</sub> in urine samples of healthy individuals (mean value: 170 ng/ml vs 18.8 ng/ml, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and positively correlated with the progression of COVID-19. Among those 37 experimental cases, there were 10 cases with age over 60 years (27%, 10/37) and 13 cases (35%, 13/37) with preexisting conditions including cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Twenty-five cases had full dose, 11 cases with half dose of Celebrex, and one case with ibuprofen. The remission rates in midterm were 100%, 82%, and 57% of the full dose, half dose, and control group, respectively, and the discharged rate was 100% at the endpoint with Celebrex treatment. Celebrex significantly reduced the PGE<sub>2</sub> levels and promoted recovery of ordinary and severe COVID-19. Furthermore, more complications, severity, and death rate were widely observed and reported in the COVID-19 group of elders and with comorbidities; however, this phenomenon did not appear in this particular Celebrex adjunctive treatment study. <b>Conclusion:</b> This clinical study indicates that Celebrex adjuvant treatment promotes the recovery of all types of COVID-19 and further reduces the mortality rate of elderly and those with comorbidities.",2020,,"Hong W, Chen Y, You K, Tan S, Wu F, Tao J, Chen X, Zhang J, Xiong Y, Yuan F, Yang Z, Chen T, Chen X, Peng P, Tai Q, Wang J, Zhang F, Li YX.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.561674,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is expected that many patients will add other symptomatic/adjuvant treatments, such as herbal medicines.<h4>Aims</h4>To provide a benefits/risks assessment of selected herbal medicines traditionally indicated for ""respiratory diseases"" within the current frame of the COVID-19 pandemic as an adjuvant treatment.<h4>Method</h4>The plant selection was primarily based on species listed by the WHO and EMA, but some other herbal remedies were considered due to their widespread use in respiratory conditions. Preclinical and clinical data on their efficacy and safety were collected from authoritative sources. The target population were adults with early and mild flu symptoms without underlying conditions. These were evaluated according to a modified PrOACT-URL method with paracetamol, ibuprofen, and codeine as reference drugs. The benefits/risks balance of the treatments was classified as <i>positive</i>, <i>promising</i>, <i>negative</i>, and <i>unknown</i>.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 39 herbal medicines were identified as very likely to appeal to the COVID-19 patient. According to our method, the benefits/risks assessment of the herbal medicines was found to be positive in 5 cases (<i>Althaea officinalis, Commiphora molmol, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hedera helix</i>, and <i>Sambucus nigra</i>), promising in 12 cases (<i>Allium sativum</i>, <i>Andrographis paniculata</i>, <i>Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus</i> essential oil<i>, Justicia pectoralis, Magnolia officinalis</i>, <i>Mikania glomerata</i>, <i>Pelargonium sidoides</i>, <i>Pimpinella anisum</i>, <i>Salix</i> sp, <i>Zingiber officinale</i>), and unknown for the rest. On the same grounds, only ibuprofen resulted promising, but we could not find compelling evidence to endorse the use of paracetamol and/or codeine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our work suggests that several herbal medicines have safety margins superior to those of reference drugs and enough levels of evidence to start a clinical discussion about their potential use as adjuvants in the treatment of early/mild common flu in otherwise healthy adults within the context of COVID-19. While these herbal medicines will not cure or prevent the flu, they may both improve general patient well-being and offer them an opportunity to personalize the therapeutic approaches.",2020,,"Silveira D, Prieto-Garcia JM, Boylan F, Estrada O, Fonseca-Bazzo YM, Jamal CM, Magalhães PO, Pereira EO, Tomczyk M, Heinrich M.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.581840,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Current evidence point to COX-1 inhibition as one of the main factors in its etiopathogenesis. Evidence also suggests that the risk is dose-dependent. Therefore it could be speculated that individuals with impaired NSAID biodisposition might be at increased risk of developing cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. We analyzed common functional gene variants for <i>CYP2C8, CYP2C9,</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> in a large cohort composed of 499 patients with cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and 624 healthy individuals who tolerated NSAIDs. Patients were analyzed as a whole group and subdivided in three groups according to the main enzymes involved in the metabolism of the culprit drugs as follows: CYP2C9, aceclofenac, indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, meloxicam, lornoxicam, and celecoxib; CYP2C8 plus CYP2C9, ibuprofen and diclofenac; CYP2C19 plus CYP2C9, metamizole. Genotype calls ranged from 94 to 99%. No statistically significant differences between patients and controls were identified in this study, either for allele frequencies, diplotypes, or inferred phenotypes. After patient stratification according to the enzymes involved in the metabolism of the culprit drugs, or according to the clinical presentation of the hypersensitivity reaction, we identified weak significant associations of a lower frequency (as compared to that of control subjects) of <i>CYP2C8*3/*3</i> genotypes in patients receiving NSAIDs that are predominantly CYP2C9 substrates, and in patients with NSAIDs-exacerbated cutaneous disease. However, these associations lost significance after False Discovery Rate correction for multiple comparisons. Taking together these findings and the statistical power of this cohort, we conclude that there is no evidence of a major implication of the major functional <i>CYP2C</i> polymorphisms analyzed in this study and the risk of developing cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. This argues against the hypothesis of a dose-dependent COX-1 inhibition as the main underlying mechanism for this adverse drug event and suggests that pre-emptive genotyping aiming at drug selection should have a low practical utility for cross-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs.",2021,,"Macías Y, García-Menaya JM, Martí M, Cordobés C, Jurado-Escobar R, Cornejo-García JA, Torres MJ, Blanca-López N, Canto G, Blanca M, Laguna JJ, Bartra J, Rosado A, Fernández J, García-Martín E, Agúndez JAG.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.648262,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Additionally, the safety profiles of these drug treatments need to be documented and shared with the public. Some studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment. On the contrary, others have also reported that NSAIDs and corticosteroids may worsen symptoms associated with COVID-19. While some researchers have suggested that corticosteroids may be helpful if used in the early stages of COVID-19, there are still some conflicting findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in certain viral infections. Our review suggests that methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and ibuprofen have therapeutic potential in reducing mortality due to COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. This review also highlights the fact that the use of NSAIDs is not associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19. In reality, evidence suggests that NSAIDs do not increase the risk of COVID-19 infections.

Hearing loss can be the result of intense or prolonged noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, infections, and trauma, which trigger inflammatory signaling cascades that lead to irreversible damage to cochlear structures. To address this, we developed and characterized a series of covalent conjugates of anti-inflammatory drugs to hyaluronic acid (HA), for potential use as topical ototherapeutics. These conjugates were tested in <i>in vitro</i> assays designed to mirror physiological processes typically observed with acoustic trauma. Intense noise exposure leads to macrophage recruitment to the cochlea and subsequent inflammatory damage to sensory cells. We therefore first tested our conjugates' ability to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. This anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages also translated to increased cochlear cell viability. In our initial screening, one conjugate, ibuprofen-HA, demonstrated significantly higher anti-inflammatory potential than its counterparts. Subsequent cytokine release profiling of ibuprofen-HA further confirmed its ability to reduce a wider range of inflammatory markers, to a greater extent than its equivalent unconjugated drug. The conjugate's potential as a topical therapeutic was then assessed in previously developed tympanic and round window membrane tissue permeation models. As expected, our data indicate that the conjugate has limited tympanic membrane model permeability; however, it readily permeated the round window membrane model and to a greater extent than the unconjugated drug. Interestingly, our data also revealed that ibuprofen-HA was well tolerated in cellular and tissue cytocompatibility assays, whereas the unconjugated drug displayed significant cytotoxicity at equivalent concentrations. Moreover, our data highlighted the importance of chemical conjugation of ibuprofen to HA; the conjugate had improved anti-inflammatory effects, significantly reduced cytotoxicity, and is more suitable for therapeutic formulation. Overall, this work suggests that ibuprofen-HA could be a promising safe and effective topical ototherapeutic for inflammation-mediated cochlear damage.",2024,,"Birru B, Veit JGS, Arrigali EM, Van Tine J, Barrett-Catton E, Tonnerre Z, Diaz P, Serban MA.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1355283/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Current anticonvulsants primarily target ion channels and receptors implicated in seizure activity. Identification of neurotherapeutics that can inhibit epileptiform activity and reduce inflammation in the brain may offer significant benefits in the long-term management of epilepsy. Fenamates are unique because they are both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and highly subunit selective modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. In the current study we have investigated the hypothesis that fenamates have antiseizure properties using mature human stem cell-derived neuro-glia cell cultures, maintained in long-term culture, and previously shown to be sensitive to first, second and third generation antiepileptics. Mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, niflumic acid, and tolfenamic acid (each tested at 10-100 μM) attenuated 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 100 μM) evoked epileptiform activity in a dose-dependent fashion. These actions were as effective diazepam (3-30 μM) and up to 200 times more potent than phenobarbital (300-1,000 μM). The low (micromolar) concentrations of fenamates that inhibited 4-AP evoked epileptiform activity correspond to those reported to potentiate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function. In contrast, the fenamates had no effect on neural spike amplitudes, indicating that their antiseizure actions did not result from inhibition of sodium-channels. The antiseizure actions of fenamates were also not replicated by either of the two non-fenamate NSAIDs, ibuprofen (10-100 μM) or indomethacin (10-100 μM), indicating that inhibition of cyclooxygenases is not the mechanism through which fenamates have anticonvulsant properties. This study therefore shows for the first time, using functionally mature human stem cell-derived neuroglial circuits, that fenamate NSAIDs have powerful antiseizure actions independent of, and in addition to their well-established anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting these drugs may provide a novel insight and new approach to the treatment of epilepsy in the future.",2024,,"Salmanzadeh H, Halliwell RF.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1385523,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is characterized by generalized slowness of movement, resting tremor or stiffness, and bradykinesia. PD patients' brains mostly exhibit an increase in inflammatory mediators and microglial response. Nevertheless, a variety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) offered neuroprotection in animal models and preclinical trials. <b>Aim:</b> The current systematic review and meta-analysis were designed to try to resolve the debate over the association of NSAID use with the development of PD because the results of several studies were somehow contradictory. <b>Methods:</b> An intense search was performed on Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for articles relating the incidence of PD to the use of NSAIDs.

Thus, developing a dual inhibitor that targets both could be more effective as an anticancer agent than single inhibitors. We have previously shown that an analog of the bezafibrate named AA520 is a PPARα antagonist. Herein, we report the identification of AA520 as a potent COX-2 inhibitor using <i>in silico</i> approaches. In addition, we performed a thorough pharmacological characterization of AA520 towards COX-1 and COX-2 in different <i>in vitro</i> models.<h4>Methods</h4>AA520 was characterized for inhibiting platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 activity in human whole blood (HWB) and for effects on lipidomics of eicosanoids using LC-MS/MS. The kinetics of the interaction of AA520 with COX-2 was assessed in the human colon cancer cell line, HCA-7, expressing only COX-2, by testing the COX-2 activity after extensive washing of the cells. The impact of AA520 on cancer cell viability, metabolic activity, and cytotoxicity was tested using the MTT reagent.<h4>Results</h4>In HWB, AA520 inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion LPS-stimulated leukocyte prostaglandin (PG) E<sub>2</sub> generation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05-0.263) μM while platelet COX-1 was not affected up to 300 μM. AA520 did not affect LPS-induced monocyte COX-2 expression, and other eicosanoids generated by enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. AA520 inhibited COX-2-dependent PGE<sub>2</sub> generation in the colon cancer cell line HCA7. Comparison of the inhibition of COX-2 and its reversibility by AA520, indomethacin (a time-dependent inhibitor), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (an irreversible inhibitor), and ibuprofen (a reversible inhibitor) showed that the compound is acting by forming a tightly bound COX-2 interaction. This was confirmed by docking and molecular dynamics studies. Moreover, AA520 (1 μM) significantly reduced MTT in HCA7 cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We have identified a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor with a unique scaffold. This inhibitor retains PPARα antagonism at the same concentration range. It has the potential to be effective in treating certain types of cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where COX-2 and PPARα are overexpressed.",2024,,"Ammazzalorso A, Tacconelli S, Contursi A, Hofling U, Cerchia C, Di Berardino S, De Michele A, Amoroso R, Lavecchia A, Patrignani P.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1488722,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

G-quadruplex (G4) motifs in promoter regions have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. This study explores G4 stabilization in the GLI1 promoter as a novel strategy to suppress gastric cancer progression.<h4>Methods</h4>G4 formation in the GLI1 promoter was validated using circular dichroism. A dual-luciferase assay screened FDA-approved drugs for G4-stabilizing activity, identifying alpha-estradiol and (R)-(-)-ibuprofen as candidates. These compounds were evaluated for anti-tumor effects through in vitro assays (proliferation, migration, invasion) and in vivo xenograft models. Mechanistic insights into GLI1/PRKACB signaling were obtained via chromatin immunoprecipitation and pathway analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Stable G4 structures were confirmed in the GLI1 promoter. Alpha-estradiol and (R)-(-)-ibuprofen suppressed GLI1 transcription and protein levels, significantly inhibiting gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness. In vivo, both compounds reduced tumor growth and metastasis, with (R)-(-)-ibuprofen synergizing with cisplatin to enhance efficacy. Mechanistically, GLI1 directly regulated PRKACB expression, and G4 stabilization downregulated PRKACB, impairing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Targeting GLI1 G4 structures with alpha-estradiol and (R)-(-)-ibuprofen effectively inhibits gastric cancer progression by blocking GLI1/PRKACB signaling.

Pharmacological treatment of combined infectious and inflammatory diseases requires the administration of multiple drugs, including antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. However, this can cause adverse effects, and therefore, dual-action drugs need to be developed. Anti-inflammatory drugs that have already shown antimicrobial properties appear to be promising candidates. NSAIDs, namely aceclofenac, diclofenac, and ibuprofen, were tested in clinical trials with patients diagnosed with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) and cellulitis. The administration of ibuprofen, a drug tested in the highest number of studies, resulted in symptom resolution in patients with UTIs. Additionally, ibuprofen caused a high survival rate in mice infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and demonstrated potent <i>in vitro</i> antibacterial effects against <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> including methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) (MIC 0.625-2.5 mg/L). For most anti-inflammatory drugs, only data showing their <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> antimicrobial effects are available. Among these, auranofin caused a high survival rate in mice infected with <i>Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus,</i> and <i>Clostridioides difficile.</i> It also produced a strong <i>in vitro</i> growth-inhibitory effect against <i>Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, C. difficile, E. faecalis, E. faecium,</i> and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MIC 0.0015-5 mg/L).

Moreover, topical application of celecoxib resulted in a high reduction in MRSA burden in mice. However, it only caused moderate <i>in vitro</i> effects against <i>S. epidermidis</i>, <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>Bacillus subitilis</i> (MIC 16-64 mg/L). These data suggest that certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are promising drug candidates for the development of dual-action drugs for the potential treatment of combined infectious and inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, musculoskeletal infections and UTIs.

Conscious rats were exposed to room air (RA) or IH with or without treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, an antioxidant), Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), ibuprofen (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), or their vehicles. Immediately after exposure (24 h), we found that intravenous capsaicin, phenylbiguanide, or α,β-methylene-ATP evoked augmented LVCF-mediated apneic responses and LVCF afferent responses in rats subjected to IH exposure in comparison with those in RA rats. The potentiating effect of IH on LVCF responses decreased at 6 h after and vanished at 12 h after the termination of IH exposure. The potentiating effect of IH on LVCF-mediated apneic and LVCF afferent responses was significantly attenuated by treatment with NAC, compound C, or ibuprofen, but not by their vehicles. Further biochemical analysis revealed that rats exposed to IH displayed increased lung levels of lipid peroxidation (an index of oxidative stress), AMPK phosphorylation (an index of AMPK activation), and prostaglandin E2 (a cyclooxygenase metabolite), compared with those exposed to RA. IH-induced increase in lipid peroxidation was considerably suppressed by treatment with NAC but not by compound C or ibuprofen. IH-induced increase in AMPK phosphorylation was totally abolished by NAC or compound C but not by ibuprofen. IH-induced increase in prostaglandin E2 was considerably prevented by any of these three inhibitor treatments. The vehicles of these inhibitors exerted no significant effect on the three IH-induced responses. These results suggest that 24-h IH exposure sensitizes LVCFs, leading to an exaggerated reflex and afferent responses to chemical stimulants in rats. Moreover, this IH-induced LVCF sensitization is mediated through a cascade of inflammatory responses in the airways involving increases in ROS, AMPK activation, and cyclooxygenase metabolite release.",2016,,"Yang CH, Shen YJ, Lai CJ, Kou YR.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00263/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

As a secondary aim, we compared the effects of eccentric overload with conventional training. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty participants were randomized to either a group taking high doses (3 × 400 mg/day) of ibuprofen (IBU; 27 ± 5 year; <i>n</i> = 11) or a group ingesting a low dose (1 × 75 mg/day) of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; 26 ± 4 year; <i>n</i> = 9) during 8 weeks of supervised knee extensor resistance training. Each of the subject's legs were randomized to complete the training program using either a flywheel (FW) device emphasizing eccentric overload, or a traditional weight stack machine (WS). Maximal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (CI+II<sub>P</sub>) from permeabilized skeletal muscle bundles was assessed using high-resolution respirometry. Citrate synthase (CS) activity was assessed using spectrophotometric techniques and mitochondrial protein content using western blotting. <b>Results:</b> After training, CI+II<sub>P</sub> decreased (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in both IBU (23%) and ASA (29%) with no difference across medical treatments. Although CI+II<sub>P</sub> decreased in both legs, the decrease was greater (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.015) in WS (33%, <i>p</i> = 0.001) compared with FW (19%, <i>p</i> = 0.078). CS activity increased (<i>p</i> = 0.027) with resistance training, with no interactions with medical treatment or training modality. Protein expression of ULK1 increased with training in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The increase in quadriceps muscle volume was not correlated with changes in CI+II<sub>P</sub> (<i>R</i> = 0.16). <b>Conclusion:</b> These results suggest that 8 weeks of resistance training with co-ingestion of anti-inflammatory drugs reduces mitochondrial function but increases mitochondrial content. The observed changes were not affected by higher doses of NSAIDs consumption, suggesting that the resistance training intervention was the prime mediator of the decreased mitochondrial phosphorylation. Finally, we noted that flywheel resistance training, emphasizing eccentric overload, rescued some of the reduction in mitochondrial function seen with conventional resistance training.",2017,,"Cardinale DA, Lilja M, Mandić M, Gustafsson T, Larsen FJ, Lundberg TR.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.01074,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The primary therapeutic mechanism of these widely used drugs is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX1, 2) enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. At higher doses, NSAIDs are used for prevention of certain types of cancer and as experimental treatments for Alzheimer's disease. In the immune system, various NSAIDs have been reported to influence neutrophil function and lymphocyte proliferation, and affect ion channels and cellular calcium homeostasis. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) cation channels are highly expressed in T lymphocytes and are inhibited by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, acidic pH, and polyamines. Here, we report a novel effect of naproxen, ibuprofen, salicylate, and acetylsalicylate on TRPM7. At concentrations of 3-30mM, they reversibly inhibited TRPM7 channel currents. By measuring intracellular pH with the ratiometric indicator BCECF, we found that at 300μM to 30mM, these NSAIDs reversibly acidified the cytoplasm in a concentration-dependent manner, and propose that TRPM7 channel inhibition is a consequence of cytosolic acidification, rather than direct. NSAID inhibition of TRPM7 channels was slow, voltage-independent, and displayed use-dependence, increasing in potency upon repeated drug applications. The extent of channel inhibition by salicylate strongly depended on cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, as revealed when this phospholipid was depleted with voltage-sensitive lipid phosphatase (VSP). Salicylate inhibited heterologously expressed wildtype TRPM7 channels but not the S1107R variant, which is insensitive to cytosolic pH, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion. NSAID-induced acidification was also observed in Schneider 2 cells from <i>Drosophila</i>, an organism that lacks orthologous COX genes, suggesting that this effect is unrelated to COX enzyme activity. A 24-h exposure to 300μM-10mM naproxen resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in cell viability.

The Lake Massaciuccoli located in Tuscany (Italy) is one of the largest swamps that in ancient times entirely covered the Versilia coastal plain. Despite its peculiar features, especially the eutrophic characteristics, its native microalgal consortia have never been explored up to now. In this work, we isolated and described four autochthonous microalgal strains from different sites in the lake (FB, Idr, CL_Sc, and CL_Ch); the four microalgal strains were identified within the <i>Chlorella sorokiniana</i> clade. We exposed them to ten of the most common or emerging environmental contaminants in order to describe their preliminary response to the tested substances: five metals (As, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn), two herbicides (Metolachlor and Sethoxydim), two antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Benzylpenicillin) and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Ibuprofen). Physiological response of the strains highlighted intraspecific differences; strain CL_Sc was the most tolerant in presence of metals while strain Idr was the most sensitive. All strains were sensitive to sethoxydim and tolerant to metolachlor at all the tested concentrations. Strains FB and Idr were the most sensitive in presence of Ibuprofen while strain CL_Ch was the most sensitive to the highest Benzylpenicillin concentration. Resistance pattern of strain Idr somehow reflects both the phylogenetic and the geographic ""isolation"" from all other three strains. Finally, optical microscope observation confirmed some differences also in the microalgae morphological aspect. Overall, all the strains showed interesting responses in presence of high concentrations of the tested substances, representing putative interesting candidates for water remediation in wastewater treatment plants.",2020,,"Chiellini C, Guglielminetti L, Sarrocco S, Ciurli A.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.607651,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The addition of <i>F. nucleatum</i> lysate resulted in the strongest release of proinflammatory cytokines by PDL fibroblast and MONO-MAC-6 cells, while the modification by the tested anti-rheumatic drugs was only minor. After stimulation of the MONO-MAC-cells with <i>F. nucleatum</i>, prednisolone increased the release of IL-8, whereas methotrexate decreased the level.

APAP and IBU are over-the-counter drugs and are among the most commonly taken drugs in the first trimester of pregnancy, even in combination. Furthermore, these drugs and their metabolites are released in the environment, and can be frequently detected in wastewater, surface water, and importantly in drinking water. Although their environmental concentrations are much lower than the therapeutics doses, this suggests an uncontrolled low-dose exposure of the general population, including pregnant women and young children, two particularly at risk populations. Epidemiological studies show that exposure to these molecules in the first and second trimester of gestation can favor genital malformations in new-born boys. To investigate the cellular, molecular and mechanistic effects of exposure to these molecules, <i>ex vivo</i> studies with human or rodent gonadal explants and <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rodents have been performed in the past years. This review recapitulates recent data obtained in rodent models after <i>in utero</i> or postnatal exposure to these drugs. The first part of this review discusses the mechanisms by which NSAIDs and analgesics may impair gonadal development and maturation, puberty development, sex hormone production, maturation and function of adult organs, and ultimately fertility in the exposed animals and their offspring. Like other endocrine disruptors, NSAIDs and APAP interfere with endocrine gland function and may have inter/transgenerational adverse effects. Particularly, they may target germ cells, resulting in reduced quality of male and female gametes, and decreased fertility of exposed individuals and their descendants. Then, this review discusses the effects of exposure to a single drug (APAP, aspirin, or IBU) or to combinations of drugs during early embryogenesis, and the consequences on postnatal gonadal development and adult reproductive health. Altogether, these data may increase medical and public awareness about these reproductive health concerns, particularly in women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and parents of young children.",2022,,"Boizet-Bonhoure B, Déjardin S, Rossitto M, Poulat F, Philibert P.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2022.835360/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, challenges arise when using ECBP for small dogs and cats because the priming volume required by most machine-based ECBP platforms might be excessive, leading to cardiovascular instability if a blood prime is not used. This report describes the successful use of manual carbon hemoperfusion (MCHP) to reduce plasma meloxicam levels in a cat following an inadvertent overdose and its use in a dog following suspected ibuprofen ingestion. In both animals, MCHP reduced the circuit volume needed for ECBP from 125 mL with a machine-based therapeutic plasma exchange or 104 mL with an in-series carbon hemoperfusion on an intermittent hemodialysis platform to just 40-50 mL. In the cat, MCHP reduced plasma meloxicam levels by 44%, and in both animals, the use of MCHP in these pets was well-tolerated and safe. Due to pre-existing anemia, the cat required a blood transfusion but the dog did not. MCHP is technically simple and can be performed at any hospital with access to carbon filters and blood bank resources. This technique may represent a reasonable alternative to treat NSAID toxicities in animals that are too small for conventional extracorporeal decontamination methods using either machine-based platforms without using a blood prime or in locations where these machines are unavailable.",2024,,"Haire LE, Vitalo AD, Gonçalves RP, Lanaux TM.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2024.1395967,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Despite many years of methodological improvements, the pregnancy rate (PR) in cows has not increased in direct proportion with their development. Among the possibilities to increase the PR is the use of certain steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The antiluteolytic effect of NSAIDs is achieved by blocking cyclooxygenase, which is involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. This article compares the PRs obtained after treatment with the commonly used NSAIDs in cattle, including flunixin meglumine, carprofen, meloxicam, ibuprofen, aspirin, and sildenafil. Studies on the effectiveness of certain steroid drugs on the PR have also been described. The results were not always consistent, and so comparisons between studies were made. In conclusion, flunixin meglumine seems to be an option, and can be recommended for improving ET results, especially in situations of high exposure or susceptibility to stress.

Among these factors, polymorphisms in genes related to autophagy and the consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been consistently associated with IBD. We show that NSAIDs induce mitochondrial stress and mitophagy in intestinal epithelial cells. In an altered mitophagy context simulating that observed in IBD patients, NSAID-induced mitochondrial stress leads to the release of mitochondrial components, which act as Danger Associated Molecular Patterns with pro-inflammatory potential. Furthermore, colonic organoids from Crohn's disease patients and healthy donors show activation of the mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) upon treatment with ibuprofen. Finally, colon biopsies from Crohn's disease patients in remission or with low-to-moderate activity also show expression of genes involved in UPR<sup>mt</sup>, while patients with severe activity show no increase compared to healthy donors.

We investigated the action of citral on body temperature (Tb) and inflammatory signaling in eutrophic and obese mice during Systemic Inflammation (SI) induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Thus, we assessed the effect of citral (25, 100, and 300 mg/kg) and ibuprofen in LPS-induced SI in Swiss male mice fed a standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Following SI induction, we measured Tb and collected the serum, hypothalamus, and gastric mucosa for biochemical measurements. Acute treatment with citral decreased the Tb of both SD and HFD-fed animals. Citral (300 mg/kg) treatment caused a significantly lower Tb variation in HFD-fed animals than in those fed the SD. Citral reduced peripheral levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in SD and HFD mice and decreased serum leptin concentration in HFD mice 90 min after the LPS challenge. Furthermore, citral also reduced interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the hypothalamus of obese mice.

Microglial activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. This study aimed to characterize the role of microglial activation in aging-related nigral DA neuron loss and motor deficits in mice. We showed that, compared to 3-month-old mice, the number of DA neurons in the SN and the expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum decreased during the period of 9 to 12 months of age. Motor deficits and microglial activation in the SN were also evident during these months. The number of DA neurons was negatively correlated with the degrees of microglial activation. The inhibition of age-related microglial activation by ibuprofen during these 3 months decreased DA neuron loss in the SN. Eliminating the microglia prevented systemic inflammation-induced DA neuron death. Forcing mice to run during these 3 months inhibited microglial activation and DA neuron loss. Blocking the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling eliminated the exercise-induced protective effects. In conclusion, nigral DA neurons were susceptible to local microglial activation. Running exercise upregulated BDNF-TrkB signaling and inhibited microglial activation during aging. Long-term exercise can be considered as a non-pharmacological strategy to ameliorate microglial activation and related neurodegeneration.",2022,,"Wang TF, Wu SY, Pan BS, Tsai SF, Kuo YM.",https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030481,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

At present, no drug treatments are routinely given in the clinic following a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) to improve regeneration and remyelination of damaged nerves. Appropriately targeted therapeutic agents have the potential to be used at different stages following nerve damage, e.g., to maintain Schwann cell viability, induce and sustain a repair phenotype to support axonal growth, or promote remyelination. The development of therapies to promote nerve regeneration is currently of high interest to researchers, however, translation to the clinic of drug therapies for PNI is still lacking. Studying the effect of PPARγ agonists for treatment of peripheral nerve injures has demonstrated significant benefits. Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has reproducibly demonstrated benefits in vitro and in vivo, suggested to be due to its agonist action on PPARγ. Other NSAIDs have demonstrated differing levels of PPARγ activation based upon their affinity. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether affinity for PPARγ of selected drugs corresponded to an increase in regeneration. A 3D co-culture in vitro model identified some correlation between these two properties. However, when the drug treatments were screened in vivo, in a crush injury model in a rat sciatic nerve, the same correlation was not apparent. Further differences were observed between capacity to increase axon number and improvement in functional recovery. Despite there not being a clear correlation between affinity and size of effect on regeneration, all selected PPARγ agonists improved regeneration, providing a panel of compounds that could be explored for use in the treatment of PNI.",2022,,"Rayner MLD, Kellaway SC, Kingston I, Guillemot-Legris O, Gregory H, Healy J, Phillips JB.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/12/1/42/pdf?version=1671703536,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Perturbations of the intestinal epithelium or supporting factors can lead to the development of intestinal hyperpermeability, termed ""leaky gut"". A leaky gut is characterized by loss of epithelial integrity and reduced function of the gut barrier, and is associated with prolonged use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatories. The harmful effect of NSAIDs on intestinal and gastric epithelial integrity is considered an adverse effect that is common to all drugs belonging to this class, and it is strictly dependent on NSAID properties to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase enzymes. However, different factors may affect the specific tolerability profile of different members of the same class. The present study aims to compare the effects of distinct classes of NSAIDs, such as ketoprofen (K), Ibuprofen (IBU), and their corresponding lysine (Lys) and, only for ibuprofen, arginine (Arg) salts, using an in vitro model of leaky gut. The results obtained showed inflammatory-induced oxidative stress responses, and related overloads of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) accompanied by protein oxidation and morphological changes to the intestinal barrier, many of these effects being counteracted by ketoprofen and ketoprofen lysin salt.

FDE typically presents as localized spots or plaques without systemic symptoms; however, it can manifest in other forms, such as blisters and papules. In FDE, effector memory CD8-positive T cells that remain dormant in the basal layer after a previous inflammation are reactivated upon re-exposure to the causative drug, leading to the development of erythema at the same sites. <b>Case Presentation:</b> Herein, we report the case of a 23-year-old man who developed ibuprofen-induced multiple FDE. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting a rash immediately following ibuprofen administration, and histopathological findings were consistent with FDE. Ibuprofen is widely available as an over-the-counter medication, and patients may not always report its use-making the diagnosis of ibuprofen-induced FDE particularly challenging. Approximately 24 h following drug-induced CD8-positive T cell activation, regulatory T cells normally infiltrate the epidermis to suppress inflammation and promote resolution. However, in multiple FDE, CD8-positive T cell activity may outweigh that of regulatory T cells, causing uncontrolled inflammation and leading to the spread of poorly-demarcated lesions that can progress to severe drug reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

The approach presented here is centered around the development of a prototypic synthetic glycerogel scaffold for bone regeneration, which simultaneously features therapeutic activity. The main novelty of this work lies in the combination of an open meso and macroporous nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC)-based glycerogel with a fully biocompatible microporous bioMOF system (CaSyr-1) composed of calcium ions and syringic acid. The bioMOF framework is further impregnated with a third bioactive component, i.e., ibuprofen (ibu), to generate a multifold bioactive system. The integrated CaSyr-1(ibu) serves as a reservoir for bioactive compounds delivery, while the NCC scaffold is the proposed matrix for cell ingrowth, proliferation and differentiation. The measured drug delivery profiles, studied in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 310 K, indicate that the bioactive components are released concurrently with bioMOF dissolution after ca. 30 min following a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Furthermore, according to the semi-empirical Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model, this release is governed by a case-II mechanism, suggesting that the molecular transport is influenced by the relaxation of the NCC matrix. Preliminary in vitro results denote that the initial high concentration of glycerol in the NCC scaffold can be toxic in direct contact with human osteoblasts (HObs).

Among them, cellulose is a great option for this challenging application due to its increased water retention capacity, mechanical strength, versatility and unlimited availability. Since algae are an unexploited source of cellulose, the novelty of this study is the decellularization of two different species, freshly collected from the Black Sea coast, using two different chemical surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulphate and Triton X-100), and characterisation of the resulted complex biopolymeric 3D matrices. The algae nature and decellularization agent significantly influenced the matrices porosity, while the values obtained for the hydration degree included them in hydrogel class. Moreover, their capacity to retain and then controllably release an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, led us to recommend the obtained structures as drug delivery systems. The decellularized macroalgae hydrogels are bioadhesive and cytocompatible in direct contact with human keratinocytes and represent a great support for cells. Finally, it was noticed that human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) adhered and populated the structures during a monitoring period of 14 days.",2024,,"Luca A, Cojocaru FD, Pascal MS, Vlad T, Nacu I, Peptu CA, Butnaru M, Verestiuc L.",https://doi.org/10.3390/gels10110704,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The purpose of this study was to compare the release and permeation ability of two commonly used permeation enhancers-diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGME) and oleyl alcohol-by the changes in oil composition, the addition of a gelling agent, and water content using ibuprofen as a model drug. Four microemulsions were formulated, selection was based on ternary phase diagrams, and physicochemical properties were evaluated. The release and permeation of the microemulsion formulations were performed in vitro by Franz cell studies on a regenerated cellulose membrane and a Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane, respectively, and the amount of ibuprofen permeated and released was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All four microemulsions were compatible with the skin pH, and the average pH ranged from 4.9 to 5.6. The average droplet size of the microemulsions ranged from 119.8 to 153.3 nm. Drug release was significantly the highest from the gel-based microemulsions (59% and 64%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). However, there was a fourfold difference in drug permeation from these gels-a significantly higher permeation from the microemulsion-gel containing oleic acid and oleyl alcohol compared to the DGME formulation. These results indicated that the microemulsion-gel with oleyl alcohol as the permeation enhancer could be a preferable formulation approach for the topical administration of ibuprofen. These results highlight the need for optimization of the microemulsion formulation to confirm the permeation-enhancing effects of chosen permeation enhancers despite being a well-known permeation enhancer.",2025,,"Pandey S, Baki G.",https://doi.org/10.3390/gels11010041,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Gel-like dispersions were created by blending either gel or powder NCC (gNCC or pNCC) with natural polymers (alginate, pectin, or chitosan) in water, with glycerol serving as a plasticiser. Ibuprofen (IBU) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was dissolved in a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) to improve its solubility prior to its addition to gel-like dispersions. Dispersions were dried, and resulting films were cut to 3 cm × 1.5 cm size, appropriate for buccal delivery. Rheological measurements revealed that shorter, thinner, and less crystalline nanocellulose fibres are more favourable for stronger gel properties. While overall, weaker gel structure prior to film casting also resulted in shorter disintegration time, this was not the case for NCC-chitosan films; here, the low solubility of chitosan in neutral media proved to be the main obstacle. Nevertheless, the prolonged disintegration of NCC-chitosan films did not impact the dissolution of IBU, as these films exhibited the fastest dissolution rate, followed by NCC-pectin and NCC-alginate. Furthermore, NCC properties significantly influenced the dissolution behaviour of the chitosan formulations, with gNCC favouring faster IBU release due to weaker gel formation prior to film casting.",2025,,"Bolko Seljak K, Grilc B, Gašperlin M, Gosenca Matjaž M.",https://doi.org/10.3390/gels11030163,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To address these limitations, we developed a novel hybrid eutectogel composed of xanthan gum (XTG), hyaluronic acid (HA), and a Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent (NADES) system (choline chloride, sorbitol, and glycerol in 2:1:1 mole ratio), incorporating 2.5% ibuprofen (IBU) as a model drug. The formulation was optimized using a face-centered central composite design to enhance the rheological, textural, and drug release properties. The optimized eutectogels exhibited shear-thinning behavior (flow behavior index, <i>n</i> = 0.26 ± 0.01), high mucoadhesion (adhesiveness: 2.297 ± 0.142 N·s), and sustained drug release over 24 h, governed by Higuchi kinetics (release rate: 237.34 ± 13.61 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>/min<sup>1/2</sup>). The ex vivo residence time increased substantially with NADES incorporation, reaching up to 176.7 ± 23.1 min.

The structural characterization of these systems is crucial for the development of new drug delivery systems and for the optimization of their properties. In this study, we utilized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate the structures of poloxamer-based drug delivery systems. The samples were measured using the SANS technique on the VSANS-V16 instrument at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), Germany. The samples contained 20% poloxamer (P407) and 0.2% of a drug (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac) in deuterated water (D<sub>2</sub>O) for SANS. The samples varied in terms of temperature analysis (25 °C, common storage temperature; 37 °C, human body temperature; 40 °C, fever temperature). The data analysis involved modeling the data using a Python-based routine. The model used consisted of an isotropic solution of polydisperse spherical micelles. The intensity as a function of the scattering vector was modeled as the product of the form factor and the interparticle structure factor, with the latter described within the local monodisperse approximation regime. Additionally, a scattering contribution was observed, which was associated with the presence of crystalline superstructures formed by micelles that organized into a cubic structure. The data analysis provided important information about the system, such as the average radius, the size distribution, and the thickness of the layer surrounding the micellar core.

The in vitro release of IBU significantly differed between (i) neutral (hydroxy/alkylcelluloses), (ii) anionic (carboxyalkylcellulose and its sodium salt, tragacanth, carrageenan, xanthan gum), and (iii) cationic (chitosans) hydrogels due to different contribution of provided interactions and viscosity within the hydrogel groups. The drug release kinetics of each hydrogel system was evaluated for five kinetic models. Several combinations of cationic hydrogels with neutral or anionic ones were performed to illustrate possibilities of providing modified IBU release profiles.

Due to a short half-life and rapid elimination, multiple doses of ibuprofen are required in a day to maintain pharmacological action for a long duration of time. Due to multiple intakes of ibuprofen, certain severe adverse effects, such as gastric irritation, bleeding, ulcers, and abdominal pain are produced. Therefore, a system is needed which not only prolongs the release of ibuprofen but also overcomes the drug's adverse effects. Hence, the authors have synthesized chondroitin sulfate/sodium polystyrene sulfonate-co-poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels by the free radical polymerization technique for the controlled release of ibuprofen. Sol-gel, porosity, swelling, and drug release studies were performed on the fabricated hydrogel. The pH-responsive behavior of the fabricated hydrogel was determined by both swelling and drug release studies in three different pH values, i.e., pH 1.2, 4.6, and 7.4. Maximum swelling and drug release were observed at pH 7.4, as compared to pH 4.6 and 1.2. Similarly, the structural arrangement and crosslinking of the hydrogel contents were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluated the hard and irregular surface with a few macrospores of the developed hydrogel, which may be correlated with the strong crosslinking of polymers with monomer content. Similarly, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated the high thermal stability of the formulated hydrogel, as compared to pure polymers. A decrease in the crystallinity of chondroitin sulfate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate after crosslinking was revealed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD).

An aqueous insoluble hydrophobic anti-inflammatory compound, i.e., ibuprofen (IBU), was investigated in this study as the matrix-forming agent of a doxycycline hyclate (DH)-loaded solvent removal-induced in situ forming gel (ISG) using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and <i>N</i>-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvents. Their physicochemical properties, including pH, density, viscosity, surface tension, contact angle, water tolerance, injectability, mechanical properties, gel formation, and drug release, were determined. Their antimicrobial activities were tested using agar cup diffusion, and their anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using thermal inhibition of protein denaturation of egg albumin. Increasing the IBU content decreased the density, pH, surface tension, and contact angle but increased the viscosity, force and work of injection, and gel formation of IBU-based ISG solution. Although their water tolerance values decreased with the increase in IBU content, the addition of DH and the use of NMP led to high water tolerance. The characterization of the dried gel remnants of ISGs presented no change in IBU crystallinity and thermal properties and confirmed no chemical interaction among the components of ISGs. The obtained transformed IBU matrix prolonged the release of DH and IBU from ISGs over 7 days from its tortuously packed IBU matrix with small pores, and conformed well with Fickian diffusion mechanism.

Many methods-including pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and micro-assisted extraction (MAE)-have been employed for their extraction from both surface waters and biota. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) proved to be the best extraction method for these polar, non-volatile, and thermally unstable compounds in water. However, ultrasonic extraction works better for their isolation from sediment because it is cheap and consumes less solvent, even though SPE is preferred as a clean-up method for sediment samples. PPCPs are in groups of-acidic (e.g., diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen), neutral (e.g., caffeine, carbamazepine, fluoxetine), and basic pharmaceuticals, as well as antibiotics and estrogens amongst others. PPCPs which are present in trace levels (ng/L) are more often determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolent (HPLC-UV). Of these, LC-MS and LC-MS-MS are mostly employed for the analysis of this class of compounds, though not without a draw-back of matrix effect.

The very large number of CECs reported in the literature makes it difficult to interpret potential risks as well as the removal efficiencies, especially for the more recalcitrant compounds. As such, there is a need for indicator compounds that are representative of CECs detected in systems worldwide. In an effort to develop such a list, five criteria were used to address the potential for applying indicator compounds; these criteria include usage, occurrence, resistance to treatment, persistence, and physicochemical properties that shed light on the potential degradability of a class of compounds. Additional constraints applied included the feasibility of procuring and analyzing compounds. In total, 22 CECs belonging to 13 groups were selected as indicator compounds. These compounds include acetaminophen and ibuprofen (analgesic); erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim (antibiotics); diazepam and fluoxetine (antidepressants); carbamazepine (antiepileptic); atenolol and propranolol (β-blockers); gemfibrozil (blood lipid regulator); tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) (fire retardant); cotinine (nicotine metabolite); atrazine, metolachlor, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (pesticides); 17β-estradiol and cholesterol (steroids); caffeine (psychomotor stimulant); perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (surfactants); and iopromide (X-ray contrast agent). These thirteen groups of compounds represent CECs with the greatest resistance to treatment processes, most persistent in surface waters, and detected with significant frequency throughout the water cycle.

The results showed that most of the target metabolites and their parents were detected in all water samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 ng/L to 72.9 ng/L. In some cases, the concentrations of metabolites in water were significantly higher than their parents, with fold changes reaching up 4.1 in the wet season and 6.6 in the dry season, while in sediment and fish, a lower concentration was observed in most cases. A lowered concentration of detected pharmaceuticals was observed in the dry season when compared to the wet season due to the seasonal variation in pharmaceutical consumption and overflow effluent. The bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in different fish tissues were detected with a descending order of overall concentration as gill > brain > muscle > gonad > intestine > liver > blood. In addition, the concentrations of both metabolites and their parents also decreased along the river in two seasons. However, the concentration rates of metabolites and their parents were significantly altered along the river in both water and sediment. The relatively high concentration proportions of the detected pharmaceuticals in water suggested that pharmaceuticals were more likely to apportion in water than in sediment, especially for the metabolites. Meanwhile, the rates of the metabolite/parent pairs between fish and water/sediment were generally lower, indicating the higher excretion capacity of metabolites from fish than their parents. Most of the detected pharmaceuticals had no impact on aquatic organisms. However, the presence of ibuprofen posed a medium risk to fish. Compared to the parents, metabolites showed a relatively low risk value but a high contribution to the total risk.

Different tumor cells were treated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions with various drugs that affect cellular metabolism. HIF1α was silenced by siRNA in normoxic/hypoxic tumor cells, before RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed while using the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as a model. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed and validated by qPCR, while the activity of the metabolites was determined by enzyme assays. Under normoxic conditions, HIF1 activity was significantly increased by (i) glutamine metabolism, which was associated with the release of ammonium, and it was decreased by (ii) acetylation via acetyl CoA synthetase (ACSS2) or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), respectively, and (iii) the presence of L-ascorbic acid, citrate, or acetyl-CoA. Interestingly, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, L-ascorbic acid, and citrate each significantly destabilized HIF1α only under normoxia. The results from the deep sequence analyses indicated that, in HIF1-siRNA silenced MDA-MB-231 cells, 231 genes under normoxia and 1384 genes under hypoxia were transcriptionally significant deregulated in a HIF1-dependent manner. Focusing on glycolysis genes, it was confirmed that HIF1 significantly regulated six normoxic and 16 hypoxic glycolysis-associated gene transcripts. However, the results from the targeted metabolome analyses revealed that HIF1 activity affected neither the consumption of glucose nor the release of ammonium or lactate; however, it significantly inhibited the release of the amino acid alanine. This study comprehensively investigated, for the first time, how normoxic HIF1 is stabilized, and it analyzed the possible function of normoxic HIF1 in the transcriptome and metabolic processes of tumor cells in a breast cancer cell model.

To meet this need, hyaluronic acid (HA)/ibuprofen (IBU) (HAI) NFMs were prepared by electrospinning, followed by dual ionic crosslinking with FeCl<sub>3</sub> (HAIF NFMs) and covalent crosslinking with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to produce HAIFB NFMs. It is expected that the multi-functional NFMs will act as a physical barrier to prevent fibroblast penetration, HA will reduce fibroblast attachment and impart a lubrication effect for tendon gliding, while IBU will function as an anti-inflammation drug. For this purpose, we successfully fabricated HAIFB NFMs containing 20% (HAI20FB), 30% (HAI30FB), and 40% (HAI40FB) IBU and characterized their physico-chemical properties by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and mechanical testing. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that all NFMs except HAI40FB possessed excellent effects in preventing fibroblast attachment and penetration while preserving high biocompatibility without influencing cell proliferation. Although showing significant improvement in mechanical properties over other NFMs, the HAI40FB NFM exhibited cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts due to the higher percentage and concentration of IBU released form the membrane. In vivo studies in a rabbit flexor tendon rupture model demonstrated the efficacy of IBU-loaded NFMs (HAI30FB) over Seprafilm<sup>®</sup> and NFMs without IBU (HAFB) in reducing local inflammation and preventing tendon adhesion based on gross observation, histological analyses, and biomechanical functional assays.

The accelerating occurrence of AD is expected to reach 65.7 million by 2030. The disease results in neural atrophy and disrupted inter-neuronal connections. Amongst multiple AD pathogenesis hypotheses, the amyloid beta (Aβ) cascade is the most relevant and accepted form of the hypothesis, which suggests that Aβ monomers are formed as a result of the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), followed by the conversion of these monomers to toxic oligomers, which in turn develop β-sheets, fibrils and plaques. The review targets the events in the amyloid hypothesis and elaborates suitable therapeutic agents that function by hindering the steps of plaque formation and lowering Aβ levels in the brain. The authors discuss treatment possibilities, including the inhibition of β- and γ-secretase-mediated enzymatic cleavage of APP, the immune response generating active immunotherapy and passive immunotherapeutic approaches targeting monoclonal antibodies towards Aβ aggregates, the removal of amyloid aggregates by the activation of enzymatic pathways or the regulation of Aβ circulation, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-mediated curbed accumulation and the neurotoxic potential of Aβ aggregates, bapineuzumab-mediated vascular permeability alterations, statin-mediated Aβ peptide degradation, the potential role of ibuprofen and the significance of natural drugs and dyes in hindering the amyloid cascade events.

Ibuprofen and its amino acid ester salts-loaded BC membranes were prepared through a simple methodology and characterized in terms of structure and morphology. Two salts of amino acid isopropyl esters were used in the research, namely L-valine isopropyl ester ibuprofenate ([ValOiPr][IBU]) and L-leucine isopropyl ester ibuprofenate ([LeuOiPr][IBU]). [LeuOiPr][IBU] is a new compound; therefore, it has been fully characterized and its identity confirmed. For all membranes obtained the surface morphology, tensile mechanical properties, active compound dissolution assays, and permeation and skin accumulation studies of API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) were determined. The obtained membranes were very homogeneous. In vitro diffusion studies with Franz cells were conducted using pig epidermal membranes, and showed that the incorporation of ibuprofen in BC membranes provided lower permeation rates to those obtained with amino acids ester salts of ibuprofen. This release profile together with the ease of application and the simple preparation and assembly of the drug-loaded membranes indicates the enormous potentialities of using BC membranes for transdermal application of ibuprofen in the form of amino acid ester salts.",2021,,"Ossowicz-Rupniewska P, Rakoczy R, Nowak A, Konopacki M, Klebeko J, Świątek E, Janus E, Duchnik W, Wenelska K, Kucharski Ł, Klimowicz A.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/12/6252/pdf?version=1623380816,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The differences observed between human and rodent oligodendrocytes make animals inadequate for modeling these diseases. Although developing human in vitro models for oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons has been a great challenge, 3D cell cultures derived from iPSC are now available and able to partially reproduce the myelination process. We have previously developed a human iPSC-derived 3D brain organoid model (also called BrainSpheres) that contains a high percentage of myelinated axons and is highly reproducible. Here, we have further refined this technology by applying multiple readouts to study myelination disruption. Myelin was assessed by quantifying immunostaining/confocal microscopy of co-localized myelin basic protein (MBP) with neurofilament proteins as well as proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). Levels of PLP1 were also assessed by Western blot. We identified compounds capable of inducing developmental neurotoxicity by disrupting myelin in a systematic review to evaluate the relevance of our BrainSphere model for the study of the myelination/demyelination processes. Results demonstrated that the positive reference compound (cuprizone) and two of the three potential myelin disruptors tested (Bisphenol A, Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, but not methyl mercury) decreased myelination, while ibuprofen (negative control) had no effect.

The etiology and pathogenesis underlying the emergence of PD is still obscure. However, expanding corroboration encourages the involvement of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of PD. The destruction of numerous cellular components, namely oxidative stress, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction, autophagy-lysosome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation and programmed cell death, and mitochondrial dysfunction partake in the pathogenesis of PD. Present-day pharmacotherapy can alleviate the manifestations, but no therapy has been demonstrated to cease disease progression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-directed transcription factors pertaining to the class of nuclear hormone receptors (NHR), and are implicated in the modulation of mitochondrial operation, inflammation, wound healing, redox equilibrium, and metabolism of blood sugar and lipids. Numerous PPAR agonists have been recognized to safeguard nerve cells from oxidative destruction, inflammation, and programmed cell death in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, various investigations suggest that regular administration of PPAR-activating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen, indomethacin), and leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast) were related to the de-escalated evolution of neurodegenerative diseases. The present review elucidates the emerging evidence enlightening the neuroprotective outcomes of PPAR agonists in in vivo and in vitro models experiencing PD. Existing articles up to the present were procured through PubMed, MEDLINE, etc., utilizing specific keywords spotlighted in this review. Furthermore, the authors aim to provide insight into the neuroprotective actions of PPAR agonists by outlining the pharmacological mechanism.

Clay adsorbents have been repeatedly proposed as adsorbents for treatment purposes, but natural clays are hydrophilic and can be inefficient for catching hydrophobic pharmaceuticals. In this paper, a comparison of adsorption properties of pristine montmorillonite (MMT) and montmorillonite modified with stearyl trimethyl ammonium (hydrophobic MMT-STA) towards carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and paracetamol pharmaceuticals was performed. The efficiency of adsorption was investigated under varying solution pH, temperature, contact time, initial concentration of pharmaceuticals, and adsorbate/adsorbent mass ratio. MMT-STA was better than pristine MMT at removing all the pharmaceuticals studied. The adsorption capacity of hydrophobic montmorillonite to pharmaceuticals decreased in the following order: carbamazepine (97%) > ibuprofen (95%) > paracetamol (63-67%). Adsorption isotherms were best described by Freundlich model. Within the pharmaceutical concentration range of 10-50 µg/mL, the most optimal mass ratio of adsorbates to adsorbents was 1:300, pH 6, and a temperature of 25 °C. Thus, MMT-STA could be used as an efficient adsorbent for deconta×ating water of carbamazepine, ibuprofen, and paracetamol.",2021,,"Kryuchkova M, Batasheva S, Akhatova F, Babaev V, Buzyurova D, Vikulina A, Volodkin D, Fakhrullin R, Rozhina E.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/18/9670/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

There are currently no drugs that can successfully treat this disease. This study first explored the anti-inflammatory activity of seven components isolated from <i>Antrodia cinnamonmea</i> in BV2 cells and selected EK100 and antrodin C for in vivo research. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were treated with EK100 and antrodin C for one month to evaluate the effect of these reagents on AD-like pathology by nesting behavior, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. Ergosterol and ibuprofen were used as control. EK100 and antrodin C improved the nesting behavior of mice, reduced the number and burden of amyloid plaques, reduced the activation of glial cells, and promoted the perivascular deposition of Aβ in the brain of mice. EK100 and antrodin C are significantly different in activating astrocytes, regulating microglia morphology, and promoting plaque-associated microglia to express oxidative enzymes. In contrast, the effects of ibuprofen and ergosterol are relatively small. In addition, EK100 significantly improved hippocampal neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Our data indicate that EK100 and antrodin C reduce the pathology of AD by reducing amyloid deposits and promoting nesting behavior in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice through microglia and perivascular clearance, indicating that EK100 and antrodin C have the potential to be used in AD treatment.",2021,,"Tsay HJ, Liu HK, Kuo YH, Chiu CS, Liang CC, Chung CW, Chen CC, Chen YP, Shiao YJ.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/19/10413/pdf?version=1632962484,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Early in the pandemic, there was speculation that a number of commonly used medications-including ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-have the potential to upregulate ACE2, thereby possibly facilitating viral entry and increasing the severity of COVID-19. We investigated the influence of the NSAIDS with a range of cyclooxygenase (COX)1 and COX2 selectivity (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, etoricoxib) and paracetamol on the level of ACE2 mRNA/protein expression and activity as well as their influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection levels in a Caco-2 cell model. We also analysed the ACE2 mRNA/protein levels and activity in lung, heart and aorta in ibuprofen treated mice. The drugs had no effect on ACE2 mRNA/protein expression and activity in the Caco-2 cell model. There was no up-regulation of ACE2 mRNA/protein expression and activity in lung, heart and aorta tissue in ibuprofen-treated mice in comparison to untreated mice.

The replacement of chemical approaches with biocatalytic processes is advantageous in terms of environmental prevention, embracing the principles of green chemistry. In this work, we propose the covalent attachment of xylitol to ibuprofen to produce an IBU-xylitol ester prodrug. Xylitol was chosen as a hydrophilizer for the final prodrug, enhancing the water solubility of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) extensively used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Despite being the third-most-prescribed medicine in the world, the aqueous solubility of ibuprofen is just 21 mg/L. This poor water solubility greatly limits the bioavailability of ibuprofen. We aimed to functionalize ibuprofen with xylitol using the reusable immobilized N435 biocatalyst. Instead of a biphasic media, we proposed a monophasic reaction environment. The characterization of the IBU-xylitol ester was performed by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, DEPT, COSY, HMQC, HMBC, FTIR, and MS spectroscopy.

New indications for drugs used in various conditions are being discovered. Non-opioid analgesics are worth noting as very popular, widely available, relatively cheap medications. They also have the ability to modulate the membrane components of tumor cells. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol on skin and gastrointestinal cancers cell membrane. These drugs may affect the membrane through topical application, at the in vitro and in vivo level after oral or parenteral administration. They can lead to up- or downregulated expression of receptors, transporters and other molecules associated with plasma membrane. Medications may also alter the lipid bilayer composition of membrane, resulting in changes in its integrity and fluidity. Described modulations can cause the visualization of cancer cells, enhanced response of the immune system and the initiation of cell death.

Exposure of pregnant mice to NSAID therapeutic doses during the sex determination period has a negative impact on gonadal development and fertility in adults; however, the effects of their chronic exposure at lower doses are unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic exposure to a mixture containing ibuprofen, 2hydroxy-ibuprofen, diclofenac, and EE2 at two environmentally relevant doses (added to the drinking water from fetal life until puberty) on the reproductive tract in F1 exposed mice and their F2 offspring. In F1 animals, exposure delayed male puberty and accelerated female puberty. In post-pubertal F1 testes and ovaries, differentiation/maturation of the different gonad cell types was altered, and some of these modifications were observed also in the non-exposed F2 generation. Transcriptomic analysis of post-pubertal testes and ovaries of F1 (exposed) and F2 animals revealed significant changes in gene expression profiles and enriched pathways, particularly the inflammasome, metabolism and extracellular matrix pathways, compared with controls (non-exposed). This suggested that exposure to these drug cocktails has an intergenerational impact. The identified Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) networks for NSAIDs and EE2, at doses that are relevant to everyday human exposure, will improve the AOP network of the human reproductive system development concerning endocrine disruptor chemicals.

The composites consisted of biomimetic hydroxyapatite (mHA) enriched with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, type I collagen, alginate, and, additionally, chitosan and sericin. The granules were loaded with ibuprofen sodium salt. The investigation encompassed a morphology characterization, a porosity analysis, a chemical structure assessment, and an examination of the swelling behavior, drug release kinetics (ibuprofen), and release profiles of zinc and magnesium ions. The granules exhibited irregular surfaces with an enhanced homogeneity in the chitosan-coated granules and well-developed mesoporous structures. The FT-IR spectra confirmed the presence of ibuprofen sodium, despite overlapping bands for the polymers. The granules demonstrated a high water-absorption capacity, with delayed swelling observed in the chitosan-coated granules. Ibuprofen displayed burst-release profiles, especially in the G1 and G3 samples. In the case of the chitosan-coated granules (G2 and G4), lower amounts of ibuprofen were released. In turn, there was a significant difference in the released amount of magnesium and zinc ions from the granules, which was most likely caused by their different location in the hydroxyapatite crystals. The cytotoxicity assays confirmed the non-cytotoxic behavior of the biomaterial. These findings suggest the potential applicability of these biomaterials in dental scenarios, emphasizing their multifunctional and biocompatible nature.",2023,,"Kołodziejska B, Figat R, Kolmas J.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/16751/pdf?version=1700902868,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study aims to investigate whether oleocanthal-rich olive oils (OO), incorporated into a carbohydrate-rich meal, can affect postprandial dysmetabolism and platelet aggregation. Oleocanthal is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor with putative antiplatelet properties. In this randomized, single-blinded, crossover study, ten T2DM patients consumed five isocaloric meals containing 120 g white bread combined with: (i) 39 g butter, (ii) 39 g butter and 400 mg ibuprofen, (iii) 40 mL OO (phenolic content < 10 mg/Kg), (iv) 40 mL OO with 250 mg/Kg oleocanthal and (v) 40 mL OO with 500 mg/Kg oleocanthal. Metabolic markers along with ex vivo ADP- and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation were measured before and for 4 h after the meals. The glycemic and lipidemic response was similar between meals. However, a sustained (90-240 min) dose-dependent reduction in platelets' sensitivity to both ADP (50-100%) and TRAP (20-50%) was observed after the oleocanthal meals in comparison to OO or butter meals. The antiplatelet effect of the OO containing 500 mg/Kg oleocanthal was comparable to that of the ibuprofen meal.

With this in mind, we have developed a promising cell-based toxicity method that observes various cell responses when exposed to toxic substances (either death, division, or remain viable). Based on the collective cell response, we observed and predicted the dynamics of the cell population to determine the toxicity of the toxicant. The method was tested with two different conformations: In the first conformation, we exposed a monoculture model of blood macrophages to UV light, hydrogen peroxide, nutrient deprivation, tetrabromobisphenol A, fatty acids, and 5-fluorouracil.

A bi-directional relationship between DILI and MASLD is likely to exist: while certain drugs can cause MASLD by acting as pro-steatogenic factors, MASLD may make hepatocytes more vulnerable to drugs. Having a pre-existing MASLD significantly heightens the likelihood of experiencing DILI from certain medications. Thus, the prevalence of steatosis within DILI may be biased by pre-existing MASLD, and it can be concluded that the genuine true incidence of DIFLD in the general population remains unknown. In certain individuals, drug-induced steatosis is often accompanied by concomitant injury mechanisms such as oxidative stress, cell death, and inflammation, which leads to the development of drug-induced steatohepatitis (DISH). DISH is much more severe from the clinical point of view, has worse prognosis and outcome, and resembles MASH (metabolic-associated steatohepatitis), as it is associated with inflammation and sometimes with fibrosis. A literature review of clinical case reports allowed us to examine and evaluate the clinical features of DIFLD and their association with specific drugs, enabling us to propose a classification of DIFLD drugs based on clinical outcomes and pathological severity: Group 1, drugs with low intrinsic toxicity (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, irinotecan, methotrexate, and tamoxifen), but expected to promote/aggravate steatosis in patients with pre-existing MASLD; Group 2, drugs associated with steatosis and only occasionally with steatohepatitis (e.g., amiodarone, valproic acid, and tetracycline); and Group 3, drugs with a great tendency to transit to steatohepatitis and further to fibrosis. Different mechanisms may be in play when identifying drug mode of action: (1) inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation; (2) inhibition of fatty acid transport across mitochondrial membranes; (3) increased de novo lipid synthesis; (4) reduction in lipid export by the inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; (5) induction of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening; (6) dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential; (7) impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain/oxidative phosphorylation; (8) mitochondrial DNA damage, degradation and depletion; and (9) nuclear receptors (NRs)/transcriptomic alterations. Currently, the majority of, if not all, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for steatosis in AOP-Wiki highlight the interaction with NRs or transcription factors as the key molecular initiating event (MIE). This perspective suggests that chemical-induced steatosis typically results from the interplay between a chemical and a NR or transcription factors, implying that this interaction represents the primary and pivotal MIE. However, upon conducting this exhaustive literature review, it became evident that the current AOPs tend to overly emphasize this interaction as the sole MIE. Some studies indeed support the involvement of NRs in steatosis, but others demonstrate that such NR interactions alone do not necessarily lead to steatosis. This view, ignoring other mitochondrial-related injury mechanisms, falls short in encapsulating the intricate biological mechanisms involved in chemically induced liver steatosis, necessitating their consideration as part of the AOP's map road as well.",2024,,"López-Pascual E, Rienda I, Perez-Rojas J, Rapisarda A, Garcia-Llorens G, Jover R, Castell JV.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25105203,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We also investigated their effects on the human intestinal cell line Caco-2, assessing changes in DAO expression (both at the mRNA and protein levels) as well as DAO activity. The tested drugs, including ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, a combination of acetylsalicylic acid with paracetamol and caffeine, zolmitriptan, and sumatriptan, did not inhibit DAO activity or reduce their levels. However, naproxen reduced DAO protein levels in human enterocyte cultures while not affecting DAO activity. These results suggest that combining anti-inflammatory and anti-migraine drugs with DAO enzyme supplementation for migraine patients with DAO deficiency could be beneficial for healthcare professionals in their daily practice.",2023,,"Tobajas Y, Alemany-Fornés M, Samarra I, Romero-Giménez J, Tintoré M, Del Pino A, Canela N, Del Bas JM, Ortega-Olivé N, de Lecea C, Escoté X.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/23/7502/pdf?version=1701709211,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in reducing this pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. However, this mechanism may also interfere with orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) by affecting bone remodeling. This narrative review investigates the existing literature published between 2004 and 2024 to assess the impact of various NSAIDs on OTM and identify those that balance pain relief with minimal impact on tooth movement. Evidence shows that NSAIDs such as aspirin, ketorolac, diclofenac, and nimesulide significantly reduce OTM. The results for ibuprofen, meloxicam, and celecoxib were inconsistent with both no influence or a reduction in OTM, depending on dosage, mode, and duration of administration. Conversely, tenoxicam, nabumetone, etoricoxib, and parecoxib appear to have no effect on OTM. Among these, etoricoxib appears particularly promising due to its favorable gastrointestinal profile, high COX-2 selectivity, and negligible influence on OTM in clinical doses. However, the limited number of human trials highlights the need for further research to develop evidence-based guidelines for pain management that preserve treatment efficiency in orthodontics.",2025,,"Colceriu-Șimon IM, Feștilă D, Emoke H, Pancsur A, Șimon MȘ, Olteanu CD, Păstrav M, Bunta O, Ghergie M.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/14/9/2920/pdf?version=1745418839,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Many drugs can cause immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, but the most commonly implicated are abciximab, carbamazepine, ceftriaxone, eptifibatide, heparin, ibuprofen, mirtazapine, oxaliplatin, penicillin, quinine, quinidine, rifampicin, suramin, tirofiban, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Several different mechanisms have been identified in typical DITP, which is most commonly characterized by severe thrombocytopenia due to clearance and/or destruction of platelets sensitized by a drug-dependent antibody. Patients with typical DITP usually bleed when symptomatic, and biological confirmation of the diagnosis is often difficult because detection of drug-dependent antibodies (DDabs) in the patient's serum or plasma is frequently not possible. This is in contrast to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a particular DITP caused in most cases by heparin-dependent antibodies specific for platelet factor 4, which can strongly activate platelets in vitro and in vivo, explaining why affected patients usually have thrombotic complications but do not bleed. In addition, laboratory tests are readily available to diagnose HIT, unlike the methods used to detect DDabs associated with other DITP that are mostly reserved for laboratories specialized in platelet immunology.",2020,,"Vayne C, Guéry EA, Rollin J, Baglo T, Petermann R, Gruel Y.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/7/2212/pdf?version=1594634929,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To overcome this issue, the prior administration of high doses of HSA competitive binders, such as ibuprofen (IBF), has been proposed as a complementary clinical protocol to increase HD efficiency. In this work, we designed and prepared novel hybrid membranes conjugated with IBF, thus avoiding its administration to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Two novel silicon precursors containing IBF were synthesized and, by the combination of a sol-gel reaction and the phase inversion technique, four monophasic hybrid integral asymmetric cellulose acetate/silica/IBF membranes in which silicon precursors are covalently bonded to the cellulose acetate polymer were produced. To prove IBF incorporation, methyl red dye was used as a model, thus allowing simple visual color control of the membrane fabrication and stability.

However, their large-scale production and use worldwide cause their release to the environment. Pharmaceutical molecules are currently considered emerging pollutants that enter water bodies due to inadequate management, affecting water quality and generating adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Hence, different alternatives for pharmaceuticals removal from water have been sought; among them, the use of agro-industrial wastes has been proposed, mainly because of its high availability and low cost. This review highlights the adverse ecotoxicological effects related to the presence of different pharmaceuticals on aquatic environments and analyzes 94 investigations, from 2012 to 2024, on the removal of 17 antibiotics, highlighting sulfamethoxazole as the most reported, as well as 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac and ibuprofen, and 27 pharmaceutical drugs with different pharmacological activities. The removal of these drugs was evaluated using agro-industrial wastes such as wheat straw, mung bean husk, bagasse, bamboo, olive stones, rice straw, pinewood, rice husk, among others. On average, 60% of the agro-industrial wastes were transformed into biochar to be used as a biosorbents for pharmaceuticals removal. The diversity in experimental conditions among the removal studies makes it difficult to stablish which agro-industrial waste has the greatest removal capacity; therefore, in this review, the drug mass removal rate (DMRR) was calculated, a parameter used with comparative purposes. Almond shell-activated biochar showed the highest removal rate for antibiotics (1940 mg/g·h), while cork powder (CP) (10,420 mg/g·h) showed the highest for NSAIDs. Therefore, scientific evidence demonstrates that agro-industrial waste is a promising alternative for the removal of emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals substances.",2024,,"Estrada-Almeida AG, Castrejón-Godínez ML, Mussali-Galante P, Tovar-Sánchez E, Rodríguez A.",https://doi.org/10.3390/jox14040082,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Approximately 40% of the tested compounds were detected, at amounts ranging from below the methods' detection limits to 5623 ng/L (2-hydroxyibuprofen in surface water) and 12,664 ng/L (caffeine in wastewater). Twelve compounds (acetaminophen, ampicillin, azithromycin, caffeine, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mazindol, naproxen, and salicylic acid) were detected with a 100% frequency in both surface water and wastewater samples. The observed high detection frequency of pharmaceuticals within the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/analgesics, antibiotics, and psychiatric drug classes aligns with their high consumption. Caffeine was both the compound with the highest concentration and the most prevalent compound detected. Seasonal differences were observed, with higher concentrations detected during winter. Six of the eleven targeted metabolites and degradation products were detected in at least one sample. Risk quotient assessment revealed potential ecological risks, particularly for atorvastatin, caffeine, carbamazepine, and venlafaxine, exceeding risk thresholds for various trophic levels.

Despite its transformative potential, the adoption of PGx in Indian clinical practice faces challenges, such as the lack of population-specific data, evidence-based guidelines, and complexities in interpreting genomic reports. Comprehensive datasets tailored to Indian patients are essential to facilitate the integration of PGx into clinical settings.<h4>Methodology</h4>The study collates pharmacogenomic data from multiple sources, including essential drugs listed by the World Health Organization (WHO), drugs used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), minimum sets of alleles recommended by the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and catalogs the allele frequencies from the IndiGenomes database to address gaps in actionable PGx for the Indian population. Curated datasets were used to identify pharmacogenomic variants relevant to clinical practice.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 24 prime genes are essential for the outcomes of 57 drugs. In adults, 18 genes influence the metabolism of 44 drugs whereas, in pediatric populations, genotypes of 18 genes significantly impact the metabolism of 18 drugs. Two over-the-counter drugs with actionable PGx variants were identified: ibuprofen and omeprazole. These findings emphasize the clinical relevance of PGx for commonly used drugs, underscoring the need for population-specific data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As the data of several Indian human genome projects become available, an overarching need exists to establish and regulate the dynamic actionable PGx in Indian clinical practice.

We compared hydroactive nanocellulose-based, silver-impregnated and ibuprofen-containing foam wound dressings. Methods: A total of 46 patients scheduled for elective surgery were evaluated on the STSG donor site for wound healing (time-to-healing, Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale), pain level (Visual Analogue Scale), and handling (ease of use), as well as scar quality (Patient Scar Assessment Scale, Vancouver Scar Scale) after 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: Almost all dressings compared equally well. We observed statistically relevant differences for pain level favoring the ibuprofen-containing dressing (p = 0.002, ΔAIC = 8.1), and user friendliness in favor of nanocellulose (dressing removal: p = 0.037, ΔAIC = 2.59; application on patient: p = 0.042, ΔAIC = 2.33; wound adhesion: p = 0.017, ΔAIC = 4.16; sensation on skin: p = 0.027, ΔAIC = 3.21). We did not observe any differences for wound healing across all groups. Treatment with hydroactive nanocellulose and the ibuprofen-containing foam revealed statistically relevant better scar appearances as compared to the silver wound dressing (p < 0.001, ΔAIC = 14.77). Conclusion: All wound dressings performed equally well, with the detected statistical differences hinting future directions of clinical relevance. These include the reserved use of silver containing dressings for contaminated or close to contaminated wounds, and the facilitated clinical application of the nanocellulose dressing, which was the only suitable candidate in this series to be impregnated with a range of additional therapeutic agents (e.g., disinfectants and pain-modulating drugs).

For some, pain relief is insufficient, while others experience side effects. Although pharmacogenetic testing is rarely performed in the context of analgesics, response to opiates, non-opioid analgesics, and antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain can be affected by genetic variants. We describe a female patient who suffered from a complex chronic pain syndrome due to a disc hernia. Due to insufficient response to oxycodone, fentanyl, and morphine in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced side effects reported in the past, we performed panel-based pharmacogenotyping and compiled a medication recommendation. The ineffectiveness of opiates could be explained by a combined effect of the decreased activity in cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an increased activity in CYP3A, and an impaired drug response at the µ-opioid receptor. Decreased activity for CYP2C9 led to a slowed metabolism of ibuprofen and thus increased the risk for gastrointestinal side effects. Based on these findings we recommended hydromorphone and paracetamol, of which the metabolism was not affected by genetic variants. Our case report illustrates that an in-depth medication review including pharmacogenetic analysis can be helpful for patients with complex pain syndrome. Our approach highlights how genetic information could be applied to analyze a patient's history of medication ineffectiveness or poor tolerability and help to find better treatment options.",2023,,"Wiss FM, Stäuble CK, Meyer Zu Schwabedissen HE, Allemann SS, Lampert ML.",https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/13/5/829/pdf?version=1684125971,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Therefore, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are frequently used as a concomitant medication to reduce this risk. However, the impact of NSAIDs or metamizole, in combination with PPIs, on bone metabolism is still unclear. Therefore, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were cultured in monolayer cultures in 10 different groups for 21 days. New bone formation was induced as follows: Group 1 negative control group, group 2 osteogenic differentiation media (OSM), group 3 OSM with pantoprazole (PAN), group 4 OSM with ibuprofen (IBU), group 5 OSM with diclofenac (DIC), group 6 OSM with metamizole (MET), group 7 OSM with ibuprofen and pantoprazole (IBU + PAN), group 8 OSM with diclofenac and pantoprazole (DIC + PAN), group 9 OSM with metamizole and pantoprazole (MET + PAN) and group 10 OSM with diclofenac, metamizole and pantoprazole (DIC + MET + PAN). Hydroxyapatite content was evaluated using high-sensitive radioactive <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HDP labeling. Within this study, no evidence was found that the common analgetic medication, using NSAIDs alone or in combination with pantoprazole and/or metamizole, has any negative impact on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. To the contrary, the statistical results indicate that pantoprazole alone (group 3 (PAN) (<i>p</i> = 0.016)) or diclofenac alone (group 5 (DIC) (<i>p</i> = 0.008)) enhances the deposition of minerals by hMSCS in vitro. There is an ongoing discussion between clinicians in the field of orthopaedics and traumatology as to whether post-surgical (pain) medication has a negative impact on bone healing. This is the first hMSC in vitro study that investigates the effects of pain medication in combination with PPIs on bone metabolism. Our in vitro data indicates that the assumed negative impact on bone metabolism is subsidiary.

Wastewater treatment methods are not enough to completely remove active pharmaceuticals and other waste; thus, this study aims to assess the use of a multiwall carbon nanotube after derivatization and magnetization as a new and renewable absorbent for removing ibuprofen from an aqueous medium. The adsorbents were prepared by first oxidizing a multiwall carbon nanotube and then deriving the oxidized product with hydroxyl amine (m-MWCNT-HA), hydrazine (m-MWCNT-HYD), and amino acid (m-MWCNT-CYS). Adsorbents were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Batch adsorption studies were conducted to study the effects of pH, temperature, time, and initial concentration of the adsorbate. Adsorption isotherm, kinetics, and thermodynamics studies were also conducted. The results show that the optimal pH for nearly complete removal of Ibu in a short time at room temperature was 4 for three adsorbents. The adsorption followed the Langmuir isotherm model with pseudo-second-order kinetics. The percentage of removal of ibuprofen reached up to 98.4%, 93%, and 61.5% for m-MWCNT-CYS, m-MWCNT-HYD, and m-MWCNT-HA respectively.

The resulting hematite was investigated as adsorbent and photocatalyst for removal of ibuprofen as pharmaceutical waste. Hexagonal flake-like hematite was obtained following calcination at 500 °C with the average size was measured at 1-3 µm. Increasing the calcination temperature to 700 °C transformed the uniform hexagonal structure into cubic shape morphology. Hematite also showed high thermal stability with increasing the calcination temperatures; however, the surface area was reduced from 47 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 9 m<sup>2</sup>/g. FTIR analysis further confirmed the formation Fe-O-Fe bonds, and the main constituent elements of Fe and O were observed in EDX analysis for all samples. α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> samples have an average adsorption capacity of 55-25.5 mg/g at 12-22% of removal efficiency when used as adsorbent for ibuprofen. The adsorption capacity was reduced as the calcination temperatures increased due to the reduction of available surface area of the hexagonal flakes after transforming into cubes.

The percutaneous permeation across the human skin and transdermal diffusion test model (Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membranes) of ibuprofen and its structural modification were measured and compared using Franz diffusion cells. For comparison, the penetration of ibuprofen from a commercial product was also investigated.

TRPA1 channel significantly contributes to the activation of sensory neurons that initiate neurogenic inflammation and mediates pain signal transduction to the central nervous system. Peptide Ms 9a-1 from the sea anemone <i>Metridium senile</i> is a positive allosteric modulator of TRPA1 and shows significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in different models of pain. We used a model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of Ms 9a-1 in comparison with APHC3 (a polypeptide modulator of TRPV1 channel) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as meloxicam and ibuprofen.

The hybrid membranes can contribute to the advanced treatment of water and wastewater with low operational costs, and their application at a larger scale is viable.

Among these pharmaceutical products, ibuprofen (IBU) is one of the most consumed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and it can enter the environment though both human and animal consumption, because it is not entirely absorbed by the body, and the pharmaceutical industry wastewater. Nanofiltration has been described as an attractive process for the treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceutical products. In this paper, the modification of a polysulfone nanofiltration membrane by coating with graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been carried out. The morphology and elemental composition of the active layer of unmodified and modified membranes were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. Initial characterization membranes was carried out, studying their water permeability coefficient and their permeate flux and rejection coefficients, at different applied pressures, using magnesium chloride solutions. The behavior of both pristine and coated membranes against ibuprofen solutions were analyzed by studying the permeate fluxes and the rejection coefficients at different pressures and at different contaminant concentrations. The results have shown that both GO and RGO coated membranes lead to higher values of ibuprofene rejection than that of uncoated membrane, the latter being the one that presents better results in the studies of permeability, selectivity, and fouling.",2022,,"Hidalgo AM, Gómez M, Murcia MD, León G, Miguel B, Gago I, Martínez PM.",https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes12060562,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The principles of PMRs are based on photocatalytic degradation and membrane rejection, the different processes occurring simultaneously. Coupled photocatalysis and membrane filtration has made PMRs suitable for application in the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs), such as diclofenac, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, lincomycin, diphenhydramine, rhodamine, and tamoxifen, from wastewater, while reducing the likelihood of byproducts being present in the permeate stream. The viability of PMRs depends on the hypotheses used during design and the kinetic properties of the systems. The choice of design models and the assumptions made in their application can have an impact on reactor design outcomes. A design's resilience is due to the development of a mathematical model that links material and mass balances to various sub-models, including the fluid dynamic model, the radiation emission model, the radiation absorption model, and the kinetic model. Hence, this review addresses the discrepancies with traditional kinetic models, fluid flow dynamics, and radiation emission and absorption, all of which have an impact on upscaling and reactor design. Computational and analytical descriptions of how to develop a PMR system with high throughput, performance, and energy efficiency are provided. The potential solutions are classified according to the catalyst, fluid dynamics, thickness, geometry, and light source used. Two main PMR types are comprehensively described, and a discussion of various influential factors relating to PMRs was used as a premise for developing an ideal reactor. The aim of this work was to resolve potential divergences that occur during PMRs design as most real reactors do not conform to the idealized fluid dynamics. Lastly, the application of PMRs is evaluated, not only in relation to the removal of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) from wastewater, but also in dye, oil, heavy metals, and pesticide removal.",2022,,"Chakachaka V, Tshangana C, Mahlangu O, Mamba B, Muleja A.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/12/8/745/pdf?version=1660185713,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The membranes were characterized for various physical and chemical properties using techniques such as FTIR, SEM, AFM, TEM, EDS, and contact angle measurements. The membranes were then evaluated for their efficiency in rejecting EOCs and resistance to protein fouling. TEM micrographs showed uniform distribution of Ag/Pd nanoparticles within the PES matrix, while SEM images showed uniform, fingerlike structures that were not affected by the presence of embedded nanoparticles. The presence of Ag/Pd nanoparticles resulted in rougher membranes. There was an increase in membrane hydrophilicity with increasing nanoparticles loading, which resulted in improved pure water permeability (37−135 Lm2h−1bar−1). The membranes exhibited poor salt rejection (<15%), making them less susceptible to flux decline due to concentration polarization. With a mean pore radius of 2.39−4.70 nm, the membranes effectively removed carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, and naproxen (up to 40%), with size exclusion being the major removal mechanism.

The removal rate increased with the increase of the influent concentration and pre-membrane pressure, while pH influenced the removal effect of different PPCPs by affecting the electrostatic interaction between pollutants and membranes. It was also found that the dynamic adsorption of PPCPs on RO membranes under different conditions complied with the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic adsorption model. The maximum stable adsorption capacity and the adsorption rate of PPCPs on membranes under various conditions were simulated based on the model. Moreover, through factorial design, the removal rates of RO on IBU, CBZ, and TCS could reach 98.93%, 97.47%, and 99.01%, respectively, under the optimal conditions (with an influent concentration of 500 μg/L, pre-membrane pressure of 16 bar and pH = 10).

Due to poor bioavailability (~7%) and marked first-pass effect (~75%), including a short half-life (2-3 h), oral administration of VP is limited. It requires frequent administration of the drug to obtain a therapeutic effect. Attempts to overcome these difficulties include the use of new drug delivery systems and/or alternative routes of drug administration. One possibility is the common administration of lipid emulsion and drug using the same catheter. However, this procedure is not recommended due to potential interaction and lack of safety data. For this purpose, we checked the compatibility of VP solutions with eight commercially available parenteral nutrition admixtures, i.e., Lipoflex special, Omegaflex special, Lipoflex peri, Omegaflex peri, Kabiven, SmofKabiven, Kabiven Peripheral, and Olimel Peri N4E. Coadministration is only possible if the stability of the drug and the lipid emulsion is confirmed. The available data are scarce and only concern the incompatibility of VP with ibuprofen. Compatibility tests were carried out in simulated administration through a Y-site connector using clinical flow rates. The stability of the drug and lipid emulsion was assessed by visual inspection and measurement of pH, osmolality, particle size as mean droplet diameter (MDD) and percentage of lipids residing in globules larger than 5 µm (PFAT5), zeta potential, polydispersity index, and lipid-free parenteral nutrition admixture(PNA) turbidity. The results of the compatibility of VP with eight commercial PN admixtures showed that all lipid emulsions show different signs of destabilization. In the studied samples, particles larger than 1000 nm, a significant increase in MDD, zeta potential, and loss of homogeneity visible as an increase in the polydispersity index were observed. Most of the samples had PFAT5 above the USP limit (0.05%).

Polymeric microarray patches (MAPs) are minimally invasive devices that enable systemic delivery of a wide range of drugs by overcoming the outer skin barrier. Conventionally, MAPs fabricated by micromoulding have a low needle density. In this study, the performance of hydrogel-forming MAPs cast using novel industrially manufactured micromoulds with a high needle density (600 needles/0.75 cm<sup>2</sup>) was compared to that of MAPs obtained using conventional moulds with a lower density (196 needles/0.89 cm<sup>2</sup>). Surrounding holders for micromoulds were designed for time-efficient fabrication of MAPs. The influence of needle densities on mechanical strength, insertion efficiency and in vitro permeation of ibuprofen sodium (IBU) was analysed. Insertion of both MAPs into an artificial skin model and neonatal porcine skin was comparable. No significant difference was observed in permeation studies of IBU (<i>p</i> > 0.05), with a delivery of 8.7 ± 1.7 mg for low-density and 9.5 ± 0.1 mg for high-density MAPs within 24 h.

Thus, ibuprofen removal potentials and associated bacteria in the hyporheic zone sediments of an impacted river were investigated. Microbially mediated ibuprofen degradation was determined in oxic sediment microcosms amended with ibuprofen (5, 40, 200, and 400 µM), or ibuprofen and acetate, relative to an un-amended control. Ibuprofen was removed by the original sediment microbial community as well as in ibuprofen-enrichments obtained by re-feeding of ibuprofen. Here, 1-, 2-, 3-hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen were the primary transformation products. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher 16S rRNA abundance in ibuprofen-amended relative to un-amended incubations. Time-resolved microbial community dynamics evaluated by 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA analyses revealed many new ibuprofen responsive taxa of the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Latescibacteria, and Proteobacteria.

The in vitro suppression of oxidative burst of extract, fractions and isolated compounds was assessed through luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay. The in vivo analgesic activity was assayed in chemical and thermal induced nociceptive pain models. The crude methanol extract and its solvent fractions showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic responses, exhibited by significant amelioration of paw edema and relieve of the tonic visceral chemical and acute phasic thermal nociception. In the oxidative burst assay, based on IC50, the crude methanol extract and n-butanol soluble fraction produced a significant inhibition, followed by chloroform and hexane soluble fractions as compared to ibuprofen. Similarly, the isolated compounds pennogenin and borassoside E exhibited significant level of oxidative burst suppressive activity. The in vivo anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities as well as the in vitro inhibition of oxidative burst validated the traditional use of T. govanianum rhizomes as a phytotherapeutic remedy for both inflammatory conditions and pain. The observed activities might be attributed to the presence of steroids and steroid-based compounds. Therefore, the rhizomes of this plant species could serve as potential novel source of compounds effective for alleviating pain and inflammation.",2016,,"Ur Rahman S, Adhikari A, Ismail M, Raza Shah M, Khurram M, Shahid M, Ali F, Haseeb A, Akbar F, Iriti M.",https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/8/1095/pdf?version=1471690045,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The use of scientific and technological innovations as a research tool combining multidisciplinary knowledge in informatics, biotechnology, chemistry and biology are essential for optimizing time and reducing costs in the drug design. Thus, the integration of these in silico techniques makes it possible to search for new anti-inflammatory drugs with better pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles compared to commercially used drugs. This in silico study evaluated the anti-inflammatory potential of two benzoylpropionic acid derivatives (MBPA and DHBPA) using molecular docking and their thermodynamic profiles by molecular dynamics, in addition to predicting oral bioavailability, bioactivity and toxicity. In accordance to our predictions the derivatives proposed here had the potential capacity for COX-2 inhibition in the human and mice enzyme, due to containing similar interactions with the control compound (ibuprofen). Ibuprofen showed toxic predictions of hepatotoxicity (in human, mouse and rat; toxicophoric group 2-arylacetic or 3-arylpropionic acid) and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract (in human, mouse and rat; toxicophoric group alpha-substituted propionic acid or ester) confirming the literature data, as well as the efficiency of the DEREK 10.0.2 program.

In the present study, we designed a novel ibuprofen-containing radioligand (Ibu-PSMA-02) with subtle structural changes regarding the linker entity in order to investigate a potential impact on the in vitro and in vivo properties. Ibu-PSMA-02 was prepared using solid-phase synthesis techniques and labeled with lutetium-177.

Recently, we demonstrated that the TpBD-(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> covalent organic framework (COF) can adsorb ibuprofen from ultrapure water with high efficiency. Here, we investigate the performance of the COF for the extraction of ibuprofen from natural water samples from a lake, river, and estuary. In general, the complexity of the natural water matrix induced a reduction in the adsorption efficiency of ibuprofen as compared to ultrapure water. The best performance, with over 70% adsorption efficiency, was found in lake water, the sample which featured the lowest pH. According to the theoretical calculations, ibuprofen more favorably interacts with the COF pores in the protonated form, which could partially account for the enhanced adsorption efficiency found in lake water. In addition, we explored the effect of the presence of competing pharmaceuticals, namely, acetaminophen and phenobarbital, on the ibuprofen adsorption as binary mixtures. Acetaminophen and phenobarbital were adsorbed by TpBD-(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> with low efficiency and their presence led to an increase in ibuprofen adsorption in the binary mixtures.

Molecular cytotoxicity constitutes a limiting characteristic, especially for cationic and higher-generation dendrimers. Antineoplastic research of dendrimers has been widely developed, and several types of poly(amidoamine) and poly(propylene imine) dendrimer complexes with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, imatinib, sunitinib, cisplatin, melphalan and methotrexate have shown an improvement in comparison with the drug molecule alone. The anti-inflammatory therapy focused on dendrimer complexes of ibuprofen, indomethacin, piroxicam, ketoprofen and diflunisal. In the context of the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, dendrimer complexes of fluoroquinolones, macrolides, beta-lactamines and aminoglycosides have shown promising effects. Regarding antiviral therapy, studies have been performed to develop dendrimer conjugates with tenofovir, maraviroc, zidovudine, oseltamivir and acyclovir, among others. Furthermore, cardiovascular therapy has strongly addressed dendrimers. Employed in imaging diagnostics, dendrimers reduce the dosage required to obtain images, thus improving the efficiency of radioisotopes.

The anti-inflammatory effect of a γ-lactone (5-hexyl-3H-furan-2-one) isolated from ostrich oil and its formulated nano-emulsion in formalin-induced paw edema was investigated in this study. Ostrich oil was saponified using a standard procedure; the aqueous residue was fractionated, purified, and characterized as γ-lactone (5-hexyl-3H-furan-2-one) through the interpretation of IR, NMR, and MS analyses. The γ-lactone was formulated as nano-emulsion using methylcellulose (MC) for oral solubilized form. The γ-lactone methylcellulose nanoparticles (γ-lactone-MC-NPs) were characterized for their size, shape, and encapsulation efficiency with a uniform size of 300 nm and 59.9% drug content. The γ-lactone was applied topically, while the formulated nanoparticles (NPs) were administered orally to rats.

The essential oil was obtained by distillation using a Clavenger type apparatus. The chemical composition was analyzed by the GC-MS method. The major active compounds of <i>E. angustifolium</i> L. essential oil (EOEa) were terpenes, including α-caryophyllene oxide, eucalyptol, β-linalool, camphor, (S)-carvone, and β-caryophyllene. The analyzed essential oil was also characterized by antioxidant activity amounting to 78% RSA (Radical Scavenging Activity). Antifungal activity against the strains <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>A. ochraceus</i>, <i>A. parasiticum</i>, and <i>Penicillium cyclopium</i> was also determined.

It was found that the new compounds were more potent anti-inflammatory agents than the parent drugs. Thus, the ibuprofen (<b>21</b>) and ketoprofen (<b>16</b>) derivatives reduced rat paw edema by 67 and 91% (the reduction by the relevant NSAIDs was 36 and 47%, respectively). They inhibited COX-2 more than the starting drugs (<b>21</b> by 67%, ibuprofen 46%, <b>19</b> by 94%, ketoprofen 49%). Docking of compounds on the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 reflects their in vitro activity. Thus, <b>19</b> adopts an unfavorable orientation for COX-1 inhibition, but it binds effectively in the binding pocket of COX-2, in agreement with the absence of activity for COX-1 and the high inhibition of COX-2.

Although results have been encouraging, there is a need to improve the tumor residence time of current PSMA-based radiotherapeutics. Albumin-binding moieties have been used strategically to enhance the tumor uptake and retention of existing PSMA-based investigational agents. Previously, we developed a series of PSMA-based, β-particle-emitting, low-molecular-weight compounds. From this series, <sup>177</sup>Lu-L1 was selected as the lead agent because of its reduced off-target radiotoxicity in preclinical studies. The ligand L1 contains a PSMA-targeting Lys-Glu urea moiety with an N-bromobenzyl substituent in the ε-amino group of Lys. Here, we structurally modified <sup>177</sup>Lu-L1 to improve tumor targeting using two known albumin-binding moieties, 4-(<i>p</i>-iodophenyl) butyric acid moiety (IPBA) and ibuprofen (IBU), and evaluated the effects of linker length and composition. Six structurally related PSMA-targeting ligands (Alb-L1-Alb-L6) were synthesized based on the structure of <sup>177</sup>Lu-L1. The ligands were assessed for in vitro binding affinity and were radiolabeled with <sup>177</sup>Lu following standard protocols. All <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled analogs were studied in cell uptake and selected cell efficacy studies. In vivo pharmacokinetics were investigated by conducting tissue biodistribution studies for <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2-<sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 (2 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 192 h) in male NSG mice bearing human PSMA+ PC3 PIP and PSMA- PC3 flu xenografts. Preliminary therapeutic ratios of the agents were estimated from the area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-192h</sub>) of the tumors, blood, and kidney uptake values. Compounds were obtained in >98% radiochemical yields and >99% purity. PSMA inhibition constants (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>s) of the ligands were in the ≤10 nM range. The long-linker-based agents, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L5, displayed significantly higher tumor uptake and retention (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than the short-linker-bearing <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L3 and a long polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker-bearing agent, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6. The area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-192h</sub>) of the PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumor uptake of <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L5 were >4-fold higher than <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L3, and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6, respectively. Also, the PSMA+ PIP tumor uptake (AUC<sub>0-192h</sub>) of <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L2 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L3 was ~1.5-fold higher than <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6. However, the lowest blood AUC<sub>0-192h</sub> and kidney AUC<sub>0-192h</sub> were associated with <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 from the series. Consequently, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 displayed the highest ratios of AUC(tumor)-to-AUC(blood) and AUC(tumor)-to-AUC(kidney) values from the series. Among the other agents, <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 demonstrated a nearly similar ratio of AUC(tumor)-to-AUC(blood) as <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6. The tumor-to-blood ratio was the dose-limiting therapeutic ratio for all of the compounds. Conclusions: <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L4 and <sup>177</sup>Lu-Alb-L6 showed high tumor uptake in PSMA+ tumors and tumor-to-blood ratios.

Mechanical milling as well as mechanical milling combined with thermal annealing of the powder mixtures were applied as synthetic methods. Solubility and dissolution kinetics of the complexes were studied in compliance with European Pharmacopoeia (ICH Q4B). β-CD and citric acid (CA) molecules were shown to interact by both ball milling (BM), thermal annealing, as well as BM with subsequent annealing. Complexes were also formed by milling the three compounds (β-CD, CA and IBU) simultaneously, as well as by a consecutive first including IBU into β-CD and then binding the formed β-CD/IBU inclusion complex with CA. As a result, ternary β-CD/IBU/CA complex formed by initial incorporation of ibuprofen into β-CD, followed by successive formation of a two-phase mixture with CA, exhibited notably improved dissolution kinetics compared to the pure ibuprofen and slightly better compared to the binary β-CD/IBU system.

These compounds are indicated with the term emerging contaminants (or Contaminants of Emerging Concern, CECs) since they are potentially dangerous for the environment and human health. To date, among the most widely used methodologies for the removal of CECs from the aquatic environment, adsorption processes play a role of primary importance, as they have proven to be characterized by high removal efficiency, low operating and management costs, and an absence of undesirable by-products. In this paper, the adsorption of ibuprofen (IBU), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used for treating inflammation or pain, was performed for the first time using two different types of geopolymer-based materials, i.e., a metakaolin-based (GMK) and an organic-inorganic hybrid (GMK-S) geopolymer. The proposed adsorbing matrices are characterized by a low environmental footprint and have been easily obtained as powders or as highly porous filters by direct foaming operated directly into the adsorption column. Preliminary results demonstrated that these materials can be effectively used for the removal of ibuprofen from contaminated water (showing a concentration decrease of IBU up to about 29% in batch, while an IBU removal percentage of about 90% has been reached in continuous), thus suggesting their potential practical application.",2024,,"Paparo R, Di Serio M, Roviello G, Ferone C, Trifuoggi M, Russo V, Tarallo O.",https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29102210,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

EVOO is a rich source of bioactive compounds including fatty acids and phenolics; however, the biological activities of only a small subset of compounds associated with <i>Olea europaea</i> have been explored. Here, the OliveNet<sup>TM</sup> library (consisting of over 600 compounds) was utilized to investigate olive-derived compounds as potential modulators of the arachidonic acid pathway. Our first aim was to perform enzymatic assays to evaluate the inhibitory activity of a selection of phenolic compounds and fatty acids against COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) and 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX). Olive compounds were found to inhibit COX isoforms, with minimal activity against 15-LOX. Subsequent molecular docking indicated that the olive compounds possess strong binding affinities for the active site of COX isoforms, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the stability of binding. Moreover, olive compounds were predicted to have favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including a readiness to cross biological membranes as highlighted by steered MD simulations and umbrella sampling. Importantly, olive compounds including OLC were identified as non-inhibitors of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel based on patch clamp assays.

An ambient temperature upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was employed, followed by a two-stage (saturated and unsaturated) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) constructed wetland (CW) system, to treat domestic wastewater from a nearby settlement and investigate the occurrence and fate of 10 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in decentralized, non-conventional treatment systems. The integrated UASB-two-stage CW system achieved high performance regarding abatement of target CECs across all periods. Removal efficiencies ranged from 78% ± 21% (ketoprofen) to practically 100% (2-hydroxybenzothiazole). The pilot system was found to be robust performance-wise and provided enhanced treatment in comparison to a conventional wastewater treatment plant operating in parallel. Most of the target CECs were successfully treated by UASB, saturated and unsaturated CWs, while ibuprofen, bisphenol A and diclofenac were mostly removed in the unsaturated CW.

Due to the vasodilatation caused by nitrogen monoxide, NO-donors have been shown to protect endothelial function, acting as vasodilators, promoting efficient oxygen supply to tissues, to lower blood pressure, and to inhibit platelet aggregation. Incorporation of a NO-liberating moiety in the structure of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in anti-inflammatory agents that are safer for the gastrointestinal system. In this research, ibuprofen and naproxen, two commonly applied non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), non-selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenases, were used to design novel anti-inflammatory agents able to release NO in the organism. Thus, the NSAIDs were amidated with beta-alanine and L-proline, which were able to incorporate the 2-nitro-oxyethyl moiety as the NO donor. The resulting compounds were anti-inflammatory agents, found to be more potent than the mother drugs, demonstrating remarkable inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 and the ability to release NO in vitro. Furthermore, two of the most active anti-inflammatory compounds proved to be effective hypolipidemic agents, decreasing plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol in hyperlipidemic rats significantly. The most effective compound in all the above tests was the ibuprofen derivative 5, which inhibited COX-2 by 95%, decreased inflammation by 73%, and reduced all lipidemic indices by more than 50%. Furthermore, docking experiments of compound 5 on the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 showed that it interacts intensely with the binding site of COX-2, and the binding energy is equivalent to that of the relevant to celecoxib selective COX-2 inhibitor 4-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide (SC-5580). In conclusion, the performed structural modifications resulted not only in the improvement of the anti-inflammatory activity, compared with the parent NSAID, but also acquired strong hypolipidemic activity. Thus, the combination of structural characteristics resulting in a decrease in lipidemia, with possible inhibition of atherosclerosis, due to their anti-inflammatory activity and vasodilatation ability, via the liberated NO, may constitute a useful rationale for new compounds.",2025,,"Tziona P, Theodosis-Nobelos P, Lepesiotis D, Gavalas A, Rekka EA.",https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules30183744,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In detail, rod-like (diameter ca. 250 nm, length ca. 700 nm) and spherical (diameter approximately 120 nm) OMCs were synthesized by nanocasting selected templates and loaded with ibuprofen through a melt infiltration method to achieve complete filling of their pores (100% loading yield).

Driven by this need, this study reports, for the first time, the removal of pharmaceuticals from real contaminated water samples using porous graphene (PG) as a filter-based column. This work systematically evaluates the performance of PG as a filter medium for the removal of widely consumed pharmaceutical/emerging contaminants (ECs) such as atenolol, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. Several factors were investigated in these column studies, including different reactive layer configurations, bed packing heights (5-45 mm), filter sizes (inner diameter 18-40 mm), adsorbent dosages (100-500 mg-PG) and water bodies (distilled water, greywater, and actual effluent wastewater). Sustainable synthesis of PG was carried out followed by its use as a filter medium for the removal of pharmaceuticals at high concentrations (10.5 ± 0.5 mg/L) and trace concentrations (1 mg/L). These findings revealed that the double-layered PG-sand column outperformed a PG single-layered configuration for the removal of most of the ECs. The removal efficiency of ECs from their solutions was improved by increasing PG dosages and filter bed height and size. Although the treatment of mixed pharmaceutical solutions from different water bodies was affected by the negative interference caused by competing water compounds, the treatment of ECs-contaminated greywater was not severely affected.

Activated carbons prepared from acid-char carbonized with 13.5 M and 12 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are mainly microporous solids composed of compact rough particles, yielding a maximum surface area and a total pore volume of 1987 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.96 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Solid state NMR reveals that steam activation increased the aromaticity degree and amount of C=O functionalities. Steam activation improved the acid-chars adsorption capacity for ibuprofen from 20-65 mg g<sup>-1</sup> to higher than 280 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, leading to fast adsorption kinetics (15-20 min). The maximum adsorption capacities of selected activated samples for ibuprofen and iopamidol were 323 and 1111 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.",2022,,"Hubetska TS, Mestre AS, Kobylinska NG, Carvalho AP.",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/19/3480/pdf?version=1665371321,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Micro Raman analysis confirmed polymer functionalisation of CA membranes and drug incorporation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images evidenced the presence of PPy and PEDOT coatings. The kinetic of drug release was analysed, and the passive and active release was compared. In the proposed systems, the drug release is controlled by very low electrical potentials. A potential of -0.3 V applied to membranes showed the ibuprofen retention, and a positive potential of +0.3 V, +0.5 V, or +0.8 V, depending on the conductive polymer and membrane configuration, enhanced the drug release.

Traditional treatment methods often fail to adequately degrade these contaminants. This study explored the efficacy of a hybrid ozonation membrane filtration (HOMF) process using CeO<sub>2</sub> and CeTiO<sub>x</sub>-doped ceramic crossflow ultrafiltration ceramic membranes for the degradation of OMPs. Hollow ceramic membranes (CM) with a 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) were modified to serve as substrates for catalytic nanosized metal oxides in a crossflow and inside-out operational configuration. Three types of depositions were tested: a single layer of CeO<sub>2</sub>, a single layer of CeTiO<sub>x</sub>, and a combined layer of CeO<sub>2</sub> + CeTiO<sub>x</sub>. These catalytic nanoparticles were distributed uniformly using a solution-based method supported by vacuum infiltration to ensure high-throughput deposition. The results demonstrated successful infiltration of the metal oxides, although the yield permeability and transmembrane flow varied, following this order: pristine > CeTiO<sub>x</sub> > CeO<sub>2</sub> > CeO<sub>2</sub> + CeTiO<sub>x</sub>. Four OMPs were examined: two easily degraded by ozone (carbamazepine and diclofenac) and two recalcitrant (ibuprofen and pCBA). The highest OMP degradation was observed in demineralized water, particularly with the CeO<sub>2</sub> + CeTiO<sub>x</sub> modification, suggesting O<sub>3</sub> decomposition to hydroxyl radicals. The increased resistance in the modified membranes contributed to the adsorption phenomena. The degradation efficiency decreased in secondary effluent due to competition with the organic and inorganic load, highlighting the challenges in complex water matrices.",2024,,"Tsiarta N, Morović S, Mandić V, Panžić I, Blažic R, Ćurković L, Gernjak W.",https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14131163,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Nucleotide mutations of the RNA polymerase 3 subunit b (polr3b) gene are responsible for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 8 (HLD8), which is an autosomal recessive oligodendroglial cell disease. Despite the important association between POLR3B mutation and HLD8, it remains unclear how mutated POLR3B proteins cause oligodendroglial cell abnormalities. Herein, we show that a severe HLD8-associated nonsense mutation (Arg550-to-Ter (R550X)) primarily localizes POLR3B proteins as protein aggregates into lysosomes in the FBD-102b cell line as an oligodendroglial precursor cell model. Conversely, wild type POLR3B proteins were not localized in lysosomes. Additionally, the expression of proteins with the R550X mutation in cells decreased lysosome-related signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Cells harboring the mutant constructs did not exhibit oligodendroglial cell differentiated phenotypes, which have widespread membranes that extend from their cell body. However, cells harboring the wild type constructs exhibited differentiated phenotypes. Ibuprofen, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), improved the defects in their differentiation phenotypes and signaling through mTOR. These results indicate that the HLD8-associated POLR3B proteins with the R550X mutation are localized in lysosomes, decrease mTOR signaling, and inhibit oligodendroglial cell morphological differentiation, and ibuprofen improves these cellular pathological effects. These findings may reveal some of the molecular and cellular pathological mechanisms underlying HLD8 and their amelioration.",2022,,"Sawaguchi S, Suzuki R, Oizumi H, Ohbuchi K, Mizoguchi K, Yamamoto M, Miyamoto Y, Yamauchi J.",https://www.mdpi.com/2035-8377/14/1/18/pdf?version=1648104487,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Currently available AD treatments only exhibit symptomatic relief but do not generally intervene with the amyloid and tau pathologies. The extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) monophenolic secoiridoid <i>S</i>-(-)-oleocanthal (OC) showed anti-inflammatory activity through COX system inhibition with potency comparable to the standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen. OC also showed positive in vitro, in vivo, and clinical therapeutic effects against cardiovascular diseases, many malignancies, and AD. Due to its pungent, astringent, and irritant taste, OC should be formulated in acceptable dosage form before its oral use as a potential nutraceutical.

Furthermore, this study examined the need for Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) by comparing their effects with a placebo group. This study enrolled 42 individuals requiring the extraction of a single mandibular third molar under local anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned to receive Brome-Inf<sup>®</sup>, purified bromelain, or a placebo orally, initiating treatment on the day of surgery and continuing for the next 7 days. The primary outcome measured was the requirement for NSAIDs in the three groups. Pain, swelling, and trismus were secondary outcome variables, evaluated postoperatively at 1, 3, and 7 days. This study also assessed the comparative efficacy of freeze-dried pineapple extract and single-component bromelain. Ultimately, the placebo group showed a statistically higher need for ibuprofen (from days 1 to 7) at the study's conclusion (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In addition, reductions in pain and swelling were significantly higher in both the bromelain and pineapple groups (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 for almost all patients, at all intervals) than in the placebo group. The active groups also demonstrated a significant difference in QoL compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). A non-significant reduction in trismus occurred in the treatment groups compared to the placebo group. Therefore, the administration of pineapple extract titrated in bromelain showed significant analgesic and anti-edema effects in addition to improving QoL in the postoperative period for patients who had undergone mandibular third molar surgery. Moreover, both bromelain and Brome-Inf<sup>®</sup> supplementation reduced the need for ibuprofen to comparable extents, proving that they are good alternatives to NSAIDs in making the postoperative course more comfortable for these patients.

Toxicity profile was conducted in Human Colon Epithelial Cells (HCEC) and Balb/c mice. Anti-inflammatory potential was explored in a collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) mice model. Bioactive compounds were identified computationally from GCMS data and subjected to docking and simulation studies against COX2 and TNFα.<h4>Results</h4>CLHE demonstrated significant antioxidant (IC-50 = 6.78 µg/mL) and anti-inflammatory (IC-50 = 97.39 µg/mL) activity. It maintained 50% cell viability at 78.5 μg/µL in HCEC cells and exhibited no toxicity at a dose of 5000 mg/kg in mice.

Gagam-Sipjeondaebo-Tang (GST), a traditional herbal formula made of twelve medicinal herbs, is known to be effective in PD, and the use of ibuprofen has been associated with a lower risk of PD. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the combined administration of GST and ibuprofen affects the inflammatory response of Parkinson's disease. MPTP-induced parkinsonian mouse models were treated with GST or ibuprofen using oral gavage once a day for 5 days. The effects of GST were examined by measuring the TH level and expression of CD68 in the mice brain in addition to behavioral tests. The anti-inflammatory effect of GST on the LPS-treated RAW264.7 murine macrophages was examined using the NO assay. Inflammatory cytokines were analyzed using quantitative-PCR and flow cytometry. In the results, GST significantly improved the loss of dopaminergic neurons and alleviated PD-induced behavioral deficits. GST also decreased macrophage activation in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model. Interestingly, co-administration of GST and ibuprofen showed a synergistic effect in improving the loss of dopaminergic neurons and decreasing the activation of macrophages. Moreover, the NO level decreased in LPS-stimulated macrophages with this combined treatment. GST reduced iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels, and co-administration with ibuprofen showed a synergistic effect.

Additionally, our results show significant synergy between water soluble Na-ibuprofen (IBU-Na) and ionic strength. Salt concentrations above 0.5 M modify the zeta potential promoting the action of Na-IBU; thus, with 1 M sodium chloride, IBU-Na is ten times more efficient than in the absence of ionic strength, and the minimum effective contact time is reduced from hours to minutes. In short time periods, where neither IBU-Na nor controls with 1 M NaCl show activity, the combination of both leads to a reduction in the bacterial load. We also analyzed whether the changes caused by salt on the bacterial membrane also promoted the activity of other microbicide compounds used in cystic fibrosis like gentamicin, tobramycin and phosphomycin. The results show that the presence of ionic strength only enhanced the bactericidal activity of the amphipathic molecule of IBU-Na. In this respect, the effect of saline concentration was also reflected in the surface properties of IBU-Na, where, in addition to the clear differences observed between 145 mM and 1 M, singular behaviors were also found, different in each condition.

D-galactose is a simple, naturally occurring monosaccharide sugar that has been extensively studied for use as a carrier and has proven to be valuable in this role. With the aim of validating the galactose-prodrug approach, we have investigated the galactosylated prodrugs ibuprofen, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen and indomethacin, which we have named IbuGAL, OkyGAL, FluGAL and IndoGAL, respectively. Their physicochemical profiles in terms of lipophilicity, solubility and chemical stability have been evaluated at different physiological pH values, as have human serum stability and serum protein binding. Ex vivo intestinal permeation experiments were performed to provide preliminary insights into the oral bioavailability of the galactosylated prodrugs. Finally, their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and ulcerogenic activities were investigated in vivo in mice after oral treatment. The present results, taken together with those of previous studies, undoubtedly validate the galactosylated prodrug strategy as a problem-solving technique that can overcome the disadvantages of NSAIDs.",2022,,"Sodano F, Cristiano C, Rolando B, Marini E, Lazzarato L, Cuozzo M, Albrizio S, Russo R, Rimoli MG.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15050552,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, few studies have been explored to provide evidence of the possible synergism between a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and a cannabinoid agonist, in order to establish which combinations might be effective to manage pain. The aim of this study was to explore the synergism between ibuprofen (IBU) and the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) to improve pain relief by analyzing the degree of participation of the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> cannabinoid receptors in the possible antinociceptive synergism using an experimental model of pain in Wistar rats. First, the effective dose thirty (ED<sub>30</sub>) of IBU (10, 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg, subcutaneous) and WIN (3, 10, and 30 µg/p, intraplantar) were evaluated in the formalin test. Then, the constant ratio method was used to calculate the doses of IBU and WIN to be administered in combination (COMB) to determine the possible synergism using the isobolographic method. The participation of the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors was explored in the presence of the antagonists AM281 and AM630, respectively. The combination of these drugs produced a supra-additive response with an interaction index of 0.13. In addition, AM281 and AM630 antagonists reversed the synergistic effect in 45% and 76%, respectively, suggesting that both cannabinoid receptors are involved in this synergism, with peripheral receptors playing a relevant role.

Despite the satisfactory results achieved by oral analgesics, parenteral analgesia remains a key tool in the treatment of painful conditions when the enteral routes of administration are inconvenient. Parenteral ready-to-use fixed-dose combinations of non-opioid analgesics combinations, including NSAIDs and paracetamol or metamizole, could play a central role in the treatment of painful conditions by combining the advantages of multimodal and parenteral analgesia in a single formulation. Surprisingly, only in 2020, a parenteral ready-to-use fixed-dose combination of ibuprofen/paracetamol was launched to the market. This review aims to investigate the current availability of combinations of NSAIDs with paracetamol or metamizole in both European and American markets, and how the combination of such drugs could play a central role in a multimodal analgesia strategy. Also, we explored how the parenteral formulations of NSAIDs, paracetamol, and metamizole could serve as starting elements for the development of new parenteral ready-to-use fixed-dose combinations. We concluded that, despite the well-recognized utility of combining NSAIDs with paracetamol or metamizole, several randomized clinical trial studies demonstrate no clear advantages concerning their efficacy and safety.

Besides their recognized anti-inflammatory effects, these drugs exhibit various other pleiotropic effects in several cells, including platelets. Within this article, the multifaceted properties of NSAIDs on platelet functions, activation and viability, as well as their interaction(s) with established antiplatelet medications, by hindering several platelet agonists' pathways and receptors, are thoroughly reviewed. The efficacy and safety of NSAIDs as adjunctive therapies for conditions involving inflammation and platelet activation are also discussed.

Powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption analysis, and ethanol extraction coupled with ultraviolet spectroscopy were employed to characterize the samples and quantify drug loading. Successful results were obtained with IBU and CTZ while HC loading was negligible, which could be related to different solubilities in CO<sub>2</sub>, drug size, and polarity. Successful SSI resulted in amorphous multilayer confinement of the drug. The mesoNsZnO-IBU system showed double drug loading than the mesoNsZnO-CTZ one, with a maximum uptake of 0.24 g/g. Variation of contact time during SSI of the mesoNsZnO-IBU system showed that drug loading triplicated between 3 and 8 h with an additional 30% increment between 8 h and 24 h. SSI did not affect the mesoNsZnO structure, and the presence of the adsorbed drug reduced the chemisorption of CO<sub>2</sub> on the carrier surface.",2019,,"Banchero M, Mohamed SSY, Leone F, Lopez F, Ronchetti S, Manna L, Onida B.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/11/7/340/pdf?version=1563427187,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this work, copper-substituted bioactive mesoporous glasses (Cu-MBGs) were prepared as nano- and micro-particles and successfully loaded with ibuprofen through an incipient wetness method (loaded ibuprofen approx. 10% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>). Injectable hybrid formulations were then developed by dispersing ibuprofen-loaded Cu-MBGs within thermosensitive hydrogels based on a custom-made amphiphilic polyurethane. This procedure showed almost no effects on the gelation potential (gelation at 37 °C within 3-5 min). Cu<sup>2+</sup> and ibuprofen were co-released over time in a sustained manner with a significantly lower burst release compared to MBG particles alone (burst release reduction approx. 85% and 65% for ibuprofen and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, respectively).

The treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) aims to reduce pain and improve function. An innovative magnetophoresis technology has been developed that facilitates transdermal delivery of ibuprofen. The study used measures that were taken over a relatively short time period to monitor the pharmacodynamic response to ibuprofen. Each participant received magnetophoresis-enhanced transdermal ibuprofen or placebo in randomised order, with a five-day washout period. The participants were 24 volunteers with medically diagnosed, painful knee OA. The primary outcome measures were VAS rating of pain on movement and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain and function scores. VAS for pain on movement (<i>p</i> < 0.001), WOMAC pain score (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and WOMAC function score (<i>p</i> = 0.004) were all significantly improved. There was a significant reduction in movement-related pain (<i>p</i> < 0.05) during the first patch application and for the remainder of the study period. The number needed to treat for a 50% reduction in movement related pain was 2.2. The study showed a rapid and significant analgesic effect in response to transdermal ibuprofen.

Fully relying on these models as a surrogate tool requires continuous optimization and validation. To do so, intraluminal and systemic data are desirable to judge the predicted outcomes. The aim of this study was to predict the systemic concentrations of ibuprofen after oral administration of an 800 mg immediate-release (IR) tablet to healthy subjects in fasted-state conditions. A mechanistic oral absorption model coupled with a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) model was built in Phoenix WinNonlinWinNonlin<sup>®</sup> software and in the GastroPlus™ simulator. It should be noted that all simulations were performed in an ideal framework as we were in possession of a plethora of in vivo data (e.g., motility, pH, luminal and systemic concentrations) in order to evaluate and optimize these models. All this work refers to the fact that important, yet crucial, gastrointestinal (GI) variables should be integrated into biopredictive dissolution testing (low buffer capacity media, considering phosphate versus bicarbonate buffer, hydrodynamics) to account for a valuable input for physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) platform programs. While simulations can be performed and mechanistic insights can be gained from such simulations from current software, we need to move from correlations to predictions (IVIVC → IVIVP) and, moreover, we need to further determine the dynamics of the GI variables controlling the dosage form transit, disintegration, dissolution, absorption and metabolism along the human GI tract. Establishing the link between biopredictive in vitro dissolution testing and mechanistic oral absorption modeling (i.e., physiologically-based biopharmaceutics modeling (PBBM)) creates an opportunity to potentially request biowaivers in the near future for orally administered drug products, regardless of its classification according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS).",2020,,"Bermejo M, Hens B, Dickens J, Mudie D, Paixão P, Tsume Y, Shedden K, Amidon GL.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12010074,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Most significantly, the delivery of lower doses of drug, thus, potentially reducing side-effects and improving patient compliance. Three dimensional (3D) printing is a flexible technique, which has been subject to increasing interest in the past few years, especially in the area of medical devices. The present work focussed on the use of 3D printing as a tool to manufacture implantable drug delivery devices to deliver a range of model compounds (methylene blue, ibuprofen sodium and ibuprofen acid) in two in vitro models.

However, several factors such as skin, physicochemical properties of the drug, and vehicle characteristics influence the permeation. Within a formulation, critical factors such as concentration of drug, physical state of drug in the formulation, and organoleptic properties affect the flux across the skin. The aim of the study was to develop and investigate topical semisolid preparations (creams and gels) with ibuprofen as the model drug and investigate the effect of various formulation parameters on the in-vitro performance across the Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane using flow-through cells. In addition, the physical stability of the developed formulations was investigated by studying viscosity, pH, and appearance. All the formulations developed in the study had appealing appearance with smooth texture and no signs of separation. Viscosity and pH of the formulations were acceptable. Cumulative amount of drug permeated at the end of 24 h was highest for clear gel (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> ibuprofen; F6: 739.6 ± 36.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>) followed by cream with high concentration of ibuprofen in suspended form (5% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>; F3: 320.8 ± 17.53 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), emulgel (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> ibuprofen; F5: 178.5 ± 34.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and cream with solubilized ibuprofen (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>; F2A: 163.2 ± 9.36 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>). Results from this study showed that permeation of ibuprofen was significantly influenced by formulation parameters such as concentration of ibuprofen (3% vs. 5% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), physical state of ibuprofen (solubilized vs. suspended), formulation type (cream vs. gel), mucoadhesive agents, and viscosity (high vs. low).

To optimize formulations destined for the vaginal site, it is important to evaluate the drug retention within the vagina as well as its permeation across the mucosa, particularly in the presence of vaginal fluids. Herewith, the vaginal-PVPA (Phospholipid Vesicle-based Permeation Assay) in vitro permeability model was validated as a tool to evaluate the permeation of the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen from liposomal formulations (i.e., plain and chitosan-coated liposomes). Drug permeation was assessed in the presence and absence of mucus and simulated vaginal fluid (SVF) at pH conditions mimicking both the healthy vaginal premenopausal conditions and vaginal infection/pre-puberty/post-menopause state. The permeation of ibuprofen proved to depend on the type of formulation (i.e., chitosan-coated liposomes exhibited lower drug permeation), the mucoadhesive formulation properties and pH condition.

However, the application of mechanically and thermally intensive processes is not straightforward in the cases of ductile and/or low melting point substances that may additionally be susceptible to eutectic formation. Using ibuprofen (IBU) as a model drug with non-favorable mechanical and melting properties, we attempt to rationalize nanocrystal formulation and manufacturing in an integrated approach by implementing Quality by Design (QbD) methodology, particle informatics techniques and computationally assisted process design. Wet media milling was performed in the presence of different stabilizers and co-milling agents, and the nanosuspensions were solidified by spray-drying. The effects of key process parameters (bead diameter, milling time and rotational speed) and formulation variables (stabilizer type and drug/stabilizer ratio) on the critical quality attributes (CQAs), i.e., Z-average size, polydispersity index (PDI), ζ-potential and redispersibility of spray-dried nanosuspensions were evaluated, while possible correlations between IBU free surface energy and stabilizer effectiveness were studied. The fracture mechanism and surface stabilization of IBU were investigated by computer simulation of the molecular interactions at the crystal lattice level. As a further step, process design accounting for mass-energy balances and predictive thermodynamic models were constructed to scale-up and optimize the design space.

Here, a biomimetic artificial membrane permeability assay (Franz-PAMPA Pampa) was validated using a Franz cells apparatus. Both high and low permeability drugs (metoprolol and mannitol, respectively) were used as external standards. Biomimetic properties of Franz-PAMPA were also characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Moreover, the permeation profile for eight Biopharmaceutic Classification System (BCS) model drugs cited in the FDA guidance and another six drugs (acyclovir, cimetidine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam, and trimethoprim) were measured across Franz-PAMPA. Apparent permeability (Papp) Franz-PAMPA values were correlated with fraction of dose absorbed in humans (Fa%) from the literature. Papp in Caco-2 cells and Corti artificial membrane were likewise compared to Fa% to assess Franz-PAMPA performance. Mannitol and metoprolol Papp values across Franz-PAMPA were lower (3.20 × 10<sup>-7</sup> and 1.61 × 10<sup>-5</sup> cm/s, respectively) than those obtained across non-impregnated membrane (2.27 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and 2.55 × 10<sup>-5</sup> cm/s, respectively), confirming lipidic barrier resistivity.

The size reduction makes the eutectic formation a viable option to improve the dissolution rate of the poorly soluble APIs. In the present study, ibuprofen, naproxen, and sorafenib were investigated in terms of their phase behaviors with fatty alcohols, such as tetradecanol, octadecanol, and docosanol. Among the studied APIs, only ibuprofen was able to form eutectics with the fatty alcohols, and this was in agreement with the feasibility prediction based on the van 't Hoff equation and solubility parameters. In vitro release behavior was significantly improved for the ibuprofen/octadecanol eutectic mixture, although the practical insolubility of octadecanol in water was the opposite of the outstanding hydrophilicity of usual eutectic formers.

However, their biological performance has not yet been carefully scrutinized. Herein, THEDES based on the binary mixture of perillyl alcohol (POH) and ibuprofen (IBU) were prepared using different molar ratios. Our comprehensive strategy includes the characterization of their thermal and structural behavior to identify the molar ratios that successfully form deep eutectic systems. The in vitro solubility of the different systems prepared has demonstrated that, unlike other reported examples, the presence of the terpene did not affect the solubility of the anti-inflammatory agent in a physiological simulated media. The biological performance of the systems was studied in terms of their antimicrobial activity against a wide panel of microorganisms. The examined THEDES showed relevant antimicrobial activity against all tested microbial strains, with the exception of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. A synergistic effect from the combination of POH and IBU as a eutectic system was verified. Furthermore, the cytotoxic profile of these eutectic systems towards colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro cell models was also evaluated. The results provide the indication that the cell viability varies in a dose-dependent manner, with a selective THEDES action towards CRC cells. With tunable bioactivities in a ratio-dependent manner, THEDES enhanced the antimicrobial and anticancer properties, representing a possible alternative to conventional therapies.

To select safe excipients for nanoemulsion formulation and to discard any haemolytic potential, an in vitro miniaturized test was performed on human whole blood. From haemolysis results obtained on eighteen of the most commonly used excipients, a medium chain triglyceride, a surfactant, and a solubilizer were selected for formulation assays. Based on a design of experiments and a ternary diagram, the feasibility of nanoemulsions was determined. The composition was defined to produce monodisperse nanodroplets with a diameter of either 50 or 120 nm, and their physicochemical properties were optimized to be suitable for intravenous administration. These nanoemulsions, stable over 21 days in storage conditions, were shown to be able to encapsulate with high encapsulation efficiency and high drug loading, up to 16% (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), two water practically insoluble drug models: ibuprofen and fenofibrate.

The broth microdilution checkerboard assay revealed synergistic interactions between all investigated antipyretics, namely acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, with EEPs samples. The values of the fractional inhibitory concentration (ΣFIC) index for all these combinations were <0.5. While, in the case of considered antiseptics, namely chlorhexidine, octenidine dihydrochloride, and 2-phenoxyethanol, the positive interaction was confirmed only for the last one (values of ΣFIC in the range 0.0625-0.25). Combinations of two other agents with all four samples of EEPs resulted in an important antagonistic effect (values of ΣFIC ≥ 4.5). Propolis is mostly dedicated to the treatment of skin/wound infections; thus, these findings are of particular practical importance.

In vitro permeation, using human skin in Franz diffusion cells, showed increased permeation and similar cell viability in Df and HaCaT cell lines for SLN formulations when compared to commercial formulations of etofenamate (Reumon<sup>®</sup> Gel 5%) and ibuprofen (Ozonol<sup>®</sup> 5%). In vivo activity in the rat paw edema inflammation model showed that SLN hydrogels containing lower doses of etofenamate (8.3 times lower) and ibuprofen (16.6 times lower) produced similar effects compared to the commercial formulations, while decreasing edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, and causing no histological changes in the epidermis.

The main objective of this work is to assess if results from permeation, most of them at finite dose, may be equivalent to those from penetration usually at infinite dose. The transdermal behavior of four drugs with different physicochemical properties (diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, lidocaine, and caffeine) was studied using penetration/finite and kinetic permeation/infinite dose systems using vertical Franz diffusion cells to determine the relationships between permeation and penetration profiles. Good correlation of these two in vitro assays is difficult to find; the influence of their dosage and the proportion of different ionized/unionized compounds due to the pH of the skin layers was demonstrated. Finite and infinite dose regimens have different applications in transdermal delivery. Each approach presents its own advantages and challenges. Pharmaceutical industries are not always clear about the method and the dose to use to determine transdermal drug delivery. Being aware that this study presents results for four actives with different physicochemical properties, it can be concluded that the permeation/infinite results could not be always extrapolated to those of penetration/finite.

This might be because dependent lung areas cannot be reached by conventional aerosols. Due to their physicochemical properties, semifluorinated alkanes (SFAs) could address this problem. After induction of ARDS, 26 pigs were randomized into three groups: (1) control (Sham), (2) perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8), and (3) F6H8-ibuprofen.

However, to date, the role of excipients in these formulations on skin delivery of actives has received little attention from scientists in the field. Monitoring skin absorption of both drug and vehicle may provide insights into the mechanism by which excipients promote permeation and may facilitate the design of effective and safer products. Previously, we have investigated the use of quantitative Confocal Raman Spectroscopy (CRS) to investigate the delivery of an active to the skin, and we also reported the first fully quantitative study that compared this method with the well-established in vitro permeation test (IVPT) model. To further explore the potential of quantitative CRS in assessing topical delivery, the present work investigated the effects of commonly used excipients on the percutaneous absorption of a model drug, ibuprofen (IBU). Permeation of IBU and selected solvents following finite dose applications to human skin was determined in vitro and in vivo by Franz diffusion studies and quantitative CRS, respectively. The solvents used were propylene glycol (PG), dipropylene glycol (DPG), tripropylene glycol (TPG), and polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300). Overall, the cumulative amounts of IBU that permeated at 24 h in vitro were similar for PG, DPG, and TPG (<i>p</i> > 0.05). These three vehicles outperformed PEG 300 (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in terms of drug delivery. Concerning the vehicles, the rank order for in vitro skin permeation was DPG ≥ PG > TPG, while PEG 300 did not permeate the skin. A linear relationship between maximum vehicle and IBU flux in vitro was found, with a correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.95. When comparing in vitro with in vivo data, a positive in vitro-in vivo (IVIV) correlation between the cumulative permeation of IBU in vitro and the total amount of IBU that penetrated the stratum corneum (SC) in vivo was observed, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.90. A strong IVIV correlation, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82, was found following the linear regression of the cumulative number of solvents permeated in vitro and the corresponding skin uptake in vivo measured with CRS. This is the first study to correlate in vivo permeation of solvents measured by CRS with data obtained by in vitro diffusion studies. The IVIV correlations suggest that CRS is a powerful tool for profiling drug and vehicle delivery from dermal formulations. Future studies will examine additional excipients with varying physicochemical properties. Ultimately, these findings are expected to lead to new approaches for the design, evaluation, and optimization of formulations that target actives to and through the skin.",2021,,"Patel A, Iliopoulos F, Caspers PJ, Puppels GJ, Lane ME.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/4/542/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We designed 3D printed scaffold like drug carriers with varying pore sizes made from polylactic acid (PLA) using a fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printer. The 3D printed drug carriers were then loaded with Ibuprofen as a model drug, employing the controlled particle deposition (CPD) process from supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>. Carriers with varying pore sizes (0.027-0.125 mm) were constructed and loaded with Ibuprofen to yield drug-loaded carriers with a total amount of 0.83-2.67 mg API (0.32-1.41% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>). Dissolution studies of the carriers show a significantly decreasing dissolution rate with decreasing pore sizes with a mean dissolution time (MDT) of 8.7 min for the largest pore size and 128.2 min for the smallest pore size. The API dissolution mechanism from the carriers was determined to be Fickian diffusion from the non-soluble, non-swelling carriers. Using 3D printing in combination with the CPD process, we were able to develop dosage forms with individually tailored controlled drug release. The dissolution rate of our dosage forms can be easily adjusted to the individual needs by modifying the pore sizes of the 3D printed carriers.",2021,,"Schmid J, Wahl MA, Daniels R.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13040543,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To enhance the solubility of ibuprofen (IBU), a poorly water-soluble drug, we attempted to adsorb IBU onto spherical porous calcium silicate (Florite<sup>®</sup> PS300, PS300) in two ways: the evaporation (EV) and sealed heating (SH) methods. The crystallinity of the samples was evaluated using powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular interaction between IBU and PS300 was evaluated with FTIR. In addition, the dissolution behavior of IBU in the samples was assessed by the dissolution test. Based on the results of the PXRD and DSC measurements, both methods allowed adsorption of IBU onto PS300, and IBU was amorphized. Based on the FTIR observations, in the SH or EV mixtures containing 10% and 30% IBU, respectively, it seemed that the IBU molecules intermolecularly interacted with calcium molecules as the main component of PS300. Improvement in the solubility of IBU was observed with both methods; however, the dissolution rate of IBU from samples prepared via SH was higher than that from EV, or of IBU crystals. Collectively, our findings indicate that the petal-like structure of PS300, which has a spherical shape and good flowability, is an effective tool for adsorbing IBU onto PS300 via SH.",2021,,"Kawano Y, Chen S, Hanawa T.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/6/767/pdf?version=1621732440,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The objective of this study was to produce taste-masked ibuprofen granules using a novel process, twin-screw melt granulation (TSMG). TSMG is an emerging, high-productivity, continuous process. Granules of ibuprofen embedded in a lipid matrix were produced across a range of process conditions, resulting in a range of output granule particle sizes. The ibuprofen appeared to be miscible with the lipid binder though it recrystallized after processing. The ibuprofen melt granules were tested in simulated saliva using a novel, small-volume dissolution technique with continuous acquisition of the ibuprofen concentration. The ibuprofen release from the granules was slower than the neat API and physical blend, beyond the expected residence time of the granules in the mouth. The ibuprofen release was inversely related to the granule size. A Noyes-Whitney dissolution model was used and the resulting dissolution rate constants correlated well with the granule size.",2021,,"Forster SP, Lebo DB.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/6/863/pdf?version=1623653573,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

These drugs must overcome the skin barrier to cause a therapeutic effect. Human skin has been widely used as a model to study in vitro drug diffusion and permeation, however, it suffers from many limitations. Therefore, to perform in vitro permeation test (IVPT), we used a Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane with diffusion characteristics well-correlated to human skin. This study's objective was to optimize the IVPT conditions using Plackett-Burman experimental design for bio-predictive evaluation of the in vitro permeation rates of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, etofenamate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen) across Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane from commercial topical formulations. The Plackett-Burman factorial design was used to screen the effect of seven factors in eight runs with one additional center point. This tool allowed us to set the sensitive and discriminative IVPT final conditions that can appropriately characterize the NSAIDs formulations.

Ibuprofen, tofacitinib citrate, rhodamine B, and lidocaine were loaded into proposomes. These drug formulations were analyzed for particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, and in vitro skin permeation. The confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on skin treated with calcein and rhodamine B laden proposomes. The transdermal delivery relative to physicochemical properties of drugs such as logP, melting point, molecular weight, solubility, etc., were analyzed. We tested the safety of the proposomes using reconstructed human skin tissue equivalents, which were fabricated in-house. We also used human cadaver skin samples as a control. The proposomes had an average diameter of 128 to 148 nm. The drug's entrapment efficiencies were in the range of 42.9-52.7%, translating into the significant enhancement of drug permeation through the skin. The enhancement ratio was 1.4 to 4.0, and linearly correlated to logP, molecular weight, and melting point. Confocal imaging also showed higher skin permeation of calcein and rhodamine B in proposome than in solution. The proposome was found safe for skin application. The enhancement of skin delivery of drugs through proposomes was dependent on the lipophilicity of the drug. The entrapment efficiency was positively correlated with logP of the drug, which led to high drug absorption.",2021,,"Kathuria H, Handral HK, Cha S, Nguyen DTP, Cai J, Cao T, Wu C, Kang L.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/9/1457/pdf?version=1631520339,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, the sustained drug release achieved in prior studies largely relies on the presence of hydrophilic excipients in the printing formulation, which unfortunately impedes the printability and formability of the corresponding printing formulations. The current study developed and prepared mini-sized oral pellets using the SLA technique and successfully accomplished a hydrophilic excipient-independent drug release behavior. With ibuprofen as the model drug, the customized photopolymerizable printing formulation included polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) as a monomer and diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO) as a photoinitiator. The produced mini-sized pellets were thoroughly investigated for various factors, including their printability, physical properties, microscopic features, drug content, and drug-release profiles. The drug release profiles from the printed pellets that were larger size (3 mm and 6 mm) followed the Ritger-Peppas model, demonstrating that the release was influenced by both the diffusion of the dissolved drug and by the erosion of the hydrophilic excipients (PEG400). The profiles from the smaller printed pellets (1 mm and 2 mm) followed first release kinetics, not only illustrating that the release was impacted only by drug diffusion, but also indicating that there is a size boundary between the dependent and independent hydrophilic excipients. These results could create practical benefits to the pharmaceutical industry in terms of the design and development personalized dosages using the SLA printing technique with controllable drug release by manipulating size alone.",2021,,"Xu L, Yang Q, Qiang W, Li H, Zhong W, Pan S, Yang G.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/10/1717/pdf?version=1634791023,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In fact, their extremely high exposed surface area and pore volume allow to load and the release of several drugs, while their framework can be enriched with specific therapeutic ions allowing to boost the tissue regeneration. However, due to the open and easily accessible mesopore structure of MBG, the release of the incorporated therapeutic molecules shows an initial burst effect leading to unsuitable release kinetics. Hence, a still open challenge in the design of drug delivery systems based on MBGs is the control of their release behavior. In this work, Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of polyelectrolyte multi-layers was exploited as a powerful and versatile technique for coating the surface of Cu-substituted MBG nanoparticles with innovative multifunctional drug delivery systems for co-releasing of therapeutic copper ions (exerting pro-angiogenic and anti-bacterial effects) and an anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen). Two different routes were investigated: in the first strategy, chitosan and alginate were assembled by forming the multi-layered surface, and, successively, ibuprofen was loaded by incipient wetness impregnation, while in the second approach, alginate was replaced by ibuprofen, introduced as polyelectrolyte layer. Zeta-potential, TGA and FT-IR spectroscopy were measured after the addition of each polyelectrolyte layer, confirming the occurrence of the stepwise deposition. In addition, the in vitro bioactivity and the ability to modulate the release of the cargo were evaluated. The polyelectrolyte coated-MBGs were proved to retain the peculiar ability to induce hydroxyapatite formation after 7 days of soaking in Simulated Body Fluid. Both copper ions and ibuprofen were co-released over time, showing a sustained release profile up to 14 days and 24 h, respectively, with a significantly lower burst release compared to the bare MBG particles.",2021,,"Pontremoli C, Pagani M, Maddalena L, Carosio F, Vitale-Brovarone C, Fiorilli S.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13111952,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, most of these drugs display low water solubility, which makes their incorporation into hydrophilic biopolymeric drug-delivery systems difficult. To overcome this drawback, aqueous solutions of bio-based deep eutectic solvents (DES) were investigated to enhance the solubility of ibuprofen, a widely used NSAID, leading to an increase in its solubility of up to 7917-fold when compared to its water solubility. These DES solutions were shown to be non-toxic to macrophages with cell viabilities of 97.4% (at ibuprofen concentrations of 0.25 mM), while preserving the anti-inflammatory action of the drug. Their incorporation into alginate-based hydrogels resulted in materials with a regular structure and higher flexibility. These hydrogels present a sustained release of the drug, which is able, when containing the DES aqueous solution comprising ibuprofen, to deliver 93.5% of the drug after 8 h in PBS. Furthermore, these hydrogels were able to improve the drug permeation across human skin by 8.5-fold in comparison with the hydrogel counterpart containing only ibuprofen.

Ibuprofen (IBU)-poloxamer 407 (P407) eutectic effervescent tablets were fabricated with a direct compression method.

In addition, the dissolution rate (k) and disintegration time of eutectic effervescent tablets in 0.1 N HCl buffer pH 1.2 were also determined. Incorporation of P407 into the IBU tablet improved the tablet wetting properties with increasing liquid penetration distance under stereoscope. CO<sub>2</sub> liberation from effervescent agents promoted tablet surface roughness from matrix erosion. The relationship between observed physical properties and disintegration and dissolution parameters suggested that the combination of erosion by effervescent agents and gel formation by P407 had a potential influence on dissolution enhancement of the formulation.

This includes balancing the benefits and risks not only of single drugs but often requires complex between-drug comparisons. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been available for several decades and their use is described in an abundance of guidelines. Most of these guidelines recommend that 'the selection of a particular NSAID should be based on the benefit-risk balance for each patient'. However, head-to-head studies are often lacking or of poor quality, reflecting the lower standards for clinical research and regulatory approval at the time. The inconsistency of approved indications between countries due to national applications adds to the complexity. Finally, a fading research interest once drugs become generic points to a general deficit in the post-marketing evaluation of medicines. Far from claiming completeness, this narrative review aimed to illustrate the challenges that physicians encounter when trying to balance benefits and risks in a situation of incomplete and inconsistent data on longstanding treatment concepts.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been utilised to enhance the nanogels' loading ability towards poorly soluble drugs and promote/sustain drug release. However, formation of CD-based nanogels requires the use of specially modified CDs, or of crosslinking agents. The aim of this work was to develop a CD-based nanogel to improve the cutaneous delivery of ibuprofen by using the soluble β-cyclodextrin/epichlorohydrin polymer (EPIβCD) without adding any potentially toxic crosslinker. The use of EPIβCD enabled increasing ibuprofen loading due to its complexing/solubilizing power towards the poorly soluble drug and prolonging drug release over time due to the nanogel formation. DLS analysis proved that EPIβCD allowed the formation of nanostructures ranging from 60 up to 400 nm, depending on the gelling agent type and the gel preparation method. EPIβCD replacement with monomeric HPβCD did not lead in any case to nanogel formation. Permeation experiments using skin-simulating artificial membranes proved that the EPIβCD-based nanogel enhanced ibuprofen solubility and release, increasing its permeation rate up to 3.5 times, compared to a reference formulation without CD and to some commercial gel formulations, and also assured a sustained release.

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs), and minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) of CIP, GEN, FEP, IPM, and MEM with/without sub-MICs of IBP (200 µg/mL), ASA (200 µg/mL), and DXP (500 µg/mL) for the clinical isolates were determined by the microbroth dilution method. Quantitative real-time-PCR (qPCR) was used to determine the expression levels of biofilm-related genes, including <i>icaA</i> in <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>algD</i> in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> at sub-MICs of IBP, ASA, and DXP. All <i>S. aureus</i> isolates were methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA), and all <i>P. aeruginosa</i> were resistant to carbapenems. IBP decreased the levels of MIC, MBIC, and MBEC for all antibiotic agents in both clinical isolates, except for FEP among <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates.

In a previous work, we have shown that Weblike film forming systems (also called Pouches Drug Delivery Systems, PDDS) enable enhanced skin delivery of the incorporated molecules. These delivery systems are composed of one or more phospholipids, a short-chain alcohol, a polymer and optionally water. In this work, we continue the investigation and characterization of Weblike carriers focusing on some factors affecting the delivery properties such as components concentration and mode of application on the skin. Upon non-occluded application on the skin, the systems dry rapidly, forming a web-like structured film. Lidocaine, Ibuprofen, FITC and Cannabidiol are molecules with various physico-chemical properties that were incorporated in the carrier. The systems were tested in a number of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results of the in vitro permeation of Ibuprofen through porcine skin indicated two-fold delivery through the skin of Ibuprofen when applied from our Weblike system in comparison with a nanovesicular carrier, the ethosome.

All materials were characterized by various analytical techniques and applied as a platform for delivery of selected drug molecules. On the basis of X-ray diffraction (presence of reflections in the 2θ angle range of 1.5-2.5°) and low-temperature nitrogen sorption isotherms (mixture of isotherms of I and IV type) additional secondary porosity was found in the mesopore range. Additional tests were also conducted to determine the possibility of loading selected molecules with biological activity into the aforementioned materials and then releasing them in the therapeutic process. Molecules with different therapeutic options were selected for testing, namely ibuprofen, curcumin, and ferulic acid with anti-inflammatory, potentially anticancer, antioxidant, and skin discoloration activities, respectively. Preliminary studies have confirmed the possibility of using hierarchical zeolites as potential carriers for bioactive molecules, as the loading percentage of active substances ranged from 39-79% and cumulative release for ibuprofen reached almost 100% after 8 h of testing.",2023,,"Wawrzyńczak A, Nowak I, Woźniak N, Chudzińska J, Feliczak-Guzik A.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/15/2/535/pdf?version=1676611352,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Ibuprofen (IBU), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, slows the progression of disease without causing significant side effects. Considering the poor water-solubility of the drug, IBU nanoparticles are beneficial for local pulmonary administration. We aimed to formulate a carrier-free dry powder inhaler containing nanosized IBU. We combined high-performance ultra-sonication and nano spray-drying. IBU was dissolved in ethyl acetate; after that, it was sonicated into a polyvinyl alcohol solution, where it precipitated as nanoparticles. Mannitol and leucine were added when producing dry particles using nano-spray drying. The following investigations were implemented: dynamic light scattering, laser diffraction, surface tension measurement, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, in vitro dissolution test, and in vitro aerodynamic assessment (Andersen Cascade Impactor). The particle diameter of the IBU was in the nano range. The spray-dried particles showed a spherical morphology. The drug release was rapid in artificial lung media. The products represented large fine particle fractions and proper aerodynamic diameters. We successfully created an inhalable powder, containing nano-sized IBU. Along with the exceptional aerodynamic performance, the ideal particle size, shape, and drug-release profile might offer a ground-breaking local therapy for CF.",2023,,"Party P, Klement ML, Szabó-Révész P, Ambrus R.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/15/2/545/pdf?version=1676624088,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Drug formulation developers were initially intrigued by its surfactant qualities, and gradually it made its way into the toolkit of pharmaceutical drug delivery. Since then, four drugs with TPGS in their formulation have been approved for sale in the United States and Europe including ibuprofen, tipranavir, amprenavir, and tocophersolan. Improvement and implementation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for disease are goals of nanomedicine and the succeeding field of nanotheranostics. Specifically, imaging and treating tumors with nanohybrid theranostics shows promising potential. Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin are examples of poorly bioavailable therapeutic agents; hence, much effort is applied for developing TPGS-based nanomedicine, nanotheranostics, and targeted drug delivery systems to increase circulation time and promote the reticular endothelial escape of these drug delivery systems. TPGS has been used in a number of ways for improving drug solubility, bioavailability improvement, and prevention of drug efflux from the targeted cells, which makes it an excellent candidate for therapeutic delivery. Through the downregulation of P-gp expression and modulation of efflux pump activity, TPGS can also mitigate multidrug resistance (MDR). Novel materials such as TPGS-based copolymers are being studied for their potential use in various diseases. In recent clinical trials, TPGS has been utilized in a huge number of Phase I, II, and III studies. Additionally, numerous TPGS-based nanomedicine and nanotheranostic applications are reported in the literature which are in their preclinical stage. However, various randomized or human clinical trials have been underway for TPGS-based drug delivery systems for multiple diseases such as pneumonia, malaria, ocular disease, keratoconus, etc. In this review, we have emphasized in detail the review of the nanotheranostics and targeted drug delivery approaches premised on TPGS.

As the bioavailability enhancement of poorly soluble drugs requires a thorough understanding of the desired formulation, the appropriate in vitro modelling of the absorption mechanism is essential. Four immediate release ibuprofen 200 mg formulations were tested in the GIS using fasted biorelevant media. In addition to the free acid form, ibuprofen was present as sodium and lysine salts in tablets and as a solution in soft-gelatin capsules. In the case of rapid-dissolving formulations, the dissolution results indicated supersaturation in the gastric compartment, which affected the resulting concentrations in the duodenum and the jejunum as well. In addition, a Level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) model was established using published in vivo data, and then the plasma concentration profiles of each formulation were simulated. The predicted pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with the statistical output of the published clinical study.

Currently, BE is demonstrated by comparative clinical endpoint studies; these are costly and time-consuming and often lack sensitivity and reproducibility. Previously, we reported excellent correlations between in vivo Confocal Raman Spectroscopy in human subjects and in vitro skin permeation testing (IVPT) with the human epidermis for skin delivery of ibuprofen and a number of excipients. The aim of the present proof-of-concept study was to evaluate CRS as a method to assess BE of topical products. Two commercially available formulations, Nurofen Max Strength 10% Gel and Ibuleve Speed Relief Max Strength 10% Gel, were selected for evaluation. Delivery of ibuprofen (IBU) to the skin was determined in vitro and in vivo by IVPT and CRS, respectively. The formulations examined were found to deliver comparable amounts of IBU across the skin over 24 h in vitro (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Additionally, the formulations resulted in similar skin uptake values measured with CRS in vivo, either at 1 h or 2 h after application (<i>p</i> > 0.05).

Quality-by-design strategies, such as Box-Behnken factorial design (BBD), are in line with the current need to use sustainable processes to develop new formulations. Thus, this work aimed at optimizing the physicochemical properties of transfersomes for cutaneous applications, by applying a BBD strategy to incorporate mixed edge activators with opposing hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB). Tween<sup>®</sup> 80 and Span<sup>®</sup> 80 were used as edge activators and ibuprofen sodium salt (IBU) was selected as the model drug. After the initial screening of the IBU solubility in aqueous media, a BBD protocol was implemented, and the optimized formulation displayed appropriate physicochemical properties for skin delivery. By comparing the optimized transfersomes to equivalent liposomes, the incorporation of mixed edge activators was found to be beneficial to upgrade the storage stability of the nanosystems.

Designing topical formulations with maximum drug efficiency requires the optimization of the permeation and the stability of the drug. The present study focuses on the physical stability of amorphous drugs within the formulation. Ibuprofen is commonly used in topical formulations and then was selected as a model drug. Additionally, its low Tg allows easy, unexpected recrystallization at room temperature with negative consequence on skin penetration. In this study, the physical stability of amorphous ibuprofen was investigated in two types of formulations: (i) in terpenes-based deep eutectic solvents (DES) and (ii) in arginine-based co-amorphous blends. The phase diagram of ibuprofen:L-menthol was mainly analyzed by low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, leading to the evidence of ibuprofen recrystallization in a wide range of ibuprofen concentration. By contrast, it was shown that amorphous ibuprofen is stabilized when dissolved in thymol:menthol DES. Forming co-amorphous arginine-ibuprofen blends by melting is another route for stabilizing amorphous ibuprofen, while recrystallization was detected in the same co-amorphous mixtures obtained by cryo-milling. The mechanism of stabilization is discussed from determining T<sub>g</sub> and analyzing H-bonding interactions by Raman investigations in the C=O and O-H stretching regions. It was found that recrystallization of ibuprofen was inhibited by the inability to form dimers inherent to the preferential formation of heteromolecular H-bonding, regardless of the glass transition temperatures of the various mixtures. This result should be important for predicting ibuprofen stability within other types of topical formulations.",2023,,"Guinet Y, Paccou L, Hédoux A.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15061710,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study evaluated solvent-free hot-melt extrusion (HME) for forming cyclodextrin inclusion complexes to improve the solubility and dissolution of ibuprofen (IBU). Molecular docking confirmed IBU's hosting in Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβ-CD), while phase solubility revealed its complex stoichiometry and stability. In addition, an 11 mm twin-screw co-rotating extruder with PVP VA-64 as an auxiliary substance aided the complex formation and extrusion. Using QbD and the Box-Behnken design, we studied variables (barrel temperature, screw speed, and polymer concentration) and their impact on solubility and dissolution. The high polymer concentration and high screw speeds positively affected the dependent variables. However, higher temperatures had a negative effect. The lowest barrel temperature set near the Tg of the polymer, when combined with high polymer concentrations, resulted in high torques in HME and halted the extrusion process. Therefore, the temperature and polymer concentration should be selected to provide sufficient melt viscosities to aid the complex formation and extrusion process. Studies such as DSC and XRD revealed the amorphous conversion of IBU, while the inclusion complex formation was demonstrated by ATR and NMR studies. The dissolution of ternary inclusion complexes (TIC) produced from HME was found to be ≥85% released within 30 min. This finding implied the high solubility of IBU, according to the US FDA 2018 guidance for highly soluble compounds containing immediate-release solid oral dosage forms.

The bacterial infections that occur in burn wounds might be treated using different topically applied materials, but bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a major problem worldwide. Therefore, the use of non-antibiotic treatments represents a major interest in current research. In this study, new antibiocomposite hydrogels with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties based on hyaluronic acid (HA) and sodium alginate (AG) were obtained using 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazinyl-2)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride as an activator. The combination of Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to reduce inflammation, fever and pain in the body, with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was used in this study aimed at creating a complex hydrogel with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial action and capable of improving the healing process of wounds caused by burns. FTIR spectra confirmed the cross-linking of AG with HA as well as the successful incorporation of ZnO NPs. Using electronic microscopy, it was noticed that the morphology of hydrogels is influenced by the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles. Moreover, the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles into hydrogels also has an influence on the swelling behavior at both pH 7.4 and 5.4. In fact, the swelling rate is lower when the amounts of the activator, HA and ZnO NPs are high. A drug release rate of almost 100% was observed for hydrogels without ZnO NPs, whereas the addition of nanoparticles to hydrogels led to a decrease in the release rate to 68% during 24 h. Cellular viability tests demonstrated the non-cytotoxic behavior of the hydrogels without the ZnO NPs, whereas a weak to moderate cytotoxic effect was noticed for hydrogels with ZnO NPs. The hydrogels containing 4% and 5% ZnO NPs, respectively, showed good antimicrobial activity against the <i>S. aureus</i> strain.

The investigation begins by exploring the physical properties and gel formation behaviour of the ISGs, with a particular focus on determining their sustained release capabilities. To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions and dynamics within the ISGs, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations are employed. The effects of adding IBU and DH on reducing surface tension and water tolerance properties, thus affecting molecular properties. The phase transformation phenomenon is observed around the interface, where droplets of ISGs move out to the water phase, leading to the precipitation of IBU around the interface. The optimization of drug release profiles ensures sustained local drug release over seven days, with a burst release observed on the first day. Interestingly, different organic solvents show varying abilities to control DH release, with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) demonstrating superior control compared to <i>N</i>-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). MD simulations using AMBER20 software provide valuable insights into the movement of individual molecules, as evidenced by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values. The addition of IBU to the system results in the retardation of IBU molecule movement, particularly evident in the DMSO series, with the diffusion constant value of DH reducing from 1.2452 to 0.3372 and in the NMP series from 0.3703 to 0.2245 after adding IBU. The RMSD values indicate a reduction in molecule fluctuation of DH, especially in the DMSO system, where it decreases from over 140 to 40 Å. Moreover, their radius of gyration is influenced by IBU, with the DMSO system showing lower values, suggesting an increase in molecular compactness. Notably, the DH-IBU configuration exhibits stable pairing through H-bonding, with a higher amount of H-bonding observed in the DMSO system, which is correlated with the drug retardation efficacy.

A systemic delivery, such as a buccal delivery, of NSAIDs would be beneficial and additionally has the advantage of a non-invasive administration route, especially favourable for children or the elderly. To investigate the transport of NSAIDs across the buccal mucosa and determine their potential for buccal therapeutic usage, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and piroxicam were tested using an established oral mucosa Transwell<sup>®</sup> model based on human cell line TR146. Carboxyfluorescein and diazepam were applied as internal paracellular and transcellular marker molecule, respectively. Calculated permeability coefficients revealed a transport ranking of ibuprofen > piroxicam > diclofenac > celecoxib. Transporter protein inhibitor verapamil increased the permeability for ibuprofen, piroxicam and celecoxib, whereas probenecid increased the permeability for all tested NSAIDs. Furthermore, influence of local inflammation of the buccal mucosa on the transport of NSAIDs was mimicked by treating cells with a cytokine mixture of TNF-α, IL-1ß and IFN-γ followed by transport studies with ibuprofen (+ probenecid). Cellular response to pro-inflammatory stimuli was confirmed by upregulation of cytokine targets at the mRNA level, increased secreted cytokine levels and a significant decrease in the paracellular barrier. Permeability of ibuprofen was increased across cell layers treated with cytokines, while addition of probenecid increased permeability of ibuprofen in controls, but not across cell layers treated with cytokines. In summary, the suitability of the in vitro oral mucosa model to measure NSAID transport rankings was demonstrated, and the involvement of transporter proteins was confirmed; an inflammation model was established, and increased NSAID transport upon inflammation was measured.",2024,,"Lin GC, Friedl HP, Grabner S, Gerhartl A, Neuhaus W.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040543,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

To tackle this issue, we built a model with four different types of primary liver cells: hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. We cultured them in different combinations of composition and volumes of cell medium, hepatocyte proportions of total cells and additions of extracellular matrixes. We added rifampicin (RIF), ibuprofen (IBU) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to this model and observed the microanatomy and physiology changes for a week with preclinical and clinical instruments. Among the different model configurations, we selected the feature combination of the in vitro model that had similar biomarker values to those measured in clinical diagnostics. When we exposed the selected model configuration to RIF, IBU and 5-FU, we observed similar glucose, triglyceride and albumin dynamics as in vivo (from clinical data). Therefore, we have built an in vitro liver model that resembles the liver microenvironment, and we have analysed it with clinical instrumentation to facilitate data translation.

The optimal formulation consisted of 10% Triacetin, 80% Gelucire 48/16, and 10% Tetraethylene glycol. SSE 3D printing was employed to create three different-sized suppositories with varying drug contents. These suppositories were assessed for their physicochemical properties, content uniformity, and dissolution profiles. <b>Results</b>: The prepared mixture exhibited suitable physical properties for printing, with nano-sized emulsion droplets providing a large surface area for improved drug absorption in the rectum. Characterization techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that IBU was present in the formulation in an amorphous state.

We aimed to use the freeze-drying method to create a novel approach for preparing CD-MOFs. MOFs consisting of γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) and potassium cations (K<sup>+</sup>) were employed to encapsulate the poorly water-soluble model drug Ibuprofen (IBU) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF).<h4>Methods</h4>Using the LeanQbD<sup>®</sup> software (v2022), we designed the experiments based on the Quality by Design (QbD) concept. According to QbD, we identified the three most critical factors, which were the molar ratio of the IBU to the γCD, incubation time, and the percentage of the organic solvent. light-, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and laser diffraction were utilized to observe the morphology and particle size of the samples. In addition, the products were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).<h4>Results</h4>Based on characterizations, we concluded that a γCD-MOF/IBU complex was also formed using the freeze-drying method.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (IBU) and the mucolytic mannitol (MAN) can treat these symptoms. Compared to per os administration, a lower dose of these drugs is sufficient to achieve the desired effect by delivering them in a pulmonary manner. However, it is still a challenge to administer high drug doses to the lungs. We aim to develop two inhaled powder formulations, a single-drug product of MAN and a combined formulation containing IBU and MAN. <b>Methods:</b> MAN was dissolved in an aqueous solution of Poloxamer-188 (POL). In the case of the combined formulation, a suspension was first prepared in a planetary mill via wet milling in POL medium. After the addition of leucine (LEU), the formulations were spray-dried. The prepared DPI samples were analyzed by using laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, density tests, in vitro aerodynamic studies (Andersen Cascade Impactor, Spraytec<sup>®</sup> device), in vitro dissolution tests in artificial lung fluid, and in silico tests with stochastic lung model. <b>Results:</b> The DPIs showed suitability for inhalation with low-density spherical particles of appropriate size.

In the present work, we investigate if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug substances (NSAIDs) interact with substrate transport via human (h)PAT1. <b>Methods</b>: The transport of substrates via hPAT1 was investigated in Caco-2 cells using radiolabeled substrate uptake and in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes injected with <i>hPAT1 cRNA</i>, measuring induced currents using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The molecular interaction between NSAIDs and hPAT1 was investigated using an AlphaFold2 model and molecular docking. <b>Results:</b> NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, and flurbiprofen inhibited proline uptake via hPAT1, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 954 (logIC<sub>50</sub> 2.98 ± 0.1) µM, 272 (logIC<sub>50</sub> 2.43 ± 0.1) µM, and 280 (logIC<sub>50</sub> 2.45 ± 0.1) µM, respectively. Ibuprofen acted as a non-competitive inhibitor of hPAT1-mediated proline transport. In hPAT1-expressing oocytes, ibuprofen and diclofenac did not induce inward currents, and inhibited inward currents caused by proline. Molecular modeling pointed to a binding mode involving an allosteric site. <b>Conclusions:</b> NSAIDs interact with hPAT1 as non-translocated non-competitive inhibitors, and molecular modeling points to a binding mode involving an allosteric site distinct from the substrate binding site.

However, the relationships between the coated-copolymer encapsulation and drug delivery performance in the hybrid nanocomposites was rarely reported. Therefore, the main objectives of the present work are to explore the cell uptake, cellular internalization, cytotoxicity, and hemolysis performance of the fluorescent hybrid materials with different polymer-encapsulated amounts. <b>Methods:</b> Using (2-(2-aminoethyl)-6-(dimethylamino)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione)-doped poly[(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-(acrylic acid)] (PAN) as a shell and bimodal mesoporous silicas (BMMs) as a core, the dual pH- and temperature-responsive mesoporous PAN@M-BMMs with the fluorescent performances were synthesized via a radical polymerization approach. The effects of the PAN-coated thicknesses on their physicochemical properties and structural features were demonstrated via XRD and SAXS patterns, SEM and TEM images, FT-IR spectra, and TG analysis. Their mass fractal (<i>D<sub>m</sub></i>) evolutions were elucidated on the basis of the SAXS patterns and fluorescence spectra. <b>Results:</b> The <i>D<sub>m</sub></i> values increased from 2.74 to 2.87 with an increase of the PAN-coated amount from 17 to 26.5% along with the particle size from 76.1 to 85.6 nm and blue-shifting of their fluorescent emission wavelength from 470 to 444 nm. Meanwhile, the PAN@M-BMMs exhibited a high ibuprofen (IBU) loading capacity (13.8%) and strong dual pH-/temperature-responsive drug-releasing performances (83.1%) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C, as comparison with that (17.9%) at pH 2.0 and 37 °C. The simulated results confirmed that the adsorption energy decreased from -67.18 kJ/mol for pure BMMs to -116.76 kJ/mol for PAN@M-BMMs, indicating the PAN-grafting on the surfaces of the BMMs core was beneficial to improve its IBU-adsorption capacity. Its uptake in the HeLa cell line was performed via microplate readers, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and ICP measurement, showing a low cytotoxicity at a concentration up to 100 µg/mL. Specially, P<sub>0.2</sub>AN@M-BMMs had a superior cellular uptake and fluorescence properties via the time-dependent uptake experiments, and exhibited the highest silicon content via the cellular internalization analysis, as compared to other carriers.

Recent regulatory authority guidelines emphasise a systematic, risk-based approach to evaluating these interactions, underscoring the need for mechanistic insight. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), modulate cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, reducing the metabolism of CYP substrates. Cytokine antagonists (such as IL-6 receptor antagonists) can counteract this effect, restoring CYP activity and increasing drug clearance. However, quantitative prediction of cytokine-mediated drug interactions remains challenging, as existing models often lack the mechanistic detail needed to capture the dynamic relationship between cytokine signalling, receptor engagement, and downstream modulation of drug metabolism. <b>Methods:</b> A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework incorporating cytokine-receptor binding, subsequent downregulation of CYP expression, and blockade of the cytokine signalling by a therapeutic protein antagonist was developed to simulate and investigate cytokine antagonist-drug interactions. Tocilizumab, a humanised IL-6 receptor antagonist used to treat several inflammatory conditions associated with elevated IL-6 levels, was selected as a model drug to demonstrate the utility of the framework. <b>Results:</b> The developed PBPK model accurately predicted the pharmacokinetics profiles of tocilizumab and captured clinically observed dynamic changes in simvastatin exposure before and after tocilizumab treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Simulated IL-6 dynamics aligned with observed clinical profiles, showing transient elevation following receptor blockade and associated restoration of CYP3A4 activity. Prospective simulations with commonly co-administered CYP substrates (celecoxib, chloroquine, cyclosporine, ibuprofen, prednisone, simvastatin, and theophylline) in RA patients revealed dose regimen- and drug-dependent differences in interaction magnitude. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrated the utility of PBPK models in providing a mechanistic understanding of cytokine antagonist-drug interactions, supporting enhanced therapeutic decision-making and optimising patient care in inflammatory conditions.",2025,,"Pan X, Liu C, Stader F, Derbalah A, Jamei M, Gardner I.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics17070896,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

For example, hydrophilic and hydrophobic PSi microparticles have been utilized to improve the dissolution rate of poorly soluble drugs and to sustain peptide delivery. Previously, the well-plate method has been demonstrated to be a suitable in vitro dissolution method for hydrophilic PSi particles but it was not applicable to poorly wetting hydrophobic thermally hydrocarbonized PSi (THCPSi) particles. In this work, three different in vitro dissolution techniques, namely centrifuge, USP Apparatus 1 (basket) and well-plate methods were compared by using hydrophilic thermally carbonized PSi (TCPSi) microparticles loaded with poorly soluble ibuprofen or freely soluble antipyrine. All the methods showed a fast and complete or nearly complete release of both model compounds from the TCPSi microparticles indicating that all methods described in vitro dissolution equally. Based on these results, the centrifuge method was chosen to study the release of a peptide (ghrelin antagonist) from the THCPSi microparticles since it requires small sample amounts and achieves good particle suspendability. Sustained peptide release from the THCPSi microparticles was observed, which is in agreement with an earlier in vivo study.

This narrative review aims to provide an up-to-date evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and clinical use of intravenous (IV) NSAIDs for perioperative pain management in adults and children. The NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) approved in Europe for the short-term symptomatic treatment of acute, moderate perioperative pain via IV infusion in adults and/or children have been influenced by US and global guidelines and practice: the drugs primarily reviewed here are ibuprofen, ketorolac, ketoprofen, naproxen, paracetamol, and acetylsalicylic acid. Furthermore, intravenous ibuprofen is authorized for the short-term symptomatic treatment of fever. In contrast to intravenous ketoprofen, intravenous ibuprofen is authorized for administration to children over 6 years of age or weighing more than 20 kg. Overall, IV ibuprofen had a more favorable profile with regard to peri- and postoperative opioid sparing and pain relief. Oral ibuprofen and IV ibuprofen have similar levels of efficacy, although IV ibuprofen has a shorter onset of action and is required in patients who are unable to take oral medications. The frequency of significant adverse events appears to be similar for ibuprofen and paracetamol. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses report that intravenous NSAIDs reduce postoperative opioid consumption by approximately 20-60%, improving pain management with fewer opioid-related side effects.

Four different materials were synthesized using succinic anhydride (CsSUC), maleic anhydride (CsMAL), itaconic acid (CsITA), and <i>trans</i>-aconitic acid (CsTACON) as grafting agents. After synthesis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed before and after DCF adsorption. In addition, a complete adsorption evaluation was carried out for all materials studying some important parameters. The optimum pH was 4; the amino groups of DCF can be protonated at pH = 4 (⁻NH⁺), so this groups can easily attract the clear negatively carboxyl moieties (⁻COO<sup>-</sup>) of the chitosan adsorbents. The <i>Q</i><sub>m</sub> for CsTACON was higher than those of the other materials, at all temperatures studied. By altering the temperature from 25 to 35 °C, an increase (16%) of <i>Q</i><sub>m</sub> (from 84.56 to 98.34 mg g<sup>-1</sup>) was noted, while similar behavior was revealed after a further increase of temperature from 35 to 45 °C, improving by 5% (from 98.34 to 102.75 mg g<sup>-1</sup>). All isotherms were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F) models). In addition, a kinetic model was proposed taking into account not only the interactions but also the diffusivity of the molecule (DCF) into the polymeric network. The behavior of the prepared chitosan materials in simultaneously removing other compounds (synergetic or antagonistic) was also evaluated by experiments performed in mixtures. DCF presented the highest removal from the mixture in the order: CsTACON (92.8%) > CsITA (89.5%) > CsSUC (80.9%) > CsMAL (66.2%) compared to other pharmaceutical compounds (salicylic acid, ibuprofen and ketoprofen). Desorption was achieved by using different eluants (either water or organic). The highest desorption ability was found for acetone (100% for CsTACON, CsSUC, CsMAL and 77% for CsITA) for all materials.",2019,,"Tzereme A, Christodoulou E, Kyzas GZ, Kostoglou M, Bikiaris DN, Lambropoulou DA.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/11/3/497/pdf?version=1552556357,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this context, multifunctional hydrogels have been obtained from chemically modified chitosan and acrylic polymers as cross-linkers, followed by subsequent conjugation with arginine. The hydrogels were finely tuned considering the variation of the synthetic monomer and the preparation conditions. The advantage of using both natural and synthetic polymers allowed porous networks with superabsorbent behavior, associated with a non-Fickian swelling mechanism. The in vitro release profiles for ibuprofen and the corresponding kinetics were studied, and the results revealed a swelling-controlled release.

In this study, GO membranes were prepared through filtration by a pressure-assisted self-assembly method involving the cross-linking of three diamine monomers on a polyethersulfone (PES) support. The different small molecular diamines, ethylenediamine, butanediamine, and p-phenylenediamine, were introduced as cross-linking agents to investigate the effect of diamine on the properties of GO membranes. The hydrophobic substances ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and triclosan were selected as target pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The adsorption and molecular sieving activities of PPCPs by cross-linked GO membranes at a pH of 3 were investigated. The permeate water was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm, molecular weight distribution, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. The results showed that the removal of hydrophobic PPCPs by GO membranes was mainly due to their adsorption and molecular sieving activities. Adsorption was mainly determined by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the membranes and PPCPs. The interception effect was mainly determined by the interlayer spacing between the GO membranes and the molecular weight and steric hindrance of the PPCPs. A smaller spacing of the GO membrane layers resulted in greater steric hindrance and a higher removal rate.",2020,,"Lou Y, Tan FJ, Zeng R, Wang M, Li P, Xia S.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/9/1921/pdf?version=1598524583,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

They can also be used as a drug carrier for local delivery, and are able to activate immune cells to enhance wound healing. Here, we developed heparin-conjugated poly(<i>N</i>-isopropylacrylamide), an injectable, in situ gel-forming polymer, and evaluated its use in wound healing. Ibuprofen was encapsulated into the hydrogel to help reduce pain and excessive inflammation during healing. In addition to in vitro studies, a BALB/c mice model was used to evaluate its effect on would healing and the secretion of inflammatory mediators. The in vitro assay confirmed that the ibuprofen released from the hydrogel dramatically reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by suppressing the production of NO, PGE2 and TNF-α in RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, an in vivo wound healing assay was conducted by applying hydrogels to wounds on the backs of mice.

Biodegradable coatings based on poly(lactic acid-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid), PLGA, represent versatile and safe candidates for surface modification of implantable biomaterials and devices, providing additional tunable ability for topical delivery of desired therapeutic agents. In the present study, Ibuprofen-loaded PLGA coatings (PLGA/IBUP) were obtained by using the dip-coating and drop-casting combined protocol. The composite materials demonstrated long-term drug release under biologically simulated dynamic conditions. Reversible swelling phenomena of polymeric coatings occurred in the first two weeks of testing, accompanied by the gradual matrix degradation and slow release of the therapeutic agent. Irreversible degradation of PLGA coatings occurred after one month, due to copolymer's hydrolysis (evidenced by chemical and structural modifications). After 30 days of dynamic testing, the cumulative release of IBUP was ~250 µg/mL. Excellent cytocompatibility was revealed on human-derived macrophages, fibroblasts and keratinocytes.

Coated and non-coated CANF formulations were characterized by several microscopic and spectroscopic techniques to evaluate their physicochemical properties. An analysis of the kinetic release profile of Ib showed noticeable differences due to the presence or absence of the poly-AAm hydrogel polymer. Poly-AAm coating facilitated a constant release rate of drug as opposed to a more conventional burst release. The non-coated CANFs showed low cumulative drug release concentrations (ca. 35 and 83% at 5 and 10% loading, respectively).

The composite aerogel consists of two types of cross-linked nanofibrils. Poly(dopamine)-coated cellulose nanofibrils and amyloid protein nanofibrils are forming a double networked crosslinked via periodate oxidation. The resulting aerogel exhibits good mechanical strength and high pollutants adsorption capability. Removal of dyes (rhodamine blue, acriflavine, crystal violet, malachite green, acid fuchsin and methyl orange), organic traces (atrazine, bisphenol A, and ibuprofen) and heavy metal ions (Pb(II) and Cu(II)) from water was successfully demonstrated with the composite aerogel. More specifically, the bio-based aerogel demonstrated good adsorption efficiencies for crystal violet (93.1% in 30 min), bisphenol A (91.7% in 5 min) and Pb(II) ions (94.7% in 5 min), respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption-desorption performance of aerogel for Pb(II) ions demonstrates that the aerogel has a high reusability as maintains satisfactory removal performances.

The fabrication process involved the use of 3D printing and coaxial electrospinning technologies. Specifically, we utilized a lab-developed solution-extrusion 3D printer to fabricate polycaprolactone (PCL) meshes. Then, bi-layered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanofibrous membranes, which embedded ibuprofen and epidermal growth factor (EGF), were prepared utilizing electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning techniques, respectively.

In this study, blend fibers of polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) at various compositions were electrospun from 10 wt% of polymer solutions to encapsulate a model drug of ibuprofen (IBP). The results showed that the average polymer solution viscosities determined the electrospinning parameters and the resulting average fiber diameters. Increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers decreased the average elastic moduli, the average tensile strength, and the average fracture strains, where IBP exhibited a plasticizing effect in the blend PCL/PEO fibers. Increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers promoted the surface wettability of the fibers. The in vitro release of IBP suggested a transition from a gradual release to a fast release when increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers up to 120 min. The in vitro viability of blend PCL/PEO fibers using MTT assays showed that the fibers were compatible with MEF-3T3 fibroblasts. In conclusion, our results explained the scientific correlations between the solution properties and the physicomechanical properties of electrospun fibers. These blend PCL/PEO fibers, having the ability to modulate IBP release, are suitable for topical drug delivery applications.",2024,,"Bani Mustafa D, Sakai T, Sato O, Ikebe M, Chou SF.",https://doi.org/10.3390/polym16131934,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

A cost-effective metal alloy used in biomedical implants was chosen as the substrate, and ibuprofen (Ibu), a well-known anti-inflammatory drug, was selected for drug release tests for its widespread availability and accessibility. Multilayer coatings consisting of cellulose acetate (CA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and chitosan (CHI), with or without ibuprofen (Ibu) content, were applied onto medical-grade stainless steel (SS-316 type) through electrospinning, electrospray, or blow spinning. The adhesion of the CA, PCL, and layered CA/PCL membranes, with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 100 μm, to SS substrates varied between 0.15 N and 0.22 N without CHI, which increased to 0.21 and 0.74 N, respectively, when a CHI interlayer was introduced by electrospraying between the SS and the coatings. Although drug release in a simulated body fluid (SBF) medium is predominantly governed by diffusion-driven mechanisms in all single- and multilayer coatings, a delayed release was noted in CA coatings containing Ibu when overlaid with a PCL coating produced by blow spinning. This suggests avenues for further investigations into combinations of multilayer coatings, both with and without drug-imbued layers.",2024,,"Cidade do Carmo C, Brito M, Oliveira JP, Marques A, Ferreira I, Baptista AC.",https://doi.org/10.3390/polym16142006,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We reported that the synthesis of polyethyleneimine-based sponges was achieved through cryo-polymerization using 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) as the crosslinking agent. Subsequent functionalization with resorcinol diglycidyl ether (RDGE) and trimethylamine introduced quaternary ammonium cations, imparting strong basicity and hydrophilicity, as well as phenyl groups, conferring hydrophobic characteristics, respectively. The aforementioned sponge material, S<sub>HPE-QPI</sub>, primarily facilitates the efficient adsorption of IBU in aqueous solutions through the anion exchange properties of quaternary ammonium groups and the π-π interactions associated with oxygen-activated benzene rings. Various characterizations, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and specific surface area determination method (BET), confirmed the successful synthesis of the bifunctionalized S<sub>HPEI-QP</sub> adsorbent. This adsorbent features a porous structure (specific surface area of 77.2 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and pore size distribution of 25-100 nm) and an isoelectric point (pH<sub>pzc</sub>) of 9.38. The adsorption kinetics of the adsorbent for IBU were extremely rapid and conformed to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption isotherm aligned with the Langmuir isotherm model. Noteworthily, S<sub>HPEI-QP</sub> demonstrated an exceptionally high adsorption capacity for IBU, achieving a maximum uptake of 905.73 mg g<sup>-1</sup> at pH 7.0, which surpassed that of most of the previous reported adsorbents. Moreover, the sponge material can be chemically regenerated. After eight cycles of use, the adsorption efficiency decreased by only 4%. These findings suggest that the synthesized dendritic anion exchange adsorbent represents a promising candidate for the removal of IBU from contaminated water sources.",2025,,"Gou X, Ahmad Z, You Z, Ren Z.",https://doi.org/10.3390/polym17233221,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

However, the response of these devices to potentially interfering nutritional, pharmaceutical, or endogenous substances is barely explored. We previously developed an in vitro test method for continuous and dynamic CGM interference testing and herein explore the sensitivity of the Abbott Libre2 (L2) and Dexcom G6 (G6) sensors to a panel of 68 individual substances.<h4>Methods</h4>In each interference experiment, L2 and G6 sensors were exposed in triplicate to substance gradients from zero to supraphysiological concentrations at a stable glucose concentration of 200 mg/dL. YSI Stat 2300 Plus was used as the glucose reference method. Interference was presumed if the CGM sensors showed a mean bias of at least ±10% from baseline with a tested substance at any given substance concentration.<h4>Results</h4>Both L2 and G6 sensors showed interference with the following substances: dithiothreitol (maximal bias from baseline: L2/G6: +46%/-18%), galactose (>+100%/+17%), mannose (>+100%/+20%), and N-acetyl-cysteine (+11%/+18%). The following substances were found to interfere with L2 sensors only: ascorbic acid (+48%), ibuprofen (+14%), icodextrin (+10%), methyldopa (+16%), red wine (+12%), and xylose (>+100%). On the other hand, the following substances were found to interfere with G6 sensors only: acetaminophen (>+100%), ethyl alcohol (+12%), gentisic acid (+18%), hydroxyurea (>+100%), l-cysteine (-25%), l-Dopa (+11%), and uric acid (+33%). Additionally, G6 sensors could subsequently not be calibrated for use after exposure to dithiothreitol, gentisic acid, l-cysteine, and mesalazine (sensor fouling).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our standardized dynamic interference testing protocol identified several nutritional, pharmaceutical and endogenous substances that substantially influenced L2 and G6 sensor signals.

We conducted the formation of the cocrystalline phase of ibuprofen with coformer nicotinamide to increase its solubility. The purpose of this study was to characterize the solid state of cocrystalline phase of ibuprofen-nicotinamide, determine the solubility, and evaluate its in vivo analgesic activity. The cocrystal of ibuprofen-nicotinamide was prepared by a slow evaporation method. The solid-state characterization was conducted by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis, differential thermal analysis (DTA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To investigate the in vivo analgesic activity, 28 male Swiss-Webster mice were injected with acetic acid 0.5% following oral administration of intact ibuprofen, physical mixture, and its cocrystalline phase with nicotinamide (equivalent to 26 mg/kg ibuprofen). The number of writhes was counted, and pain inhibition was calculated. All data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by Duncan's Multiple Range Test (95% confidence interval).

Modern toxicology methods attempt to deduce a mechanistic understanding of pathways involved in the development of toxicity, by using transcriptomics and other big data-driven methods such as high-content screening. Here, we used a recently described optimised method to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), to assess their potential to classify hepatotoxic and non-hepatotoxic chemicals and their use in mechanistic toxicity studies. The iPSC-HLCs could accurately classify chemicals causing acute hepatocellular injury, and the transcriptomics data on treated HLCs obtained by TempO-Seq technology linked the cytotoxicity to cellular stress pathways, including oxidative stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Induction of these stress pathways in response to amiodarone, diclofenac, and ibuprofen, was demonstrated to be concentration and time dependent. The transcriptomics data on diclofenac-treated HLCs were found to be more sensitive in detecting differentially expressed genes in response to treatment, as compared to existing datasets of other diclofenac-treated in vitro hepatocyte models. Hence iPSC-HLCs generated by transcription factor overexpression and in metabolically optimised medium appear suitable for chemical toxicity detection as well as mechanistic toxicity studies.",2021,,"Ghosh S, De Smedt J, Tricot T, Proença S, Kumar M, Nami F, Vanwelden T, Vidal N, Jennings P, Kramer NI, Verfaillie CM.",https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/10/1/1/pdf?version=1641964305,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

In this context, the article reviews the occurrence, transport, fate, and electrochemical removal of some selected NSAIDs (diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KTP), ibuprofen (IBU), and naproxen (NPX)) using carbon-based anodes in the aquatic environment. However, no specific protocol has been developed to date, and various approaches have been adopted for the sampling and elimination processes of NSAIDs from wastewater samples. The mean concentration of selected NSAIDs from different countries varies considerably, ranging between 3992−27,061 µg/L (influent wastewater) and 1208−7943 µg/L (effluent wastewater). An assessment of NSAIDs removal efficiency across different treatment stages in various wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been performed. Overall, NSAIDs removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants has been reported to be around 4−89%, 8−100%, 16−100%, and 17−98% for DIC, KTP, NPX, and IBU, respectively. A microbiological reactor (MBR) has been proclaimed to be the most reliable treatment technique for NSAIDs removal (complete removal). Chlorination (81−95%) followed by conventional mechanical biological treatment (CMBT) (94−98%) treatment has been demonstrated to be the most efficient in removing NSAIDs. Further, the present review explains that the electrochemical oxidation process is an alternative process for the treatment of NSAIDs using a carbon-based anode. Different carbon-based carbon anodes have been searched for electrochemical removal of selected NSAIDs. However, boron-doped diamond and graphite have presented reliable applications for the complete removal of NSAIDs from wastewater samples or their aqueous solution.",2022,,"Mussa ZH, Al-Qaim FF, Jawad AH, Scholz M, Yaseen ZM.",https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10100598,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study investigates the differential effects of seasonally-varied dissolved organic matter (DOM) from Songhua River and Liao River on the photodegradation of pharmaceutical pollutants, using levofloxacin (LFX), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and ibuprofen (IBP) as target compounds. The results demonstrated that summer and autumn DOM inhibited the photodegradation of LFX and SMZ through light screening and dynamic quenching effects, with inhibition rates of 35.1% and 55.5%, respectively, whereas winter DOM enhanced degradation through photo-oxidation mechanisms. DOM from Songhua River and Liao River significantly promoted the photodegradation of IBP. Quenching experiments showed differences in the contributions of photochemically reactive intermediates (PPRIs) to the photodegradation of different target pollutants, with hydroxyl radicals (•OH) dominating LFX photodegradation (48.79% contribution), excited triplet states of DOM (<sup>3</sup>DOM*) dominating SMZ photodegradation (85.20% contribution), and singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) dominating IBP photodegradation (79.89% contribution). The photodegradation pathways were elucidated by measuring the photodegradation by-products of the target pollutants: LFX mainly underwent piperazine ring cleavage and oxidative decarboxylation, SMZ underwent isoxazole ring opening and deamination during photodegradation, and IBP underwent photodecarboxylation and oxidation reactions. Under the influence of the DOM from the Songhua River and Liao River, the generation of multiple photodegradation by-products led to an increasing trend in the acute toxicity of target pollutants to luminescent bacteria. This investigation elucidates the dual regulatory mechanisms of natural aquatic DOM on both photo-induced degradation pathways and toxicity evolution dynamics of pharmaceutical contaminants, which is of great significance for understanding the photochemical transformation behavior and risk assessment of pharmaceutical pollutants in aquatic environments.",2025,,"Chen Y, Cui J, Cheng F, Qu J, Zhang YN.",https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics13060450,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

PBUTs are associated with comorbidities and mortality in dialysis patients. Albumin is the primary carrier for PBUTs and only a small free fraction of PBUTs are dialyzable. In the past, we proposed a novel method where a binding competitor is infused upstream of a dialyzer into an extracorporeal circuit. The competitor competes with PBUTs for their binding sites on albumin and increases the free PBUT fraction. Essentially, binding competitor-augmented hemodialysis is a reactive membrane separation technique and is a paradigm shift from conventional dialysis therapies. The proposed method has been tested in silico, ex vivo, and in vivo, and has proven to be very effective in all scenarios. In an ex vivo study and a proof-of-concept clinical study with 18 patients, ibuprofen was used as a binding competitor; however, chronic ibuprofen infusion may affect residual kidney function. Binding competition with free fatty acids significantly improved PBUT removal in pre-clinical rat models. Based on in silico analysis, tryptophan can also be used as a binding competitor; importantly, fatty acids or tryptophan may have salutary effects in HD patients.

Protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) are related to cardiovascular and overall mortality, and they are difficult to remove with current hemodialysis treatments. The PBUT displacers, such as furosemide, tryptophan, or ibuprofen, may be promising new strategies for improving their clearance. This study aims to compare ibuprofen versus other analgesic drugs in PBUT removal. A prospective study was carried out in 23 patients. Patients underwent four dialysis sessions with routine dialysis parameters, except for analgesic drugs administered (lysine acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, dexketoprofen, and ibuprofen). The reduction ratios (RRs) of a wide range of molecular weight molecules were assessed, including total p-cresyl sulfate and total indoxyl-sulfate. There were no complications related to the administered drug, and pain was controlled independently of the drug. There were no differences in the RR of small-size and medium-sized molecules between all four study treatments. However, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate RRs when ibuprofen was administered were significantly higher than lysine acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and dexketoprofen treatments.

It has been postulated and shown in adults that MIS may occur after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (MIS-V). Our current case is one of the first published cases with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in an 18-year-old adolescent after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from Pfizer/BionTech (BNT162b2), who fulfills the published level 1 criteria for a definitive disease: age < 21 years, fever > 3 consecutive days, pericardial effusion, elevated CRP/NT-BNP/Troponin T/D-dimeres, cardiac involvement, and positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The disease starts 10 weeks after the second vaccination, with a fever (up to 40 °C) and was treated with amoxicillin for suspected pneumonia. The SARS CoV-2-PCR and several antigen tests were negative. With an ongoing fever, he was hospitalized 14 days later. A pericardial effusion (10 mm) was diagnosed by echocardiography. The C-reactive protein (174 mg/L), NT-BNP (280 pg/mL), and Troponin T (28 pg/mL) values were elevated. Due to highly elevated D-dimeres (>35,000 μg/L), a pulmonary embolism was excluded by thoracal computer tomography. If the boy did not improve with intravenous antibiotics, he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins; however, the therapy was discontinued after 230 mg/kg if he developed high fever and hypotension. A further specialized clinic treated him with colchicine and ibuprofen. The MIS-V was discovered late, 4 months after the onset of the disease. As recently shown in four children with MIS-C after SARS-CoV-2 infection and a girl with Hashimoto thyroiditis after BNT162b2 vaccination, we found elevated functional autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors that may be important for pathophysiology but are not conclusive for the diagnosis of MIS-C. Conclusion: We are aware that a misattribution of MIS-V as a severe complication of coronavirus vaccination can lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and blunt the global COVID-19 vaccination drive. However, the pediatric population is at a higher risk for MIS-C and a very low risk for COVID-19 mortality.

Hence, preparing novel formulations with augmented absorption is a challenge in pharmaceutical industries. In this paper, we have examined the effect of basic amino acids including arginine (ARG), lysine (LYS), and glucosamine (GlucN) on the solubility of ibuprofen (IBU) and piroxicam (PXM) as drugs with limited solubility. We have also studied the effect of the dissolution media with the pH values 1.2 to 7.4.<h4>Methods</h4>The saturation shake-flask method was used for solubility studies in the presence of amino acids. Briefly, buffer solutions containing different concentrations of amino acids were prepared. Then, an excess amount of each drug with these buffers was shaken to reach equilibrium. After 48 hours, the upper phase was separated, and solubility was calculated by reading their UV-Vis absorbance.<h4>Results</h4>The results illustrated that amino acids increased solubility of both drugs with different ratios, which were pH and concentration-dependent. Solubility improved as the amount of amino acids went up, and this upward pattern was more robust with ARG than LYS. The presence of GlucN in citrate buffer significantly enhanced IBU solubility. The solubility of PXM in accompany of GlucN in water did not change significantly while in citrate buffer solubility enhanced specially at pH 6.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overall, GlucN in citrate buffer and ARG in phosphate buffer could be introduced as the most suitable media for IBU and PXM solubility improvement, respectively.",2023,,"Valizadeh H, Mahdinloo S, Zakeri N, Sarfraz M, Nezafat S, Zakeri-Milani P.",https://doi.org/10.34172/apb.2023.067,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Microneedles (MN) are a novel third generation transdermal drug delivery technology that overcomes skin barrier and enables enhanced drug delivery. Ibuprofen has a poor water solubility while Ibuprofen sodium, the salt of ibuprofen offers better solubility in aqueous media and hence quicker absorption into blood stream. The solubility of poor aqueous-soluble ibuprofen was enhanced by Soluplus (SP). The microneedles were fabricated using micromoulding technique.

These drugs inhibit the synthesis and release of prostaglandins （PGs） in the neurons of the anterior hypothalamus and exert therapeutic effects as a consequence. However， these drugs are relatively commonly misused and abused， often owing to a lack of proper medication guidance. As a result， these drugs enter the environment via various pathways， including wastewater treatment plants， agricultural runoff， and improper disposal， thereby posing potential threats to human health and ecosystems. The presence of these contaminants in surface water has become an environmental safety concern that necessitates the development of rapid， accurate， and high-throughput analysis methods. In this study， an analytical method was established for the determination of five antipyretic analgesics （ibuprofen， aminophenazone， antipyrine， phenacetin， and naproxen）. The developed method is based on online solid phase extraction coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry （online SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS）， which provides a high degree of automation and efficiency. Water samples were collected and filtered through 0.2-μm regenerated cellulose （RC） filter membranes， after which Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA and an internal standard were added. An aliquot （0.9 mL） of each sample was injected into the online SPE system using an automatic sampler. Samples were first adsorbed on a PLRP-S online SPE column， washed with 0.05% formic acid aqueous solution， and finally gradient-eluted with a mobile phase composed of 0.2 mmol/L ammonium fluoride solution and methanol-acetonitrile （1∶1， v/v）. Analytes were separated on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column， detected by multiple reaction monitoring with electrospray ionization in both positive- and negative-ion modes， and quantified using the internal-standard method.The five antipyretic analgesics were effectively separated under the optimized experimental conditions and showed good linearities within their respective concentration ranges， with correlation coefficients （<i>r</i>） greater than 0.998. The method detection limits （MDLs） ranged from 0.05 to 0.20 ng/L， and the method quantification limits （MQLs） ranged from 0.20 to 0.80 ng/L. The five antipyretic analgesics exhibited average recoveries of between 64.2% and 112%， with relative standard deviations （RSDs， <i>n</i>=6） of 2.06%-8.99% at low， medium， and high spiked levels. Furthermore， the method was successfully used to analyze water samples from the Hangzhou section of the Qiantang River， in which four target compounds were detected， with antipyrine found to have the highest mass concentration. This newly developed method features a high degree of automation， facilitates the injection of large volumes， and enables online enrichment， purification， and quantitative analysis in an integrated process， with minimal operational errors， high repeatability， and high sensitivity. The developed method shortens sample-analysis times， is more cost-effective， and meets the needs of large-scale sample testing， as it requires only 15 min to completely determine a sample， thereby significantly improving detection efficiency. Overall， the method features low detection limits， analyzes rapidly， and is easy to operate； hence it is suitable for rapid risk screening and the quantitative determination of antipyretic analgesics in surface water.,2025,,"He P, Wang LQ, Zhou S, Zhang BF, Jia X, Chi Y, Xu ZQ, Tang W.",https://doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1123.2024.10018,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The covalent linkage of Phe-Phe and NSAIDs results in conjugates that self-assemble in water to form molecular nanofibers as the matrices of hydrogels. When the NSAID is naproxen (1), the resultant hydrogelator 1a forms a hydrogel at a critical concentration (cgc) of 0.2 wt % at pH 7.0. Hydrogelator 1a, also acting as a general motif, enables enzymatic hydrogelation in which the precursor turns into a hydrogelator upon hydrolysis catalyzed by a phosphatase at physiological conditions. The conjugates of Phe-Phe with other NSAIDs, such as (R)-flurbiprofen (2), racemic flurbiprofen (3), and racemic ibuprofen (4), are able to form molecular hydrogels, except in the case of aspirin (5). After the conjugation with the small peptides, NSAIDs exhibit improved selectivity to their targets. In addition, the peptides made of D-amino acids help preserve the activities of NSAIDs.

The PEG-Ibu conjugates were characterized by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, Mass spectroscopy and DSC analysis. The solubility study in aqueous system showed an increase in solubility of conjugates. The dissolution / hydrolysis studies showed a specific acid-base catalysis pattern dependent on the pH of the medium. This indicated a good chemical stability in aqueous buffer solution of acidic medium and the extended release behavior was found in both prodrugs after 9 hour. The results demonstrate that, in the same condition, the rate of hydrolysis for PEG(4000)-Ibu is slower than other. The Writhing induced by acetic acid experiment and paw edema test after oral administration showed that both conjugates had extended analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects compared with Ibuprofen.

Ibuprofen release from the obtained polymers was preliminarily evaluated at different buffered solutions (pH 1, 7.4, and 10) into dialysis bags to show the capacity of prodrugs to release the drug under hydrolytic conditions. Detection of hydrolysis by UV spectroscopy at selected intervals showed that the drug can be released by selective hydrolysis of the ester bond at the side of the drug moiety.

ZDF rats were hyperglycemic, dyslipidemic and expressed proinflammatory markers in contrast to lean controls, thus reflecting the relationship between obesity and chronic inflammation promoting T2D. Chronic treatment with ibuprofen (2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid) was used to study the impact on pathological T2D conditions as compared to metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide) treated ZDF as well as lean controls. Ibuprofen decreased A1c but induced a high insulin release with improved glucose tolerance only after early time points (i.g., 15 and 30 min) resulting in a non-significant decline of AUC values and translating into a high HOMA-IR. In addition, ibuprofen significantly lowered cholesterol, free fatty acids and HDL-C. Some of these effects by ibuprofen might be based on its anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of cytokine/chemokine signaling (i.g., COX-2, ICAM-1 and TNF-α) as measured in whole blood and epididymal adipose tissue by TaqMan and/or upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.g., IL-4 and IL-13) by ELISA analysis in blood.

However, the efficient delivery of NO donors to tumors remains challenging. The present study used ibuprofen, which has a high binding affinity to human serum albumin (HSA). A total of two types of nitrated forms of ibuprofen, 4-[(nitrooxy)methyl]benzyl 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoate [nitrated ibuprofen benzyl linker (NIB)] and 2-(nitrooxy)ethyl 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propanoate [nitrated ibuprofen ethyl linker (NIE)], were synthesized. It was demonstrated that both NIB and NIE bound to the ibuprofen-binding site of HSA. Although NOx release was observed from NIB, but not NIE, intracellular NO release was detected from both NIB and NIE, which indicated that the mechanisms of NO release may be different for NIB and NIE. Both NIB and NIE induced concentration- and time-dependent cell death in human pancreatic cancer cells, whereas this cell death was not observed with ibuprofen, which could suggest that these cell death-inducing effects may be mediated by NO. The non-specific caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, inhibited cell death induced by NIB and NIE, but activation of caspase 3/7 was not observed.

Bupleurum or TSS is frequently utilized in clinical practice alongside other medications (such as entecavir, lamivudine, compound paracetamol and amantadine hydrochloride capsules), leading to an increased risk of drug-drug interactions. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family serves a critical role in the metabolism of numerous essential drugs (such as tamoxifen, ibuprofen and phenytoin), where the majority of drug interactions involve CYP-mediated metabolism. It is therefore essential to understand the effects of key components of Bupleurum on CYPs when administering combination therapies containing TSS or Bupleurum. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of TSS on the mRNA and protein expression of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 in HepaRG cells. The effects of TSS on the survival of HepaRG cells was investigated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot (WB) analysis were used to assess the effects of different concentrations of TSS (0, 5, 10 and 15 µg/ml) on CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 mRNA and protein expression in HepaRG cells. Based on the CCK-8 assay results, it was observed that the cell viability remained above 80% when treated with 1, 5, 10 and 15 µg/ml TSS. Although there was a statistically significant reduced cell viability at TSS concentrations of 10 and 15 µg/ml compared with the control group, the findings indicated that TSS did not exhibit notable cytotoxic effects at these concentrations. Furthermore, RT-qPCR results revealed that compared with those in the control group, TSS at concentrations of 10 and 15 µg/ml reduced CYP3A4 mRNA expression but increased CYP1A2 mRNA expression in HepaRG cells at concentrations of 15 µg/ml. WB analysis found that TSS at concentrations of 10 and 15 µg/ml downregulated CYP3A4 protein expression in HepaRG cells while increasing CYP1A2 protein expression at concentrations of 15 µg/ml. Results in the present study suggest that TSS can inhibit CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression, but exerts opposite effects on their CYP1A2 counterparts.

Proliferation of cultured human skin fibroblasts was estimated by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell count at increasing concentrations (0.1 nM to 0.1 microM) of LTC4 or LTD4. LTC4 and LTD4 stimulated cell growth in a dose-dependent manner only in the presence of 50 microM indomethacin. Under similar conditions, LTE4 but not LTB4 (0.1 microM) was active. Both asynchronous, growing cells and synchronous, quiescent cells were sensitive to LT when prostaglandin (PG) synthesis was suppressed by indomethacin. Other blockers of cyclooxygenase such as ibuprofen and aspirin exhibited identical permissive activity, and the effect of indomethacin was totally abolished by addition of PGE2. LTC4 modified neither [3H]arachidonic acid release from prelabeled fibroblasts nor PGE2 production by fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that the sulfidopeptide LT stimulate fibroblast proliferation only when the endogenous synthesis of PG is blocked, but they do not enhance the synthesis of PG in their target cells showing no evidence for a negative feed-back loop.

DC matured in conditions that inhibit endogenous PGE(2) release are highly susceptible to apoptosis and exogenous PGE(2) re-establishes the more resistant phenotype.

PGE(2) leads to increased phosphorylation of Akt, protection against mitochondrial membrane compromise, and decreased caspase 3 activity. Macroarray data indicate that PGE(2) leads to the down-regulation of a number of proapoptotic molecules, i.e., BAD, several caspases, and granzyme B. In vivo, higher numbers of immature and Ag-loaded CFSE-labeled DC are present in the draining lymph nodes of mice inoculated with PGE(2) receptor agonists, compared with animals treated with ibuprofen or controls injected with PBS. This suggests that PGE(2) acts as an endogenous antiapoptotic factor for DC and raises the possibility of using PGE(2) agonists to increase the survival of Ag-loaded DC following in vivo administration.",2004,,"Vassiliou E, Sharma V, Jing H, Sheibanie F, Ganea D.",http://www.jimmunol.org/content/173/11/6955.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

The recent discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of lethal sepsis has prompted investigation for development of new experimental therapeutics. We found that many steroidal drugs (such as dexamethasone and cortisone) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin) failed to influence endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release even at superpharmacological concentrations (up to 10-25 microM). However, several steroid-like pigments (tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, and cryptotanshinone) of a popular Chinese herb, Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), dose dependently attenuated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in macrophage/monocyte cultures. A water-soluble tanshinone IIA sodium sulfonate derivative (TSNIIA-SS), which has been widely used as a Chinese medicine for patients with cardiovascular disorders, selectively abrogated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation and release in a glucocorticoid receptor-independent manner. Administration of TSNIIA-SS significantly protected mice against lethal endotoxemia and rescued mice from lethal sepsis even when the first dose was given 24 h after the onset of sepsis. The therapeutic effects were partly attributable to attenuation of systemic accumulation of HMGB1 (but not TNF and NO) and improvement of cardiovascular physiologic parameters (e.g., decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance and increase in cardiac stroke volume) in septic animals. Taken together, these data re-enforce the pathogenic role of HMGB1 in lethal sepsis, and support a therapeutic potential for TSNIIA-SS in the treatment of human sepsis.",2007,,"Li W, Li J, Ashok M, Wu R, Chen D, Yang L, Yang H, Tracey KJ, Wang P, Sama AE, Wang H.",https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article-pdf/178/6/3856/1237022/zim00607003856.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

We aimed to investigate the neuroinflammation mechanism in developing rat brains associated with sevoflurane exposure time, by identifying the specific damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) pathway and evaluating the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in alleviating neuroinflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>A three-step experiment was conducted to investigate neuroinflammation induced by sevoflurane. First, the exposure time required for sevoflurane to cause neuroinflammation was determined. Next, the specific pathways of DAMPs involved in neuroinflammation by sevoflurane were identified. Finally, the effects of NSAIDs on sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation were investigated. The expression of various molecules in the rat brain were assessed using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 112 rats (aged 7 days) were used, of which six rats expired during the experiment (mortality rate, 5.3%). Expression of CD68, HMGB-1, galectin-3, TLR4, TLR9, and phosphorylated NF-κB was significantly increased upon 6 h of sevoflurane exposure. Conversely, transcriptional levels of TNF-α and IL-6 significantly increased and IFN-γ significantly decreased after 6 h of sevoflurane exposure. Co-administration of NSAIDs with sevoflurane anesthesia significantly attenuated TNF-α and IL-6 levels and restored IFN-γ levels.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In conclusion, 6 h of sevoflurane exposure induces neuroinflammation through the DAMPs pathway, HMGB-1, and galectin-3.

Opioids are indeed still at the mainstream of postoperative pain control, but solely using only opioids for postoperative pain management may be connected with risks of complications and adverse effects. As a consequence, the concept of multimodal analgesia has been proposed and is recommended whenever possible. Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drug for its good tolerance and high safety profiles. The introduction of intravenous form of acetaminophen has led to a wider flexibility of its use during peri- and postoperative periods, allowing the early initiation of multimodal analgesia. Many studies have revealed the efficacy, safety and opioid sparing effects of intravenous acetaminophen. Intravenous ibuprofen has also shown to be well tolerated and demonstrated to have significant opioid sparing effects during the postoperative period. However, the number of randomized controlled trials confirming the efficacy and safety is small and should be used in caution in certain group of patients.

The optimized microemulsion-based hydrogel was evaluated for viscosity, spreadability, skin irritancy, skin permeability, stability, and antifungal activity by comparing it with marketed bifonazole cream.<h4>Results</h4>The mechanism of drug release from microemulsion-based hydrogel was observed to follow zero order kinetics. The studied optimized microemulsion-based hydrogel showed a good stability over the period of 3 months. Average globule size of optimized microemulsion (F5) was found to be 18.98 nm, zeta potential was found to be -5.56 mv, and permeability of drug from microemulsion within 8 h was observed 84%. The antifungal activity of microemulsion-based hydrogel was found to be comparable with marketed cream.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results indicate that the studied microemulsion-based hydrogel (F5) has a potential for sustained action of drug release and it may act as promising vehicle for topical delivery of ibuprofen.",2012,,"Sabale V, Vora S.",https://doi.org/10.4103/2230-973X.104397,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Characterization based on surface morphology, particle size, absolute drug content, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was carried out on the SDs. The in vitro release of IB from the SDs was performed in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7.4) without enzymes, whereas the anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using egg albumin-induced rat paw edema model.<h4>Results</h4>Greenish brown, discrete, and irregularly shaped SDs of mean particle size range 113.5 ± 2.5-252.5 ± 1.9 μm, which were stable over 3 months, were obtained. The drug content of the SDs ranged from 73.4 ± 2.9 % to 83.5 ± 2.7%. Although the drug content increased with increased concentration of PEG 8000 in the SDs, the mean particle size decreased with increased concentration of PEG 8000 in the SDs. The FT-IR results indicate no strong chemical interaction of IB and PEG 8000 in the SDs. There was marked increase in the dissolution rate of IB from the SDs (P < 0.05) as compared to pure IB and physical mixture. The dissolution was better in SIF than in SGF. The increased dissolution rate of IB may be due to the formation of microcrystals, increased wettability and dispersibility in PEG 8000. The SDs showed good anti-inflammatory properties achieving up to 90% edema inhibition at 6 h while the pure sample of IB had 77% edema inhibition at 6 h.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SDs based on IB-PEG 8000 is a good approach to enhance the dissolution rate and anti-inflammatory activity of IB, thus, encouraging further development of the SDs.",2016,,"Ofokansi KC, Kenechukwu FC, Ezugwu RO, Attama AA.",https://doi.org/10.4103/2230-973X.187344,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the appropriateness of medications among pregnant women with coexisting illness in a tertiary care hospital, Western India.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>It was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted in the obstetrics and gynecology department of a tertiary care hospital. The study was conducted over a period of 12 months wherein data from 800 pregnant women suffering from any co-existing illness and being prescribed any medication apart from routine supplementation were analyzed. The Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) was used to assess the appropriateness of medications. Higher MAI scores indicate more inappropriate prescribing.<h4>Results</h4>Drugs which were most inappropriately prescribed with the highest average MAI scores were albendazole, itraconazole, injection amikacin, oxcarbazepine, warfarin, domperidone, propylthiouracil, and combiflam (ibuprofen + paracetamol). Diseases with the highest average MAI scores were anemia, Grave's disease, umbilical hernia, urinary tract infection, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, and preeclampsia. The MAI criteria which had the highest percentage of inappropriately prescribed medications were ""cost of drugs,"" ""duration of therapy,"" and ""indication.""<h4>Conclusion</h4>Potentially inappropriate prescribing was seen in the study with some of the common coexisting illness being treated with drugs which fared poorly on the MAI.

Diclofenac among the nonselective NSAIDs has the highest CV risk such as congestive heart failure, which resulted commonly from the impaired cardiac pumping due to a disrupted excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. We investigated the effects of diclofenac on the L-type calcium channels which are essential to the E-C coupling at the level of single ventricular myocytes isolated from neonatal rat heart, using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Only diclofenac of three NSAIDs, including naproxen and ibuprofen, significantly reduced inward whole cell currents. At concentrations higher than 3 microM, diclofenac inhibited reversibly the Na(+) current and did irreversibly the L-type Ca(2+) channels-mediated inward current (IC(50)=12.89+/-0.43 microM) in a dose-dependent manner. However, nifedipine, a well-known L-type channel blocker, effectively inhibited the L-type Ca(2+) currents but not the Na(+) current.

Efforts should be made to increase the success of anesthesia, thus diminishing negative dental experiences. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of preemptive analgesia on the success of pulpal anesthesia following inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) in children with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and on reducing postendodontic pain.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The research design was an <i>in vivo</i>, three-group, parallel, quadruple-blind study. A total of 75 patients were randomly allocated to one of the three groups-group I: ibuprofen, group II: combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol, and group III: multivitamin (placebo). Premedication was given 45 minutes before treatment, and patients received IANB in a standardized manner. Pain during pulpectomy was recorded using the face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scale and postoperatively using Wong-Baker's pain rating scale (WBPRS) at 4, 12, and 24 hours. Success was measured if the pain felt was of no or mild intensity.<h4>Results</h4>Success of IANB was 64% for ibuprofen, 72% for the combination group, and 40% for the placebo group, with no statistically significant difference between all groups (<i>p</i> = 0.06) on the FLACC scale. At 4 hours postoperatively, a significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.02) was found among groups with more children experiencing no or mild pain in groups I and II and the highest number of rescue medications taken by the placebo group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen and a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen as preemptive analgesics had no significant effect on the success rate of IANB, although it was effective in reducing pain at 4 hours postoperatively.<h4>How to cite this article</h4>Gori NA, Patel MC, Bhatt RK, <i>et al.</i> Clinical Assessment of Preemptive Analgesia on Success of Pulpal Anesthesia and Postendodontic Pain in Children with Irreversible Pulpitis: A Randomized Comparative Study.

The most common syndrome is acute mountain sickness (AMS) which usually begins within a few hours of ascent and typically consists of headache variably accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, disturbed sleep, fatigue, and dizziness. With millions of travelers journeying to high altitudes every year and sleeping above 2,500 m, acute mountain sickness is a wide-spread clinical condition. Risk factors include home elevation, maximum altitude, sleeping altitude, rate of ascent, latitude, age, gender, physical condition, intensity of exercise, pre-acclimatization, genetic make-up, and pre-existing diseases. At higher altitudes, sleep disturbances may become more profound, mental performance is impaired, and weight loss may occur. If ascent is rapid, acetazolamide can reduce the risk of developing AMS, although a number of high-altitude travelers taking acetazolamide will still develop symptoms. Ibuprofen can be effective for headache. Symptoms can be rapidly relieved by descent, and descent is mandatory, if at all possible, for the management of the potentially fatal syndromes of high-altitude pulmonary and cerebral edema. The purpose of this review is to combine a discussion of specific risk factors, prevention, and treatment options with a summary of the basic physiologic responses to the hypoxia of altitude to provide a context for managing high-altitude illnesses and advising the non-acclimatized high-altitude traveler.",2011,,Taylor AT.,https://www.rmmj.org.il/userimages/41/1/PublishFiles/44Article.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

There are insufficient data concerning the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the esophageal tissue. We aimed to examine the effects of well-known nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs using electrophysiologic criteria on the rabbit esophageal epithelium.<h4>Methods</h4>Esophageal epithelium mounted on Ussing chambers enabled in vitro investigation of the electrophysiological properties. Doses of 1 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the luminal side. Esophagi were cannulated from both sides for the administration of high-dose ibuprofen in vivo, and the potential difference was monitored.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen and aspirin inhibited tissue transport functions in a dose-dependent manner. pH 4 acid and 0.1 mg/mL ibuprofen alone were not harmful; however, the combination of these agents had an additive and significance effect: 78% decrease in the potential difference and 85% decrease in the short-circuited current (Isc). The change in the potential difference in the in vivo experiments (5 mg/mL ibuprofen) was similar (52 ± 7% decrease) with in vitro experiments in the first 30 minutes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were harmful to the rabbit esophageal epithelium in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Even though aspirin and ibuprofen affected the transport mechanisms of the esophageal epithelium, the dose-dependent decrease of tissue potential difference and Isc with ibuprofen was more pronounced than those with aspirin.

MBG structure and morphology, as well as mesopores size and shape, were investigated by x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. In vitro bioactivity was investigated by soaking MBG membranes in simulated body fluid (SBF) for different time frames. Ibuprofen was encapsulated into MBG pores and drug release kinetics in SBF were assessed. Biological tests by using SAOS-2 cells were performed to assess the material cytocompatibility.<h4>Results</h4>The material revealed significant ability to induce hydroxyapatite formation on its surface (bioactivity). Drug release kinetics in SBF are very similar to those obtained for mesoporous silica having mesopore size comparable to that of the prepared MBG (∼5 nm). No evidence of cell viability depression was detected during in vitro culture, which demonstrates the good biological compatibility of the material.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The easiness of tailoring and shaping, the highly bioactive and biocompatible behavior, and the drug uptake/release ability of the prepared materials may suggest their use as ""smart"" multifunctional grafts for bone reconstructive surgery.",2012,,"Baino F, Fiorilli S, Mortera R, Onida B, Saino E, Visai L, Verné E, Vitale-Brovarone C.",https://doi.org/10.5301/JABFM.2012.9270,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of these substances on inflammation and the expression of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in pulp nerve fibers.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Seventy-two rats were divided into 6 groups as follows: GI, control; GII, only dental bleaching; GIII, only ibuprofen; GIV, ibuprofen administered 30 minutes before and after the bleaching treatment and every 12 hours until the analysis; GV, only topical application of a desensitizing agent; and GVI, topical application of a desensitizing agent before dental bleaching. Placebo gel was applied to the upper left jaw and the bleaching agent was applied to the upper right jaw in all groups. Subsequently, the groups were divided into 3 subgroups based on the time of analysis: 0, 24, and 48 hours after bleaching (<i>n</i> = 8). The rats were euthanized and the maxillae were processed and evaluated by histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Dunn test (<i>p</i> < 0.05).<h4>Results</h4>In the bleaching groups, the inflammatory process and expression of neuropeptides decreased over time. The animals in which a desensitizing agent was applied showed better results within 24 hours.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The use of a desensitizing agent had positive effects on inflammation and pain-related neuropeptide expression, minimizing the painful effects of dental bleaching treatment.",2020,,"da Silva LMAV, Cintra LTA, Gallinari MO, Benetti F, Rahal V, Ervolino E, de Alcântara S, Briso ALF.",http://hdl.handle.net/1843/47208,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Vaginal infections are commonly treated with causal antimicrobial treatments. In addition to specific antimicrobial treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy, both systemic or topical (vaginal douche), could be useful in the integrated treatment approach of these conditions reducing symptoms and speeding up the recovery in vulvovaginitis. Ibuprofen is a well-known effective and well-tolerated anti-COX (anti-COX1 and COX2) compound. In addition, several in vitro studies suggest that Ibuprofen shares antimicrobial and antifungal activities. Ibuprofen isobutanolammonium (Ib-isb) (Ginenorm) is a soluble salt from formulation suitable for external and intravaginal use. This salt completely dissociates in aqueous solution. Ib-isob is available in sachet and vaginal douche pharmaceutical formulations. Clinical efficacy of Ib-isob has been documented in 10 clinical studies (6 controlled and 4 open trials) which have enrolled in total 399 women with vulvovaginitis. The six controlled clinical trials were performed both versus placebo (2 studies) or versus active comparators such as benzydamine. In these studied, Ib-Isb has been used in general for 7 consecutive days with a twice application daily regimen at the dose of 1 g per application. Topical application of Ib-isob induced a marked and rapid reduction in signs (erythema, oedema) and symptoms (itching and burning sensation) of vulvovaginitis. In head-to-head studies carried out in comparison with other topical products, Ib-isob induced a more rapid reduction in both subjective and objective symptoms. In particular a remarkable significant improvement of all the symptoms has been observed in the group of patients treated with Ib-isob in comparison with women receiving benzydamine. The clinical data available for Ib-isob confirm that this salt, specifically developed for gynecological use, is effective and well tolerated in vulvovaginal inflammation conditions. Efficacy of Ib-isob was greater in comparison with commonly used products.

While topical formulations have been explored in pain research, there is no published literature evaluating the efficacy in radicular pain. We present the first three cases of radicular pain successfully treated with a topical formulation of diclofenac, ibuprofen, baclofen, cyclobenzaprine, bupivacaine, gabapentin, and pentoxifylline (T7).<h4>Case presentation</h4>Case series evaluating T7 for treatment of radicular pain in a single, outpatient pain center. Pain was rated on the numeric rating scale (NRS) on initial evaluation and follow up after a trial of T7. One to two grams of T7 was applied to the affected area 3 - 4 times daily in addition to the patient's baseline pharmacologic management. Three patients with median age of 50 (range, 39 to 65) and diagnosis of cervical and/or lumbosacral radicular pain participated. Two of the three had chronic radicular pain despite use of analgesic agents, spinal injections and failed spinal surgery syndrome. Each reported subjective improvement in radicular pain, function and sleep. There was an average decrease in NRS score consistent with 30% - 40% global improvement in symptoms, clinically significant based on the minimal clinically important difference for radicular pain. T7 was well tolerated without adverse reactions. Surgery was prevented or delayed in all cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first report of the successful treatment of radicular pain with a topical agent.

The occurrence of PDA is inversely related to gestational age and weight, with an even greater incidence in preterm infants. The maintenance of ductal patency is essential for the normal development of the fetus. In the neonate, however, persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (DA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Normally, at birth, the DA constricts, resulting in intraluminal ischemic hypoxia, which eventually leads to closure and remodeling of the ductus. PDA in term infants is usually associated with a functional defect, whereas in preterm infants it is associated with immaturity. Normal physiologic mechanisms contributing to closure - oxygen tension and decreased prostaglandins-are altered in prematurity. Clinical signs of ductal patency include murmur, tachycardia, bounding peripheral pulses, and congestive heart failure and associated symptoms. Symptoms are not always present; therefore, diagnostic imaging is critical if a PDA is suspected on clinical grounds. Three management strategies are currently available for PDA: fluid restriction and diuretics (as clinically appropriate), medical intervention, and surgical ligation. Pharmacologic closure can be achieved via administration of intravenous indomethacin or ibuprofen lysine. While both agents have shown similar efficacy, ibuprofen lysine has demonstrated an improved safety profile, particularly in terms of renal effects, compared to indomethacin.",2007,,"Dice JE, Bhatia J.",https://doi.org/10.5863/1551-6776-12.3.138,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Recently, albumin-binding PSMA radioligands with enhanced blood circulation were developed to increase the tumor accumulation of activity. The present study aimed at the design, synthesis and preclinical evaluation of a novel class of PSMA-targeting radioligands equipped with ibuprofen as a weak albumin-binding entity in order to improve the pharmacokinetic properties. <b>Methods</b>: Four novel glutamate-urea-based PSMA ligands were synthesized with ibuprofen, conjugated via variable amino acid-based linker entities. The albumin-binding properties of the <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled PSMA ligands were tested <i>in vitro</i> using mouse and human plasma. Affinity of the radioligands to PSMA and cellular uptake and internalization was investigated using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP and PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumor cells.

PADs may cause congestive heart failure, respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, and renal impairment. Consequently, in some infants, it becomes necessary to attempt closure of the PAD. Surgical closure can be difficult in small infants and is not without its risks; thus, medical closure offers advantages. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors have been used for medical closure of the PAD with both ibuprofen and indomethacin having been used clinically.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify all studies comparing ibuprofen and indomethacin. Studies comparing ibuprofen and indomethacin for closure of the PAD in premature infants were included in the meta-analysis. A subanalysis was performed to compare the route of administration. Efficacy endpoints studied were PAD closure and surgical ligation while adverse effects studied were death in the first month of life, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the first month of life, Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, and change in the serum creatinine after treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen and indomethacin were equally effective in closing the PAD in premature infants and demonstrated no difference in the incidence of adverse events. In respect to the route of administration, oral ibuprofen was as effective as intravenous indomethacin. When comparing both drugs via the intravenous route, the only difference noted between the ibuprofen and indomethacin was that ibuprofen was associated with a lesser increase in serum creatinine after treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen and indomethacin are equally effective in PAD closure without any difference in the incidence of adverse events. Importantly, oral ibuprofen was as effective as intravenous indomethacin.",2015,,"Loomba R, Nijhawan K.",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.274,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
MED,36741676,36741676,10.7759/cureus.33320,Fixed Dose Versus Loose Dose: Analgesic Combinations.,"Combinations of drugs may be fixed (two or more entities in a single product) or loose (two or more agents taken together but as individual agents) to help address multimechanistic pain. The use of opioids plus nonopioids can result in lower opioid consumption without sacrificing analgesic benefits. Drug combinations may offer additive or synergistic benefits. A variety of fixed-dose combination products are available on the market such as diclofenac plus thiocolchicoside, acetaminophen and caffeine, acetaminophen and opioid, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, tramadol and acetaminophen, and others. Fixed-dose combination products offer predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, known adverse events, and can reduce the pill burden. However, they are limited to certain drug combinations and doses; loose dosing allows prescribers the versatility to meet individual patient requirements as well as the ability to titrate as needed. Not all drug combinations offer synergistic benefits, which depend on the drugs and their doses. Certain drugs offer dual mechanisms of action in a single molecule, such as tapentadol, and these may further be used in combination with other analgesics. New technology allows for co-crystal productions of analgesic agents which may further improve drug characteristics, such as bioavailability. Combination analgesics are important additions to the analgesic armamentarium and may offer important benefits at lower doses than monotherapy.",2023,,"Pergolizzi J, Varrassi G, LeQuang JAK, Breve F, Magnusson P.",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.33320,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue that can lead to the release of muscle fiber contents into the bloodstream. This can cause serious damage to the kidneys, leading to AKI. In this case, a young bodybuilder was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis induced by AKI after consuming Ibuprofen for a casual fever. The etiology of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is complex, with multiple factors contributing to the development of the condition. These include muscle trauma, dehydration, infection, and drug toxicity. In this case, Ibuprofen may have contributed to the development of AKI, as it can cause kidney damage when taken in large doses. Additionally, the bodybuilder's physical activity may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis, as intense exercise can cause muscle damage. Treatment for AKI in rhabdomyolysis patients typically involves aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, and dialysis if necessary. Additionally, the underlying cause of the rhabdomyolysis must be identified and treated. In this case, the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of kidney damage, and the Ibuprofen should be discontinued. In conclusion, this is a case of a relatively common presentation with uncommon circumstances. It is crucial to have a heightened understanding of the likelihood of AKI in patients with rhabdomyolysis and the impact of drug toxicity in exacerbating the condition. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for the successful management of AKI.",2023,,"Parammal Alikutty J, Raj A, Soofi SK, Alkhateeb AA, Soliman AA, Al Amiri FR, Abujaber AA, Peediyakkal MZK, Khatib M, Nashwan AJ.",https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/case_report/pdf/135416/20230306-29404-itur38.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

It is caused by the post-viral inflammation and destruction of thyroid follicles. Patients typically present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, as stored thyroid hormone is released into the blood. In this case, we describe a 34-year-old female who presented to the clinic complaining of neck pain and a headache for two days. She endorsed fatigue, myalgias, dizziness, and constipation but denied any fever. She reported only minimal pain relief with ibuprofen and denied a history of recent illness. On exam, she was afebrile and normotensive. Her physical exam was notable for neck tenderness over the right lobe and isthmus of the thyroid, thyromegaly, and a palpable thyroid nodule. Her complete blood count showed no sign of infection or hematologic abnormality, but her thyroid studies showed an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone of 2.1 mIU/L and a decreased thyroxine (T4) level below 0.01 ng/dL. The laboratory results, history, and physical exam led to the diagnosis of the hypothyroid stage of subacute thyroiditis.

The inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) is the most frequently used mandibular injection technique for achieving local anesthesia for endodontic treatment. However, the IANB does not always result in successful pulpal anesthesia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of preoperative administration of both ibuprofen and ketorolac on the efficacy of the IANB in patients with irreversible pulpitis. Methods A total of 60 patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpits of a mandibular posterior tooth randomly received identical capsules of either 400 mg ibuprofen or 20 mg ketorolac or a placebo 1 hour before the administration of a conventional IANB. Access was initiated after profound lip numbness was achieved. Success was defined as no, mild, moderate, or severe pain (verbal rating scale recordings) on accessing the dentin, pulp, and debridement. Results Ketorolac was associated with superior efficacy in pain reduction when compared with ibuprofen and placebo in all parameters, namely the dentin, pulp, and canal debridement. Interpretation and conclusion In conclusion, for mandibular posterior teeth, a preoperative dose of 400 mg of ibuprofen or 20 mg of ketorolac showed a statistically significant increase in the success of the IANB in patients with irreversible pulpitis.",2019,,"Kaladi SR, Tegginmani V, M M, Mitta S, Chigadani P, Viswanadhan A.",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.6346,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"

There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization. A hindrance to this development is the vast amount of misinformation present due to scarcely sourced manuscript preprints and social media. This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments. The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice. Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated. Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19. These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment. Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated. Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified. Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described. Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed. The penultimate portion of the review aims to explain the involvement of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in COVID19 treatment and prophylaxis. Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented. Lastly, the current scientific data and status of governing bodies such as the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO on the usage of controversial therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen), and corticosteroids usage in COVID-19 are discussed.

The medications most frequently associated with TEN include antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sulfonamides), penicillins, cephalosporins, and quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin); anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially oxicam derivatives (e.g., piroxicam), and, less commonly, ibuprofen; allopurinol; nevirapine; and other agents such as paracetamol, celecoxib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immunobiological therapies like infliximab. We describe a 71-year-old, functionally dependent male who developed fever and progressive skin detachment after self-medicating with paracetamol and ibuprofen. Examination revealed widespread bullae and skin sloughing involving approximately 70% of his total body surface area (TBSA). Despite supportive measures, the patient rapidly deteriorated and died on the second day of hospitalization. TEN was assumed as the primary cause of death. The prognosis in TEN is strongly influenced by age, comorbidities, and the extent of skin involvement. Genetic predispositions, such as HLA-B<i>15:02</i> (associated with carbamazepine-induced TEN, particularly in Southeast Asian populations), HLA-A31:01 (carbamazepine hypersensitivity in European, Japanese, and Latin American populations), and HLA-B*58:01 (allopurinol-induced TEN in Asian populations), are important risk factors that guide genetic screening recommendations before prescribing certain high-risk drugs. Supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment for TEN, focusing on meticulous wound care, fluid and electrolyte management, infection prevention, and pain control. However, the use of immunomodulatory therapies, such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and biologics, remains a subject of ongoing debate, with inconsistent evidence regarding their efficacy. Timely recognition of TEN and immediate cessation of the offending drug are paramount to improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality. This case highlights the potential role of ibuprofen, a commonly used over-the-counter NSAID, as a trigger for TEN, particularly in frail elderly individuals. Although ibuprofen is generally considered a low-risk medication, its capacity to induce severe cutaneous adverse reactions should not be underestimated. The prognosis in TEN is heavily influenced by factors such as advanced age, existing comorbidities, and the extent of skin involvement. Given the high fatality rates associated with TEN, especially in older adults, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with acute mucocutaneous symptoms following recent drug exposure, including over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen, and emphasize the importance of public education on the dangers of unsupervised self-medication.",2025,,"Pereira da Silva T, Santos ML, Brito AP, Fernandes M, Cotter J.",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.89368,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")"
