ETH,470960,,,Subcellular actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs : lysosome and prostaglandin studies,"The stabilization of lysosomal membranes and the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis are two of the many proposed mechanisms whereby anti-inflammatory drugs may exert their therapeutic action. In this context, the subcellular actions of certain non-steroidal agents have been investigated using in vitro techniques. Under specific conditions, rat liver lysosomal membranes were stabilized by aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin, flurbiprofen and chloroquine as assessed by the release of free acid phosphatase or beta-glucuronidase. The lysosomal enzymes were not inhibited by the above agents at therapeutic doses. Attempts were made to extend these studies to the inflammatory important lysosomes of polymorphonucelar leucocytes but difficulties were encountered. Although both ibuprofen and flurbiprofen decreased the inflammatory response in adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat, no correlation was observed between paw size and total paw lysosomal levels. Prostaglandin biosynthesis was investigated in preparations of rabbit renal medullae and bovine seminal vesicles using a radiochemical technique. The synthesis of radioactive PGE2 and PGF2alpha from labelled precursor, arachidonic acid, was inhibited by non-steroidal ...

Similar incubation studies gave no indication of a change in the enantiomeric ratios of ibuprofen over the time course of the experiments. Percutaneous penetration studies of ibuprofen gel through porcine skin indicated that the ibuprofen enantiomer levels in the reservoir solutions were consistent with racemic ibuprofen having traversed the skin with no metabolic inversion.

The main treatments are compression bandages and dressings. As these ulcers are often painful some clinicians choose particular dressings and topical treatments (analgesia/ local anaesthetic) to reduce the pain both during and between dressing changes.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effectiveness of dressings, local anaesthetics or topical analgesia for pain relief in venous leg ulceration.<h4>Search strategy</h4>For this update the search strings were revised and the following databases were searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 16/12/09) The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2009; Ovid MEDLINE - 1950 to November Week 3 2009; Ovid EMBASE - 1980 to 2009 Week 50; EBSCO CINAHL - 1982 to December 16 2009. No date or language restrictions were applied.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials which evaluated local interventions used to relieve venous leg ulcer pain were considered. Pain was defined as either persistent pain or pain at dressing changes or debridement. Ulcer healing and reported adverse events were also considered as further outcomes.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Eligibility for inclusion was confirmed by two review authors who independently assessed the potential trials.<h4>Main results</h4>Two trials evaluating interventions for persistent venous leg ulcer pain were identified for this review update. Both studies evaluated ibuprofen slow release foam dressings; one comparing it with local best practice and the other with an identical foam comparator. The primary end point for both studies was ""pain relief achieved"". When compared with a foam dressing alone, there was no evidence of a statistically significant effect of the ibuprofen foam dressing in terms of achieving some pain relief the first evening after treatment: 74% in the ibuprofen group (46/62) had pain relief compared with 58% (35/60) in the foam group (no significant difference: RR 1.27, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.65). In the second study 100% (32/32) of people with venous ulcers achieved some pain relief with the ibuprofen dressing on the first evening of treatment compared with 93% (26/28) in the local best practice group (no significant difference: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21). Pooling these studies in a meta-analysis (using a random effects model as significant heterogeneity present (p=0.1), I(2) = 64%) there is no evidence that ibuprofen dressings increase the pain relief experienced by the first evening of use (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44). We were not able to extract sufficient data to combine other pain outcomes from these trials. There was no difference in healing rates but slightly more adverse events with ibuprofen dressings than with a similar foam dressing without ibuprofen.Six trials evaluated interventions for the pain associated with debridement and were considered sufficiently similar to pool. There was a statistically significant reduction in debridement pain scores with 5% Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream; the difference in means (measured on a 100 mm scale) was 20.6 mm (95% CI 12.19 to 29.11). Of these six trials, only one small trial measured healing as an outcome and found no difference in the numbers of ulcers healed at the end of the study.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is no evidence that ibuprofen dressings offer pain relief, as measured at the first evening of use, to people with painful venous leg ulcers compared with foam dressings or best practice.EMLA appears to provide effective pain relief for venous leg ulcer debridement but the effect (if any) of EMLA on ulcer healing remains unknown.",2010,,"Briggs M, Nelson EA.",https://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/499/1/Topical%20agents%20or%20dressings%20for%20pain%20in%20venous%20leg%20ulcers.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Data on in vitro permeation', 'Methods for assessing permeation', 'Results related to ibuprofen release metrics']","The study evaluates ibuprofen foam dressings in venous leg ulcers, indicating a focus on formulation and measurable endpoints related to drug release and effect.

The main treatments are compression bandages and dressings. Topical treatments to reduce pain during and between dressing changes are sometimes used.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the effects of topical agents or dressings for pain in venous leg ulcers.<h4>Search methods</h4>For this third update the following databases were searched: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 9 May 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (2009 to April Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations May 08, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2009 to 2012 Week 18); and EBSCO CINAHL (2009 to May 2 2012). No date or language restrictions were applied.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of topical agents or dressing for the treatment of pain in venous ulcers were included.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently performed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment.<h4>Main results</h4>Six trials (343 participants) evaluated Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream for the pain associated with ulcer debridement. The between-group difference in pain measured on a 100 mm scale was statistically significant in favour of EMLA (MD -20.65, 95% CI -12.19 to -29.11). No significant between-group differences in burning or itching were observed.Two trials (470 participants with venous leg ulcers) evaluated ibuprofen slow-release foam dressings for persistent venous leg ulcer pain. Compared with local best practice, significantly more participants in the ibuprofen dressing group achieved the outcome of >50% of the total maximum pain relief score between day 1 and day 5 than participants in the local best practice group (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.15). The number needed to treat was 6 (95% CI 4 to 12). In the second trial, compared with an identical non-ibuprofen foam dressing, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing slight to complete pain relief on the first evening of treatment.Limited data were available to assess healing rates or adverse events.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. EMLA (5%) appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers.

Thus, this work reports on the production, characterization, and release kinetics of a poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) microporous membrane containing a zeolite (Faujasite) and a magnetic stimuli-sensitive component, magnetostrictive Terfenol-D (TD), for the release of ibuprofen (IBU) as drug model. For membranes containing IBU-loaded zeolites and TD without an applied AC magnetic field, the release kinetics is characterized by a first order release. On the other hand, the application of an AC magnetic field modifies the release profile of the membrane, leading to an increase of the release rate by more than 30%, the magnetically driven release being characterized by a super case-II within the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, indicating a release mainly driven by a swelling or erosion mechanism, induced by the magnetostrictive particles under the applied magnetic field. The increase of the TD w/w from 10% to 20% has as a consequence a decrease in the quantity of IBU released from 79% to 70%; on the contrary, increasing the H <sub>AC</sub> intensity from 100 to 200 mT promotes an increase on the percentage of IBU released from 67% to 75%.",2016,,"Barbosa J, Correia DM, Gonçalves R, Ribeiro C, Botelho G, Martins P, Lanceros-Mendez S.",https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.201600591,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on the diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics of the magnetically controlled release mechanism', 'Characterization methods for the PLLA membrane', 'Full release kinetics data', 'Comparative analysis without magnetic field']","This study focuses on the release kinetics of ibuprofen using a specially designed membrane in a magnetically controlled system, which is relevant for the PermeationNet dataset.",0.9

MED,18985797,18985797.0,10.1002/bdd.631,Skin disposition of menthol after its application in the presence of drug substances.,"Many drug products that are applied onto the skin contain menthol. Menthol plays a dual role in the analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs: it causes cooling and local anesthetic effects and, being a penetration enhancer, it increases the skin permeation of the drug substances. However, there are no data concerning the skin penetration of menthol after its application in the most commonly used vehicles and in the presence of drug substances. Therefore, this study evaluated the ex vivo skin disposition of menthol after application of the commercially available drug products containing aluminum acetotartrate, methyl salicylate, ibuprofen and naproxen, using full human-skin mounted in flow-through diffusion cells. After 15, 30 and 60 min of application, the skin was progressively tape-stripped into three fractions of stratum corneum and the remaining epidermis with dermis. The content of menthol in the skin layers was determined by GC method. Varying degrees of penetration of menthol into the skin layers was observed, depending on its amount in the vehicle and the presence of drug substance. In the presence of aluminum acetotartrate, the skin penetration of menthol was limited only to the outer fraction of the stratum corneum.

The effects of the mobile phase composition, concentration of HP-beta-CD and column temperature on retention and enantioselective separation were investigated. With 2-APA NSAIDs as acidic analytes, the retention times and resolutions of the enantiomers were strongly related to the pH of the mobile phase. In addition, both the concentration of HP-beta-CD and temperature had a great effect on retention time, but only a slight or almost no effect on resolutions of the analytes. Enantioseparations were achieved on a Shimpack CLC-ODS (150 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 microm) column. The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 4.0-5.5, 20 mM) containing 25 mM HP-beta-CD.

A well-studied gel-inducing supramolecular synthon, namely primary ammonium monocarboxylate (PAM), has been exploited to generate a series of PAM salts by reacting ibuprofen with various primary amines. Remarkably, all of the salts (S1-S7) thus synthesized proved to be good to moderate gelators of various polar and nonpolar solvents. Single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction studies established the existence of the PAM synthons in the gel network, confirming the efficacy of the supramolecular synthon approach employed. Most importantly, the majority of the salts (S2, S3, S6, and S7) were capable of gelling methyl salicylate (MS), an important ingredient found in many commercial topical gels. In vitro experiments (MTT and PGE2 assays) revealed that all of the salts (except S3 and S7) were biocompatible (up to 0.5 mm concentration), and the most suited one, S6, displayed anti-inflammatory ability as good as that of the parent drug ibuprofen. A topical gel of S6 with methyl salicylate and menthol was found to be suitable for delivering the gelator drug in a self-delivery fashion in treating skin inflammation in mice. Histological studies, including immunohistology, were performed to further probe the role of the gelator drug S6 in treating inflammation.

Patients were classified according to tolerance patterns to NSAIDs and other COX inhibitors (COXi) and compared for epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 87% of adults and 91% of pediatric patients tolerated NSAIDs and other COXi. Among adult and pediatric patients presenting DHRs, 5% and 0% reacted to multiple NSAIDs, 4% and 0.7% were single reactors, and 3% and 8% were single reactors with known tolerance to paracetamol but unknown tolerance to other COXi, respectively. Among adults, hypersensitivity to ≥2 drugs was more frequent among females (p = 0.009), patients with prior history of anaphylaxis to triggers other than NSAIDs or other COXi and Hymenoptera venom (p = 0.009), presence of baseline flushing (p = 0.02), baseline serum tryptase ≥48 ng/ml (p = 0.005) and multilineage KIT mutation (p = 0.02). In contrast, tolerance to NSAIDs and other COXi was more frequent among males (p = 0.02), in patients with anaphylaxis caused by Hymenoptera venom (p = 0.02), among individuals who had skin lesions due to mastocytosis (p = 0.01), and in cases that had no baseline pruritus (p = 0.006). Based on these parameters, a score model was designed to stratify mastocytosis patients who have never received NSAIDs or other COXi apart from paracetamol, according to their risk of DHR.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results suggest that despite the frequency of MC mediator related symptoms elicited by NSAIDs and other COXi apart from paracetamol is increased among mastocytosis patients versus the general population, it is lower than previously estimated and associated with unique disease features. Patients that tolerated NSAIDs and other COXi following disease onset should keep using them.

Neat and two types of RosA-loaded cellulose acetate (CA) mats varying in the initial content of RosA were electrospun. Microstructure of nanofibers, chemistry and physical state of RosA in nanofibers, RosA loading efficiency and RosA release in acetate buffer were investigated. To evaluate bioactivity of RosA-loaded nanofibers, their ability to inhibit protein denaturation was assayed as an indicator of anti-inflammatory properties and their antioxidant activity was determined by radical scavenging assay. The indirect cytotoxicity assay was used to find if there is a cytotoxic response to nanofibers. The homogeneous distribution of the drug within nanofibers through electrospinning led to high loading efficiency, low burst release and prolonged release of a large percentage of RosA over a period of 64h following Fickian diffusion mechanism. Nanofibers with higher RosA content exhibited anti-inflammatory activity comparable to ibuprofen, and higher antioxidant activity compared to nanofibers with lower RosA content. Additionally, extracts from nanofibers did not give any major harmful effect on cells.

MED,30370675,30370675.0,10.1002/etc.4302,Effects of skin region and relative lipophilicity on percutaneous absorption in the toad Rhinella marina.,"Owing to the dynamic interaction between frog skin and the environment, xenobiotics in frog habitats are of particular concern, and knowledge of percutaneous absorption in frog skin is necessary for risk-mitigation purposes. Baseline transdermal kinetics in adult aquatic and arboreal frog species have recently been reported; however, there is little information regarding absorption kinetics in adult terrestrial species. The present study investigated the in vitro absorption kinetics of 3 model chemicals-caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen-through different skin regions in the terrestrial toad Rhinella marina. Caffeine flux was consistently higher than that of the other 2 chemicals (p < 0.001), whereas the fluxes of the moderately and highly lipophilic chemicals (benzoic acid and ibuprofen) were similar, regardless of skin region. When considering individual chemicals, caffeine demonstrated increased flux through the ventral pelvic skin compared with the ventral thoracic or dorsal skin regions. Flux did not differ between skin regions for either benzoic acid or ibuprofen. These findings have implications for management of environmental contamination in frog habitats, as many environmental xenobiotics are of moderate to high lipophilicity and would be expected to be equally absorbed from all skin surfaces in terrestrial toads.

The objective of this study was to investigate the significance of the basophil activation test (BAT) for allergy diagnosis work up.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 14 patients (5 men, 9 women; mean age: 57.8 years) with clinical records of anaphylactic reactions under general anesthesia were studied by means of anesthesia records, skin and serological tests. Eleven healthy subjects without any history of allergic sensitization to anaesthetic drugs served as controls. BATs based on stimulation of whole blood cells measuring CD63 activation of basophils and using CCR3 as basophil marker by flow cytometry (Flow CAST®, BÜHLMANN Laboratories AG, Schönenbuch, Switzerland) were performed with the following substances (in dependence on the history and the skin tests of the patient): analgesics (acetylsalicylic acid, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indometacin, metamizole, paracetamol, propyphenazone, tramadol), antibiotics (PPL (benzylpenicilloyl polylysine), MDM (minor determinant mixture), amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, roxithromycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim), local anesthetics (articaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, prilocaine, procaine, methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate), narcotics and NMBA (atracurium, cisatracurium, etomidate, neostigmine, midazolam, mivacurium, pancuronium, propofol, pyridostigmine, succinylcholine, sufentanil, thiopental, vecuronium), and other individual substances.<h4>Results</h4>Three patients showed positive results in the BAT: One to metamizole, one to PPL, and one to pancuronium.

Most of these models cater only to a phase of drug release from a constant reservoir. All these models, however, are not applicable to drug release from biodegradable triple-layered microparticle system, in which the drug-loaded core (reservoir) is surrounded by nondrug holding outer layers (membrane). In this article, a mathematical model was developed for ibuprofen release from degradable triple-layered microparticles made of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide, 50:50) (PLGA), poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate, 40 wt % vinyl acetate) (EVA), where ibuprofen was localized within the nonconstant reservoir (EVA core). The model postulated that the drug release through the bulk-degrading PLLA and PLGA layers consisted of two mechanisms: simple diffusional release followed by a degradation-controlled release through a rate-limiting membrane. The proposed model showed very good match with the experimental data of release from microparticles of various layer thicknesses and particle sizes. The underlying drug release mechanisms are dictated by three parameters determined by the model, including constant characteristic of diffusion, end time point of simple diffusion-controlled release and partition coefficient of drug.

The deliverable dose of powder exiting the device is approximately 50% of the total cassette loading; the rest is lost via a gap forced open between the injector base and the surface of the target gel. It could be shown that substantial comminution of two different ibuprofen particle size fraction (38-53 microm, 53-75 microm) occurs within the injector on actuation. This resulted in an equiparation of the two initially different size fractions. Reduced comminution occurs with an ibuprofen/PVP (95:5) particulate formed by spray-drying/compaction/milling. On actuation into excised human skin membranes approximately 37% of cassette dose is recovered from the stratum corneum by stripping, and only 3% from the epidermis. It is concluded that powder delivery is mainly intra-epidermal with few particles fully breaching the stratum corneum. This is a consequence of the relative magnitude of the particle diameter (approximately 48 microm) and the stratum corneum thickness (approximately 10 microm). A 'soft' polyethylene glycol monolayer target gel gives the closest total percentage recovery of powder to that seen with the excised human skin membranes.

The influence of these properties on transdermal formulation development, especially the relative effect of lowered melting point, on skin permeation must be carefully assessed to provide the most efficacious formulation. Thermodynamic properties and crystalline structures of the enantiomers, eutectics, and racemate of chiral ibuprofen were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. The effect of melting point lowering on membrane permeation rates was mathematically modeled. Model was validated by in vitro skin permeation experiments using different preparations of racemic ibuprofen, enantiomer, and eutectic. Both enantiomer and eutectic formed a two-phase liquid system containing an emulsifiable aqueous phase and an oily phase in the presence of aqueous isopropyl alcohol (aIPA). The eutectic emulsion had the highest permeation rate, a 2.21-fold increase in flux compared with saturated aIPA solutions of the racemate with a 2.03-fold increase in flux. Results from the two-phase liquid system supported those from the mathematical models, albeit somewhat lower, and confirmed their use in predicting maximum flux utilizing thermodynamic data.

The work is based on our previous results that, in particular, extend the well-known Higuchi model. Recently, we have introduced a numerical transient model describing matrix systems where the drug dissolution can be non-instantaneous. Furthermore, our model can describe complex interactions within a multi-layered matrix and the matrix to skin boundary. The power of the modelling approach presented here is further illustrated by allowing the possibility of a donor solution. The model is validated by a comparison with experimental data, as well as validating the parameter values against each other, using various configurations with donor solution, silicone matrix and skin. Our results show that the model is a good approximation to real multi-layered delivery systems. The model offers the ability of comparing drug release for ibuprofen and diclofenac, which cannot be analysed by the Higuchi model because the dissolution in the latter case turns out to be limited.

In vitro permeability experiments were performed in side-by-side diffusion cells with diclofenac, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen and human skin. The donor solution pH significantly affected skin permeation of NSAIDs, whereas no effect of the receiver pH was observed. Similar to previous observations, the apparent permeability coefficient versus donor solution pH relationships deviated from the predictions (fractions of unionized NSAIDs) according to the acid/base theory. The influences of the viable epidermis barrier, polar pathway transport, ion permeation across skin, and effective skin pH were investigated.

The release studies showed extended-release of IBU (20-60% in 15 d), which can be triggered under the stimulation of lipase. The in vitro studies indicate that the representative polymers are effective in relieving inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophage cells without any cytotoxicity.

To examine how SOs affect inflammation, cytokine antibody arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to assess changes in production of cytokines and chemokines by co-cultured human dermal fibroblasts and neo-epidermal keratinocytes exposed to lipopolysaccharides and SOs from Western Australian and East Indian sandalwood trees or to the primary SO components, α-santalol and β-santalol. Lipopolysaccharides stimulated the release of 26 cytokines and chemokines, 20 of which were substantially suppressed by simultaneous exposure to either of the two sandalwood essential oils and to ibuprofen. The increased activity of East Indian SO correlated with increased santalol concentrations. Purified α-santalol and β-santalol equivalently suppressed production of five indicator cytokines/chemokines at concentrations proportional to the santalol concentrations of the oils. Purified α-santalol and β-santalol also suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the arachidonic acid metabolites, prostaglandin E2, and thromboxane B2, by the skin cell co-cultures. The ability of SOs to mimic ibuprofen non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs that act by inhibiting cyclooxygenases suggests a possible mechanism for the observed antiinflammatory properties of topically applied SOs and provides a rationale for use in products requiring antiinflammatory effects.",2014,,"Sharma M, Levenson C, Bell RH, Anderson SA, Hudson JB, Collins CC, Cox ME.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.5080,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Methods of permeability assessment', 'Specifics on experimental setup with Franz cells']","The study focuses on cytokine production suppression, not on ibuprofen permeation or formulation specifics.

Accordingly, we have exploited the heme-catalyzed hydroperoxidase activity of recombinant hCOX-2 to generate luminescence in the presence of luminol, or a cyclic naphthalene hydrazide, and the substrate arachidonic acid. Arachidonate-induced luminescence was shown to be an index of real-time catalytic activity and demonstrated the turnover inactivation of the enzyme. Luminol luminescence was proportional to hCOX-2 concentration and gave accurate Km determinations for arachidonate. Inhibition of hCOX-2 activity, measured by luminescence, by a variety of selective (for COX-2) and nonselective inhibitors showed rank orders of potency similar to those observed with other in vitro and whole cell methods using the recombinant protein. The sensitivity of the luminescence assay also allowed determination of inhibitor potency at substrate concentrations below Km, distinguishing competitive inhibitors such as ibuprofen from time-dependent inhibitors such as DuP-697.

MED,2488090,2488090.0,10.1007/bf00133206,Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion: the role of oxygen radicals in tissue injury.,"Thrombolytic therapy has gained widespread acceptance as a means of treating coronary artery thrombosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Although experimental data have demonstrated that timely reperfusion limits the extent of infarction caused by regional ischemia, there is growing evidence that reperfusion is associated with an inflammatory response to ischemia that exacerbates the tissue injury. Ischemic myocardium releases archidonate and complement-derived chemotactic factors, e.g., leukotriene B4 and C5a, which attract and activate neutrophils. Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium accelerates the influx of neutrophils, which release reactive oxygen products, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl radical and hypochlorous acid. The latter two species may damage viable endothelial cells and myocytes via the peroxidation of lipids and oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups, leading to perturbations of membrane permeability and enzyme function. Neutrophil depletion by antiserum and inhibition of neutrophil function by drugs, e.g., ibuprofen, prostaglandins (prostacyclin and PGE1), or a monoclonal antibody, to the adherence-promoting glycoprotein Mo-1 receptor, have been shown to limit the extent of canine myocardial injury due to coronary artery occlusion/reperfusion. Recent studies have challenged the hypothesis that xanthine-oxidase-derived oxygen radicals are a cause of reperfusion injury. Treatment with allopurinol or oxypurinol may exert beneficial effects on ischemic myocardium that are unrelated to the inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Furthermore, the human heart may lack xanthine oxidase activity. Further basic research is needed, therefore, to clarify the importance of xanthine oxidase in the pathophysiology of reperfusion injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989,,"Werns SW, Lucchesi BR.",http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44595/1/10557_2004_Article_BF00133206.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"[""Investigate any mention of ibuprofen's formulation"", 'Check for measurable endpoints related to tissue injury', 'Look for relevant in vitro permeability data']","The abstract discusses ibuprofen in the context of myocardial injury rather than in vitro permeation studies, making it likely irrelevant to the specific dataset requirements.",0.8

Dose-response and time-course considerations make it unlikely that these effects are mediated via the glucocorticoid receptor, a concept further supported by the ability of sex steroids to work similar effects. We postulated that steroids nonspecifically altered granulocyte membrane fluidity, which we measured directly by electron paramagnetic resonance. As predicted, methylprednisolone caused a dose-dependent increase in order parameter (decrease in fluidity) calculated on the basis of EPR spectra, using 5-doxylstearic acid (5-DS) as a probe of resting PMN membranes. This trend was highly significant (P less than 0.001; P at 0.5 mg/ml less than 0.01). Qualitatively similar results (but with different dose-response features) were obtained with conjugated estrogen. Granulocyte agonists (such as PMA) showed an opposite effect, which was not oxidatively mediated and which was steroid-inhibitable. 16-DS showed less prominent effects, suggesting that the membrane leaflets were more strongly affected than was the deep region of the membrane. Ibuprofen, which has similar effects to those of methylprednisolone on PMN aggregation and receptor function, caused a fluidizing rather than a stiffening of the membrane; this surprising result may indicate that there is a critical range of membrane fluidity for normal function, outside of which--in either direction--agonist receptor dysfunction occurs.

Benzydamine (6.25-50 microM) inhibited Candida-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and, to a lesser extent, interleukin-1 beta production, whereas it did not affect interleukin-6 release. Benzydamine also blocked monocyte chemotactic protein-1 secretion, but it did not affect interleukin-8 production.

COX-2 inhibition was assessed by measuring 6-keto-PGF1alpha in supernatants of intact cells of LPS-stimulated J774.2 cells (murine) and of Mono Mac 6 cells (human). In whole blood inhibition of COX-1 was performed by measuring TXB2 formation after clotting, and COX-2 inhibition was examined in LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures.

The effect of different concentrations of indomethacin, sodium salicylate, ibuprofen, meloxicam, lysine clonixinate or NS-398 administrated 30 min before concentration-response curves (CRC) was studied.

Moreover, in this tissue, the NS-398 pKb (5.2) observed suggests that COX-2 pathway is the most relevant. The strong correlation between published pIC50 for COX-2 and the NSAIDs' pKbs estimated further supports the hypothesis that COX-2 metabolites are involved in BK B1 receptor-mediated responses. In other rings, indomethacin (30, 100 micromol/l) or NS-398 (10, 30 micromol/l) produced a significant rightward shift of the CRC to BK, selective BK B2 agonist, and its pKbs were similar to the values to inhibit BK B1 receptor responses, suggesting that COX-2 pathway also is involved in BK B2 receptor responses.

Commercially available cattle intestine natural membranes (NM), polyethersulfone (PES), and regenerated cellulose-based (RC) flat membranes (nominal cut-off 1 kDa) have been investigated as ultrafiltration membranes in a small tangential-flow ultrafiltration unit (TF-UF). First, the nominal cut-off of the NM membranes under study was assessed at approximately 5 kDa, by using polystyrenesulfonate standards for pore-size classification at low TF-UF pressure (0.25 x 10(5) Pa). Working pressures of >1.5 x 10(5) Pa strongly increased the cut-off of NM, in contrast with that of PES and RC membranes. Sulfa, Carba, Diclo and Ibu (1 mg L(-1) each) in colloid-free aqueous solutions (400 mg L(-1) NaCl) completely permeated through NM membranes, but less through PES and RC, which had particular sorption capability towards Diclo. The drugs were routinely determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Detailed TF-UF investigation of drug retention on NM in the presence of humic hydrocolloids revealed strong interactions between aquatic humic substances (HS) and Diclo and Ibu (but not with Sulfa and Carba) causing retention of up to 80% of Diclo and Ibu, probably because of their binding to macromolecular HS. The standard deviation (SD) of both drug and HS permeation through a single NM was between 2.5 (Sulfa) and 4.0% (Diclo), in contrast with the SD of permeation through separate membranes taken from different lots [SD up to 14.0% (Diclo)], presumably caused by natural variation of the studied NM.

In this study the behaviour of several pharmaceutical products in different therapeutic categories (analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid regulators, antibiotics, etc.) was monitored during treatment of wastewater in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The results were compared with removal in a conventional activated-sludge (CAS) process in a wastewater-treatment facility. The performance of an MBR was monitored for approximately two months to investigate the long-term operational stability of the system and possible effects of solids retention time on the efficiency of removal of target compounds. Pharmaceuticals were, in general, removed to a greater extent by the MBR integrated system than during the CAS process. For most of the compounds investigated the performance of MBR treatment was better (removal rates >80%) and effluent concentrations of, e.g., diclofenac, ketoprofen, ranitidine, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, pravastatin, and ofloxacin were steadier than for the conventional system.

Epithelial cells of the intact cornea were impaled with microelectrodes. Under short-circuit current (I(sc)) conditions, 10(-4) M ibuprofen (IBU) (non-specific COX inhibitor) or 5 x 10(-5) M rofecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) were added to the tear solution. With ibuprofen, I(sc) decreased by 1.0 from 3.1 microA/cm2; intracellular potential, V(o), depolarized by 14.2 from -56.9 mV; IBU did not affect the transepithelial conductance, g(t), or the apical membrane fractional resistance, fR(o). With rofecoxib, I(sc) decreased by 0.9 from 4.3 microA/cm2; V(o) depolarized by 18 from -62.4 mV; g(t) significantly increased by 0.03 from 0.37 ms/cm2; and fR(o) decreased by 12 from 50. Basolateral membrane K+ and apical membrane Cl- partial conductances were studied by the ion substitution method. Depolarization of V(o) by an increase in stromal K+ from 4 to 79 mM was smaller with IBU (17.5 mV) or rofecoxib (19.2 mV) than without the inhibitors (29.1 and 29.3 mV, respectively). Depolarization of V(o), by a decrease in tear Cl- from 81 to 8.1 mM, was abolished by the COX inhibitors. Decrease in I(sc) and V(o) can be explained by a decrease in the K+ and Cl-? conductances.

The impact of these biologically active compounds on ecosystems is hard to predict, and information on their biodegradation is necessary to establish sound risk assessment. Microbial communities are promising candidates for the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, but little is known yet about their degradation capacity of multiple micropollutants at higher concentrations (100 mg/L). In this work, microbial communities were cultivated in lab-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) exposed to increasing concentrations of a mixture of six micropollutants (ibuprofen, diclofenac, enalapril, caffeine, atenolol, paracetamol). Key players of biodegradation were identified using a combinatorial approach of 16S rRNA sequencing and analytics. Microbial community structure changed with increasing pharmaceutical intake (from 1 to 100 mg/L) and reached a steady-state during incubation for 7 weeks on 100 mg/L. HPLC analysis revealed a fluctuating but significant degradation (30-100%) of five pollutants (caffeine, paracetamol, ibuprofen, atenolol, enalapril) by an established and stable microbial community mainly composed of Achromobacter, Cupriavidus, Pseudomonas and Leucobacter. By using the microbial community from MBR1 as inoculum for further batch culture experiments on single micropollutants (400 mg/L substrate, respectively), different active microbial consortia were obtained for each single micropollutant. Microbial genera potentially responsible for degradation of the respective micropollutant were identified, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. and Sphingobacterium sp. for ibuprofen, caffeine and paracetamol, Sphingomonas sp. for atenolol and Klebsiella sp. for enalapril. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of cultivating stable microbial communities capable of degrading simultaneously a mixture of highly concentrated pharmaceuticals in lab-scale MBRs and the identification of microbial genera potentially responsible for the degradation of specific pollutants.

CF-related CRS treatment is extremely challenging because of the underlying genetic defect leading to its development. CRS in CF is often refractory to standard therapy, while recurrences after surgical treatment are inevitable in the majority of patients. This study provides a precise review of the current knowledge regarding possible therapeutic options for CF-related CRS.<h4>Methods</h4>The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms ""cystic fibrosis"" in conjunction with ""otorhinolaryngological manifestation"", ""rhinology"" and ""sinusitis"".<h4>Results</h4>Precise guidelines for CF-induced CRS therapy are lacking due to the lack of large cohort randomized controlled trials. None of the existing therapeutic agents has already been recommended for CRS in CF. Therapy targeting the underlying genetic defect, intranasal dornase alfa administration, and topical delivery of colistin and tobramycin showed promising results in CF-related CRS therapy. Besides the potential effectiveness of nasal steroids, strong recommendations for their usage in CF have not been provided yet. Systemic corticosteroid usage is controversial due to its potential negative influence on pulmonary disease. Ibuprofen revealed some positive effects on CF-related CRS in molecular and small cohort studies. Intranasal irrigation with saline solutions could relieve sinonasal symptoms. Nasal decongestants are not recommended. Endoscopic sinus surgery is the first-line surgical option for refractory CRS. Extensive surgical approaches should be considered as they could improve long-term outcomes in CRS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Further studies are warranted to establish consensus for CF-related CRS therapy.",2022,,"Krajewska J, Zub K, Słowikowski A, Zatoński T.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-021-06875-6,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Dosing and administration of ibuprofen', 'Specific study results related to ibuprofen']",The paper discusses ibuprofen's effects on CF-related CRS but lacks detailed formulation and measured endpoints.

Eight healthy, recreationally active males ingested 800 mg Ibuprofen or a placebo ~ 1 h prior to performing fixed RPE cycling for 60 min in 35 °C and 60% relative humidity at an intensity of hard to very hard (RPE = 16) with intermittent maximal (RPE = 20) sprints every 10 min.

These SCFAs supply energy, suppress cancer, and affect ion transport. However, their roles in ion transport and regulation in the intracellular environment remain unknown. In order to elucidate the roles of SCFAs, we measured short-circuit currents (I<sub>SC</sub>) and performed RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses of ion transporters in rat rectal colon. The application of 30 mM butyrate shifted I<sub>SC</sub> in a negative direction, but did not attenuate the activity of epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels (ENaC).

The objectives of this study are to describe the current pediatric procedural sedation and analgesia practice patterns in European emergency departments, to perform a needs assessment-like analysis, and to identify barriers to implementation. A survey study of European emergency departments treating children was conducted. Through a lead research coordinator identified through the Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine (REPEM) network for each of the participating countries, a 30-question questionnaire was sent, targeting senior physicians at each site. Descriptive statistics were performed. One hundred and seventy-one sites participated, treating approximately 5 million children/year and representing 19 countries, with a response rate of 89%. Of the procedural sedation and analgesia medications, midazolam (100%) and ketamine (91%) were available to most children, whereas propofol (67%), nitrous oxide (56%), intranasal fentanyl (47%), and chloral hydrate (42%) were less frequent. Children were sedated by general pediatricians in 82% of cases. Safety and monitoring guidelines were common (74%), but pre-procedural checklists (51%) and capnography (46%) less available. In 37% of the sites, the entire staff performing procedural sedation and analgesia were certified in pediatric advanced life support. Pediatric emergency medicine was a board-certified specialty in 3/19 countries. Physician (73%) and nursing (72%) shortages and lack of physical space (69%) were commonly reported as barriers to procedural sedation and analgesia. Nurse-directed triage protocols were in place in 52% of the sites, mostly for paracetamol (99%) and ibuprofen (91%). Tissue adhesive for laceration repair was available to 91% of children, while topical anesthetics for intravenous catheterization was available to 55%. Access to child life specialists (13%) and hypnosis (12%) was rare.Conclusion: Procedural sedation and analgesia are prevalent in European emergency departments, but some sedation agents and topical anesthetics are not widely available. Guidelines are common but further safety nets, nurse-directed triage analgesia, and nonpharmacologic support to procedural sedation and analgesia are lacking. Barriers to implementation include availability of sedation agents, staff shortage, and lack of space. What is Known: • Effective and prompt analgesia, anxiolysis, and sedation (PSA) outside the operating theatre have become standard in managing pain and anxiety in children undergoing painful or anxiogenic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. • We searched PubMed up to September 15, 2020, without any date limits or language restrictions, using different combinations of the MeSH terms ""pediatrics,"" ""hypnotics and sedatives,"" ""conscious sedation,"" and ""ambulatory surgical procedures"" and the non-MeSH term ""procedural sedation"" and found no reports describing the current practice of pediatric PSA in Europe. What is New: • This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to shed light on the pediatric PSA practice in European EDs and uncovers important gaps in several domains, notably availability of sedation medications and topical anesthetics, safety aspects such as PSA provider training, availability of nonpharmacologic support to PSA, and high impact interventions such as nurse-directed triage analgesia. • Other identified barriers to PSA implementation include staff shortage, control of sedation medications by specialists outside the emergency department, and lack of space.",2021,,"Sahyoun C, Cantais A, Gervaix A, Bressan S, Löllgen R, Krauss B, Pediatric Emergency Medicine Comfort and Analgesia Research in Europe (PemCARE) group of the Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-021-03930-6,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specifics on ibuprofen permeation', 'Data on diffusion cell methods']","The study focuses on pediatric sedation practices and does not provide relevant information regarding ibuprofen in vitro permeation or release.

In addition, preoperative administration of ibuprofen has proved to reduce interleukin-6 (IL-6) release, while that of ranitidine reduced postoperative IL-6-induced C-reactive protein synthesis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. However, it has not been established whether the preoperative administration of both types of drugs may reduced the postoperative inflammatory reaction after instrumented spinal surgery. Accordingly, our objective was to investigate the effects of preoperative treatment with naproxen plus famotidine on the postoperative systemic inflammatory reaction in patients undergoing instrumented lumbar spinal surgery. Forty consecutive patients scheduled for elective instrumented spinal fusion were alternately assigned to receive either naproxen (500 mg/day, p.o.) plus famotidine (40 mg/day, p.o.) for 7 days before operation, or no adjuvant treatment. Haematological parameters, acute phase proteins, complement fractions, immunoglobulins and cytokines were determined 7 days and immediately before surgery, and on days 0, 1, 2 and 7 after surgery. Haematological parameters, clinical data, duration of surgery, blood loss, perioperative blood transfusion and postoperative complications were similar in the two groups, although pretreated patients showed lower increases in body temperature and required less analgesic medication. Compared with preoperative levels, IL-6 levels were significantly increased postoperatively in all patients with no differences between groups. C-reactive protein, alpha(1)-acid-glycoprotein and haptoglobin levels were also significantly increased postoperatively in all patients; however, they were significantly lower in pretreated patients. In conclusion, perioperative treatment with naproxen plus famotidine was well tolerated and reduced the acute phase response after instrumented spinal surgery.

The Ib moiety is an enhancer of KTP-NH2 analgesic action. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that KTP-NH2 is an enhancer of the Ib anti-inflammatory action. Moreover, the impact of the IbKTP-NH2 conjugation on microcirculation was also evaluated by a unified approach based on intravital microscopy in the murine cremasteric muscle. Our data show that KTP-NH2 and conjugates do not cause damage on microcirculatory environment and efficiently decrease the number of leukocyte rolling induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the drugs bind to LPS directly thus contributing to LPS aggregation and subsequent elimination. In a parallel study, molecular dynamics simulations and NMR data showed that the IbKTP-NH2 tandem adopts a preferential ""stretched"" conformation in lipid bilayers and micelles, with the simulations indicating that the Ib moiety is anchored in the hydrophobic core, which explains the improved partition of IbKTP-NH2 to membranes and the permeability of lipid bilayers to this conjugate relative to KTP-NH2. The ability to bind glycolipids concomitant to the anchoring in the lipid membranes through the Ib residue explains the analgesic potency of IbKTP-NH2 given the enriched glycocalyx of the blood-brain barrier cells.

It is associated with progressive histological alterations and disabling symptoms. Today, drugs such as glucocorticoids (GCs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSIADs) are commonly employed for treatment of osteoarthritis, but have serious and life-threatening side effects. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effects of escin on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, isoform), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-18 (IL-18), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and nitric oxide (NO) (1), as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on inflammatory cells, similar osteoarthritis in synoviocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, and to compare it with dexamethasone (DEX) and ibuprofen (IBP). Synovial cells were isolated from synovial membrane of the radiocarpal joint cartilage of an 8-month-old Holstein cow. THP-1 cells were prepared from Pasteur Institute of Iran. Cells were cultivated and exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation without, or in the presence of, DEX, IBP, or escin. The gene expressions of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-18, COX-2, and iNOS were evaluated by real-time PCR. Concentrations of NO and PGE2 were measured by ELISA methods. Our cells secreted an increased amounts of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-18, COX-2, iNOS, NO, and PGE2 in response to LPS stimulation in all conditions. Escin can quench the gene expression of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α in synoviocyte cells and production of NO and PGE2 in monocyte/macrophage cells alike DEX and IBP.

The edema was produced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This response was maximal within 2 h and disappeared after 24 h The minimum edema-forming dose was estimated at 0.8 μg/20 g body weight. Microscopic examination confirmed that VLV also induces skin structure alterations with collagen fiber dissociation and polynuclear infiltration, which is characteristic of edema formation. The induced edema with VLV (1 μg/paw) could be due to the release of pharmacological active substances at the site of injection. Histamine, serotonine, and arachidonate metabolites may play important roles in the vasoactive and edematic effect of VLV since pretreatment of mice with cromoglycate, cyproheptadine, ibuprofen, loratidine, and indomethacin significantly reduced the edema formation (77, 63, 57, 45, and 43 %, respectively). The obtained results demonstrate that the induced edema and vasodilatation by this venom may be triggered and maintained by different pharmacological mechanisms, since cromoglycate and cyproheptadine were the most active inhibitors of the edema.

Despite growing knowledge of the nature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), treatment options are still poorly defined. The safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically ibuprofen, has been openly questioned without any supporting evidence or clarity over dose, duration, or temporality of administration. This has been further conflicted by the initiation of studies to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen in improving outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients. To clarify the scientific reality, a literature search was conducted alongside considerations of the pharmacological properties of ibuprofen in order to construct this narrative review. The literature suggests that double-blind, placebo-controlled study results must be reported and carefully analysed for safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19 before any recommendations can be made regarding the use of ibuprofen in such patients. Limited studies have suggested: (i) no direct interactions between ibuprofen and SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) there is no evidence to suggest ibuprofen affects the regulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for COVID-19, in human studies. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest ibuprofen may facilitate cleavage of ACE2 from the membrane, preventing membrane-dependent viral entry into the cell, the clinical significance of which is uncertain. Additionally, in vitro evidence suggests that inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) by ibuprofen may have a role in reducing excess inflammation or cytokine release in COVID-19 patients.

A feature common to both these adverse events is a variety of vascular reactions. One approach to overcome these side effects has been the development of nitric-oxide (NO)-donating NSAIDs. The NO is considered to overcome some of these vascular reactions caused by NSAIDs. Unfortunately, the NO-NSAIDs developed so far have not had the expected benefits compared with NSAIDs alone.<h4>Objectives</h4>Using in vitro preparations it is hoped to gain insight into the vascular and smooth muscle reactions induced by NO-NSAIDs compared with NSAIDs as a basis for improving the protective responses attributed to the NO-donating properties of these drugs.<h4>Methods</h4>A range of NO-NSAIDs was synthesized based on the esterification of NSAIDs with the nitro-butoxylate as a prototype of an NO-donor. These compounds, as well as NO-donor agents and NSAIDS, were examined for their possible effects on isolated segments of digital arteries of fallow deer, which provide a robust model for determining the effects of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor activities, in comparison with those of standard pharmacological agents.<h4>Results</h4>The NO-NSAIDs were found to antagonise the smooth muscle contractions produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT). However, while almost all their parent NSAIDs had little or no effect, with the exception of the R-(-)-isomers of both ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, which caused vasodilatation, all the NO-NSAIDs tested antagonised the increase in tension produced by 5-HT.<h4>Conclusions</h4>R-(-)-ibuprofen and R-(-)-flurbiprofen, along with the nitro-butoxyl esters of the NSAIDs examined, produce relaxation of segments of deer digital artery smooth muscle in vitro. The evidence presented suggests that their mechanism involves the release of NO or its products.",2021,,"Callingham BA, Khan MA, Milton AS, Rainsford KD.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-021-00858-z,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,yes,uncertain,uncertain,no,uncertain,"['Details on methodology related to ibuprofen diffusion', 'Endpoints measured in the study', 'Formulation specifics of the NO-NSAIDs and ibuprofen']","The study involves ibuprofen but focuses primarily on its effects on arterial smooth muscle, not specifically on permeation or release mechanisms relevant to diffusion cells.",0.5

(Arecaceae family), a palm species known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, attributed to bioactive constituents that may facilitate wound healing and enhance dermatological health. However, the wound-healing efficacy of Veitchia arecina remains uninvestigated. This study is the first to evaluate the chemical composition, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, dermal safety, and wound-healing potential of Veitchia arecina leaf fractions in a rat model. The study aimed to elucidate their mechanism of action in tissue regeneration. The chemical composition of light petroleum ether and n-butanol soluble fractions of Veitchia arecina was analyzed via gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC-MS) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), respectively. In-vitro antioxidant (DPPH), anti-inflammatory (COX-1), and MTT assays were performed utilizing a 5% gel formulation, with povidone-iodine serving as the standard. The phytochemical analysis of the tested fractions using GLC-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS revealed the presence of sterols, terpenes, vitamin E isomers, and fatty acids in light petroleum ether soluble fraction as well as flavonoid glycosides and phenolics in n-butanol soluble fraction. Both fractions showed significant antioxidant and COX-1 inhibitory activities comparable to Trolox and ibuprofen. The topical gel formulations exhibited no dermal toxicity while improving healing by attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress, enhancing blood vessel formation, re-epithelization, formation of collagen, and restoring skin architecture.

The strong bonding results from Michael type addition reaction between an acrylate end group on a polymer and the sulfide end group of the mucin type glycoprotein. A proof of concept is provided using a polyehtylene glycol hydrogel formed in situ from polyehtylene glycol di-acrylate (PEG-DA) macromers. The ability of PEG-DA to create interactions with mucin type glycoproteins was verified using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and rheology experiments. NMR studies have detected disappearance of the PEG-DA's vinyl protons upon mucin addition, whereas rheology measurements have shown a viscosity increase. These results provide an evidence for the formation of mucin-polymer covalent bond. The ability PEG-DA to attach to mucus and promote mucoadhesion was evaluated by tensile measurements.

These fibrous mats were fabricated via electrospinning of cellulose acetate/poly(vinylpyrrolidone) composites in a binary solvent of N,N-dimethyl acetamide/acetone. Physical status studies suggested that Drug-in-fiber could inhibit IBU re-crystallization, but the active ingredients were released at a relatively slow rate due to the dual-resistance of fiber mat and adhesive matrix. To overcome this shortcoming, Drug-in-adhesive/fiber was designed by coupling medicated hydrophilic pressure sensitive adhesive and IBU-loaded fiber mat.

Drug-polymer conjugates were characterized using 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Stability of the drug-conjugates was studied using free drug release through a dialysis membrane. Cellular entry of FITC-labeled HBP conjugates was studied using fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and cell supernatant was analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometer. The intracellular localization of FITC-labeled conjugates in A549 lung epithelial cells was imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Anti-inflammatory activity of the HBP-ibuprofen conjugates was estimated in vitro by measuring the concentration of prostaglandin (PGE2) using an ELISA kit.<h4>Results</h4>The average number of ibuprofen molecules conjugated per molecule of HBP was estimated to be 50 for polyol and 53 for polyglycerol. The HBP-drug conjugates did not release the drug up to 72 h in methanol, indicating the presence of stable ester bonds. Both the polymer-drug conjugates entered the cells rapidly. The conjugates were localized in the cell cytosol as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy. Within 30 min, the HBP-drug conjugates showed rapid suppression of PGE2 synthesis, whereas free ibuprofen did not show any activity. At later times, the conjugates showed comparable activity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>For the first time, we report HBP conjugates with a high drug payload.

However, this process can introduce pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and their metabolites, posing environmental risks. This study investigates the transport behavior of four selected PhACs-caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and ibuprofen-under neutral pH conditions using column experiments in both unsaturated and saturated porous media. PhACs and a tracer solution were introduced into the system, and experimental results were simulated using the CXTFIT model to determine retardation and degradation factors. Experimental findings indicate high mobility for carbamazepine and ibuprofen across both unsaturated and saturated conditions with high recovery (> 88%) and negligible degradation (< 0.05). Ibuprofen behaved similarly identical to the tracer in unsaturated medium and with small adsorption/desorption in saturation with a retardation factor of ~ 1, while carbamazepine showed slight retardation and tailing effects showing higher persistence in the water, with high dispersion in unsaturated medium. Diclofenac significantly degrades in saturated media (45% recovery) but increases release under unsaturated conditions (91% recovery). This indicates the release of diclofenac through the vadose zone but can undergo degradation and retardation in aquifers. Caffeine exhibited high retardation and degradation, with a low recovery rate (27-30%) under both conditions, suggesting that degradation or irreversible adsorption may have occurred independently of moisture content during transport. This finding highlights the differences in mobility and degradation across unsaturated and saturated zones, posing long-term contamination risks of PhACs.

Dissolution and permeation studies performed utilizing diffusion cells and subsequently HPLC validated methods were employed to determine the API content in the acceptor solution. Accelerated stability studies were also performed at 40 °C and 70% relative humidity. The adhesive performance of the fabricated patch was evaluated utilizing loop tack adhesion tests.<h4>Results</h4>In vitro permeation experiments across both Strat-M® and human skin demonstrated that ibuprofen can easily be released from the adhesive matrix and penetrate through the studied membrane. A comparison on the permeation rates of the API across the two membranes indicated that there is not a strong correlation between the obtained data. The presence of chemical enhancers facilitated an increased flux of the API higher than observed in the basic formulation. Initial stability studies of the optimized formulation showed no degradation with respect to the drug content. Adhesion studies were also performed indicating higher values when compared with commercially available products.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study demonstrated the fabrication of an ibuprofen patch utilizing a versatile, solvent-free drug delivery platform. Upon optimization of the final system, the resulting patch offers many advantages compared to commercially available formulations including high drug loading (up to 25 wt%), good adhesion, and painless removal leaving no residues on the skin. This PSA offers many advantages over existing adhesive technology.

The aim of this study was to investigate in a systematic way whether miconazole nitrate can have skin penetration enhancing properties. Using Franz diffusion cells, three representative model compounds (caffeine, testosterone and ibuprofen) were applied to human skin as 10 mM aqueous-ethanolic solutions with or without 1 mM of miconazole nitrate. The apparent permeability coefficient K(p) for each of the model compounds was determined with and without miconazole nitrate. While a statistically significant penetration enhancement effect of 33% was found for testosterone, no overall statistically significant effect could be demonstrated for caffeine and ibuprofen. The increase in skin permeability of testosterone is mainly due to an improved partitioning from the dose solution into the skin, thereby resulting in a higher delivery through the human skin.

The use of non-prescription analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs (AAIDs), especially paracetamol, is higher compared to pre-pandemic. This increased the AAIDs load discharged to the aqueous media through sewerage treatment plant (STP). Therefore, simple and effective treatment options for removing AAIDs from STP effluents are needed. The aim of the study was to remove AAIDs (paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, codeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, naproxen, and phenylbutazone) from STP effluents by nearly pure natural clay Na-montmorillonite. The Na-montmorillonite taken from the Ordu region in the northern part of Turkey. Surface area of the Na-montmorillonite is 99.58 m<sup>2</sup>/g and CEC is 92.40 meq/100 g. The removal efficiencies of AAIDs using Na-montmorillonite were between 82 ± 5% (ibuprofen) and 94 ± 4% (naproxen). Paracetamol was used as a model compound in kinetic and isotherm model studies. Freundlich isotherm model and the pseudo second order kinetic model were the best-fit using the obtained experimental data. Film diffusion governed its rate mechanism. The paracetamol adsorption capacity was acquired as 244 mg/g at 120 min contact time at pH 6.5 at 25 °C. With this study, it could be shown that montmorillonite can be used effectively to eliminate paracetamol from STP effluent. Natural clay can be used as a simple, inexpensive and effective adsorbent for removing AAIDs from STP effluents.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13201-023-01930-5.",2023,,"Aydin S, Celik Karakaya M, Karakaya N, Aydin ME.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-023-01930-5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology for ibuprofen removal', 'Condition parameters for removal experiments', 'Analysis of permeation rates or mechanisms used']","The study discusses the removal of ibuprofen from wastewater using natural clay but does not focus on permeation or release using Franz diffusion cells.

Microneedles (MN) made from dissolving polymeric matrices and loaded with the model drugs ovalbumin (OVA) and ibuprofen sodium and hydrogel-forming MN composed of ""super-swelling"" polymers and their corresponding lyophilised wafer drug reservoirs loaded with OVA and ibuprofen sodium were prepared aseptically or sterilised using commonly employed sterilisation techniques. Moist and dry heat sterilisation, understandably, damaged all devices, leaving aseptic production and gamma sterilisation as the only viable options. No measureable bioburden was detected in any of the prepared devices, and endotoxin levels were always below the US Food & Drug Administration limits (20 endotoxin units/device). Hydrogel-forming MN were unaffected by gamma irradiation (25 kGy) in terms of their physical properties or capabilities in delivering OVA and ibuprofen sodium across excised neonatal porcine skin in vitro. However, OVA content in dissolving MN (down from approximately 101.1 % recovery to approximately 58.3 % recovery) and lyophilised wafer-type drug reservoirs (down from approximately 99.7 % recovery to approximately 60.1 % recovery) was significantly reduced by gamma irradiation, while the skin permeation profile of ibuprofen sodium from gamma-irradiated dissolving MN was markedly different from their non-irradiated counterparts. It is clear that MN poses a very low risk to human health when used appropriately, as evidenced here by low endotoxin levels and absence of microbial contamination. However, if guarantees of absolute sterility of MN products are ultimately required by regulatory authorities, it will be necessary to investigate the effect of lower gamma doses on dissolving MN loaded with active pharmaceutical ingredients and lyophilised wafers loaded with biomolecules in order to avoid the expense and inconvenience of aseptic processing.",2015,,"McCrudden MT, Alkilani AZ, Courtenay AJ, McCrudden CM, McCloskey B, Walker C, Alshraiedeh N, Lutton RE, Gilmore BF, Woolfson AD, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13346-014-0211-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed results on permeation rates of ibuprofen sodium', 'Comparison of different formulations', 'Impact of sterilization methods on drug delivery efficacy']","The study involves ibuprofen sodium and in vitro skin permeation, making it relevant for the dataset.

Drug-loaded Soluplus<sup>®</sup> micelles with a mean size around 60-70 nm were prepared by two methods (direct dissolution or film hydration method). The prepared nanosystems were characterized in terms of mean particle size and Zeta potential, physical stability, drug solubility, and in vitro drug release. The solubility of the tested APIs was shown to increase linearly with the concentration of graft copolymer. Soluplus<sup>®</sup> can be easily submitted to membrane filtration (0.2 µm PES or PTFE membranes), showing the potential to be sterilized by this method.

Also, lacosamide reacts with collapsin-response mediator protein 2, preventing its phosphorylation and leading to the inhibition of CGRP release in the trigeminal system.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary outcome was the difference in the serum level of CGRP-LI after three months of treatment with either lacosamide and ibuprofen or ibuprofen alone in episodic migraine patients. The secondary outcomes were assessing safety and efficacy of lacosamide in episodic migraine patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial on episodic migraine patients aged 10-55 years diagnosed according to (ICHD-3) in Kafr El-Sheikh University Hospital, Egypt. We assessed serum levels of CGRP-LI before and three months after treatment in our two groups, the lacosamide, and the control groups. We also assessed the side effects of treatment in each group, the percentage of patients who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in the migraine monthly days (MMD) frequency and the percentage of patients who achieved pain freedom within 2 h in ≥ 4 of 5 attacks in each group.<h4>Results</h4>200 episodic migraine patients completed the study. There was a statistically significantly higher reduction in the serum CGRP-LI level in the lacosamide group compared with the control group. In addition, lacosamide was well tolerated by patients. Also, the lacosamide group had statistically significant higher percentage of patients who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in the migraine monthly days (MMD) frequency and pain freedom within two hours in ≥ 4 of 5 attacks with P-values 0.002, 0.02 respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The daily use of lacosamide 50 mg Bid for three months in episodic migraine patients was associated with a significant reduction in serum CGRP-LI, better clinical outcomes regarding frequency and duration of migraine attacks, and was well tolerated by patients.

Internal discolourations are due to the properties of the restorative materials. External discolourations can be associated with frequent consumption of food and beverages and the use of suspensions or syrups containing colourants/additives. Fluoride varnish application has an important place in preventive dentistry. The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of fluoride varnish application on the colour change on polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials caused by the use of various paediatric drugs.<h4>Methods</h4>Two hundred ten discs were prepared from polyacid-modified composite resin material and divided into two groups: flouride varnish was applied to one group and flouride varnish was not applied to the other group. The groups were further divided into seven subgroups and the samples were kept in artificial saliva, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, clarithromycin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and iron supplement drug solutions. The colour change values of the discs were measured using a spectrophotometer device before immersion in the drug solutions and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days after the immersion. The obtained data were calculated and statistically evaluated using IBM SPSS V23 software.<h4>Results</h4>It was found that the application of fluoride varnish in the iron supplement drug group prevented the colour change of the polyacid-modified composite resins for 28 days. In the amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and paracetamol groups, the fluoride varnish did not prevent colour change in the polyacid-modified composite resin restorative materials at the end of the 14th day.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is thought that fluoride varnish application may be beneficial as a preservative in the colour change of polyacid-modified composite resins due to the use of various paediatric drugs, and this protective feature may be effective for a specific period of time.",2024,,"Çevik N, Hazar Bodrumlu E.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40368-024-00894-7,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['details on ibuprofen use', 'measurable endpoints related to ibuprofen', 'formulation specifics if mentioned']","This study focuses on the color change in composite resin due to pediatric drug use, including ibuprofen, but does not align directly with ibuprofen permeation or release studies that utilize Franz diffusion cells.",0.7

Immunological system activation was shown to accelerate kidney damage even in inherited disorders. The kynurenine pathway is the main route of tryptophan degradation. A metabolite of kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), produced by kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), was reported to affect fluid and electrolyte balance as a result of natriuresis induction. The accumulation of KYNA was shown in patients with impaired kidney function and its level was related to the degree of kidney damage. Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are well-known analgesics and most of them demonstrate an anti-inflammatory effect. Their main mechanism of action is prostaglandin synthesis blockade, which is also responsible for their nephrotoxic potential. Since the KYN pathway is known to remain under immunological system control, the purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of 9 COX inhibitors on KYNA production together with KATs' activity in rat kidneys in vitro.<h4>Methods</h4>Experiments were carried out on kidney homogenates in the presence of L-KYN and the selected compound in 6 various concentrations.<h4>Results</h4>Among the examined COX inhibitors only acetaminophen did not change KYNA production in rat kidneys in vitro. Additionally, acetaminophen did not affect the activity of KAT I and KAT II, whereas acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen inhibited only KAT II.

A molecular mechanism distinct from that of alpha 2-adrenergic agonists.,"To evaluate the regulation and effects of pancreatic islet lipoxygenase, adult rat islets were permeabilized, using digitonin or staphylococcal alpha-toxin, and then were studied in a medium simulating an intracellular milieu at fixed ambient concentrations of Ca2+. Permeabilized islets retained 12-lipoxygenase activity, as indicated by conversion of tritiated arachidonic acid to a predominant peak of [3H]12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE); this activity was inhibited (89-98%) by the lipoxygenase blockers nordihydroguaiaretic acid (35 microM), BW755c (250 microM) or ETYA (35 microM). Lesser amounts of compounds coeluting with 15- and 11-HETE (but little or no 5-HETE) were formed; however, 11-HETE (and possibly some 15-HETE) was probably synthesized (at least in part) via cyclooxygenase, as suggested by the partial synthesis blockade induced by 50 microM ibuprofen. The production of 12-HETE did not require the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+ or ATP; it also was not stimulated by addition of cyclic AMP, a phorbol ester, or calmodulin. However, it was augmented modestly by provision of a basal cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration of 60-80 nM, with no further increase at physiologically elevated levels of 260-530 nM. Elevations in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations induced insulin release which was inhibited by cooling, epinephrine or protein kinase inhibitors and, therefore, was exocytotic in nature. Lipoxygenase inhibitors blocked this insulinotropic effect of calcium at submaximal or saturating Ca2+ concentrations (with or without its potentiation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C) by 53-82%. However, they did not reduce the Ca2+-independent secretory effects (at subnanomolar Ca2+ concentrations) of the phorbol ester alone. Similar results were seen using dibutyryl cyclic AMP to activate protein kinase A. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonists epinephrine or clonidine inhibited Ca2+-, TPA- or cyclic AMP-induced insulin release without reducing HETE formation. We conclude that (1) islet lipoxygenase is constitutively expressed and is not physiologically regulated by alpha 2-adrenergic agonism, Ca2+ or protein kinases; (2) lipoxygenase modulates insulin release; HETE production is not merely an epiphenomenon reflecting the activation (or inhibition) of exocytotic secretion; (3) islet lipoxygenase inhibitors reduce insulin secretion, at least in part, by blocking the direct effects of Ca2+ on exocytosis and/or its synergism with Ca2+-binding proteins such as protein kinase C; and (4) these same inhibitors do not directly poison protein kinase C or A, or the exocytotic apparatus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1989,,Metz SA.,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(89)90421-8,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"[""Details on ibuprofen's formulation"", 'Specific endpoints related to ibuprofen permeation', 'Relevance to in vitro release studies']",The study focuses on lipoxygenase activity and insulin secretion rather than on ibuprofen's permeation or release using Franz cells.

Relaxation in response to BK seems due to a direct action on the longitudinal smooth muscle since effects were demonstrable in the presence of ibuprofen, mepyramine, atropine, guanethidine (all 1 microM), hexamethonium (10 microM) and TTX (0.3 microM). Receptors involved are of the B2 subtype since agonists and antagonists active at B1 receptors were essentially inactive, and the B2 receptor antagonist Lys,Lys-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK was a potent competitive antagonist of BK-induced relaxation (pKB of 7.2 +/- 0.1). The activity of both BK and the antagonist were unchanged by the presence of peptidase inhibitors including the carboxypeptidase inhibitor DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (mergetpa, 10 microM), which prevents conversion of BK analogues to des-Arg9-B1-active products. In high-K+ solution, BK (0.1-10 microM) produced concentration-related increases in 86Rb efflux. Both this permeability increase in high-K+ solution, and the relaxant responses in Krebs solution, were inhibited by low concentrations (10-100 nM) of apamin, as well as the B2 receptor antagonist Lys,Lys-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK (1 microM). These results are compatable with the proposal that BK-evoked relaxation of the rat duodenum is mediated via a subset of B2 receptors for which the antagonist Lys,Lys-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK has a high affinity, and results from stabilisation of the smooth muscle membrane through the opening of apamin-sensitive 86Rb-permeable calcium-activated K+ channels.",1991,,"Hall JM, Morton IK.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(91)90041-n,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Experimental methods for permeation measurements', ""Endpoints related to ibuprofen's effect on permeability"", 'Presence of Franz diffusion cell methodology', 'Details on formulations used in experiments']","The study focuses on bradykinin's effect on smooth muscle in the rat duodenum, and while it mentions ibuprofen, it does not seem to directly address ibuprofen permeation or release mechanisms relevant to diffusion cells.",0.5

The magnitude of the testosterone response to AA was similar to that observed when ovarian follicles were incubated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Ovarian follicles incubated with AA and either hCG or forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator) produced more testosterone than follicles incubated with either of these compounds alone. The actions of AA on testosterone production were completely blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin or ibuprofen) and were reduced by 50% by the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Phospholipase C was far more effective than phospholipase A2 in the stimulation of testosterone production.

This is presumably a protective mechanism which may be blocked by the use of H1 and H2 antagonists. Mesenteric arterioles of 29 rats were observed with intravital microscopy. Diameter and erythrocyte velocity were measured and arteriolar flow was calculated. Histamine was topically applied to the vessels under view in sequentially increasing concentrations (10(-7) to 10(-4) M). Following systemic injection of an H1 or H2 receptor antagonist or ibuprofen, the application of 10(-4) M histamine was repeated.

PGD2 depressed neurotransmission throughout a broad range of stimulus free quencies, apparently by presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine release. PGE2 enhanced the effects of both nerve stimulation and exogenous norepinephrine in intact preparations but only depressed the effects of exogenous norepinephrine in the chronically denervated nictitating membrane, suggesting that part of the effect of PGE2 on neurotransmission was presynaptic. When norepinephrine reuptake was blocked by desipramine, PGE2 still enhanced neurotransmission. Indomethacin, but not other cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, meclofenamic acid), inhibited the response of the nictitating membrane to nerve stimulation without depressing the effects of exogenous norepinephine. Curiously, indomethacin, but again not other cyclooxygenase inhibitors, specifically antagonized the ability of PGE2 to enhance nerve transmission. These results further characterize the pharmacological effects of PGE2 and PGD2 at the nictitating membrane. The lack of effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests that neither endogenous PGE2 or PGD2 play a functional role at this synapse.

Inhibition of granule exocytosis and oxygen radical generation at ibuprofen concentrations less than 5 mg/ml was not due to drug cytotoxicity since release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase was not affected by ibuprofen. In contrast to neutrophil responses mediated by C5a or FMLP, ibuprofen did not inhibit either enzyme release or superoxide anion generation by neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. Ibuprofen did not function as an oxygen radical scavenger in a cell-free system in which superoxide anion was generated by the aerobic action of xanthine oxidase on hypoxanthine. Ibuprofen also inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion both directed migration (chemotaxis) and stimulated random migration (chemokinesis) of neutrophils exposed to either FMLP or C5a. Inhibition of neutrophil adherence to plastic surfaces and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells was equally effective when the neutrophils were treated with ibuprofen before stimulation with FMLP or phorbol myristate acetate. The inhibitory effects of ibuprofen pretreatment of neutrophils could not be overcome by addition of prostaglandins E1 or E2 (0.3-300 nM). These results demonstrate that ibuprofen is capable of suppressing many functions thought to be important in neutrophil-mediated acute pulmonary inflammatory processes.

Once activated, the suppressor cells inhibit the in vitro antibody synthesis of cocultured syngeneic splenocytes stimulated by T cell dependent antigens. In this paper we have examined the possibility that prostaglandins are involved in the activation process. Inducer and precursor cells were cultured in Marbrook vessels in chambers separated by dialysis membranes. Using this procedure, suppressor cells were activated following 12 h of culture but were not detectable after 6 h. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin, acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), and ibuprofen all prevented the activation of suppressor cells in a dose dependent manner. Prostaglandin (PG) E1, but not PGF2a or PGD2, restored the activation of suppressor cells in cultures containing the cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Restoration of suppressor cell activation was seen with 1 X 10(-7) M PGE1 but no activation of suppressor cells was seen in control cultures containing up to 1 X 10(-5) M PGE1. In addition, cultured spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice did not secrete higher quantities of PGE than did cells from age and sex matched normal mice. These data suggest that PGE has a modulatory rather than a direct role in the activation of suppressor cells by inducer factors from tumor-activated inducer cells.",1986,,"Pillay DJ, Karmazyn M, Pope BL.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0192-0561(86)90063-9,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific permeation/release data', 'Comparison of measured endpoints']","The study involves ibuprofen and its effects in a biological system, but it does not directly address in vitro permeation or diffusion cells relevant to the dataset being built.",0.7

Dependence in arachidonic acid, phospholipase A2, calcium availability and membrane depolarization.","Isolated hippocampal mossy fiber synaptosomes were used to characterize control mechanisms of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) synthesis at a central mammalian synapse. Exogenous arachidonic acid stimulated the dose-dependent synthesis of PGF2 alpha, as did the addition of phospholipase A2 or the activation of endogenous phospholipase A2. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors attenuated prostaglandin synthesis, but phospholipase C inhibitors had no effect. However, a diglyceride kinase inhibitor reduced PGF2 alpha accumulation. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen eliminated PGF2 alpha production, while the lipoxygenase inhibitors baicalein and NDGA reduced PGF2 alpha accumulation. The CA(2+)-ionophore-dependent stimulation of PGF2 alpha synthesis was abolished by Cd2+ or Ni2+. Further more, PGF2 alpha production appeared to be dependent on Ca2+ influx via L-type, but not N- or T-type, voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Membrane depolarization with KC1, veratridine or 4-aminopyridine stimulated the synthesis of PGF2 alpha. This depolarization-dependent stimulation of PGF2 alpha synthesis was attenuated by L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel blockers, phospholipase A2 inhibitors, a K+ channel activator and a Na+ channel blocker. The activation of protein kinase C also led to a reduction of PGF2 alpha accumulation in depolarized nerve endings. These results may be used to suggest that PGF2 alpha production by hippocampal mossy fiber synaptosomes was controlled by the Ca(2+)- and phospholipase A2-dependent accumulation of unesterified arachidonic acid and was modulated by membrane depolarization and the activity of protein kinase C.",1993,,"Separovic D, Dorman RV.",https://doi.org/10.1016/0952-3278(93)90100-b,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"[""Potential mention of ibuprofen's formulation"", 'Details on experiment methodology for permeation studies']","The study focuses on PGF2 alpha synthesis and mechanisms involving calcium and phospholipase A2, with ibuprofen as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, but does not specifically address in vitro permeation or diffusion cell methodologies.",0.7

The stereoscopic and internal structures of ibuprofen microspheres were quantitatively analyzed by synchrotron radiation X-ray micro-computed tomography (SR-µCT) to establish the relationship between the preparation process and microsphere architectures. It was found that the microstructure and morphology of the microspheres were significantly influenced by preparation processes as the primary factors to determine the release profiles and taste-masking effects. The sphericity of ibuprofen microspheres congealed in citric acid solution was higher than that of other two and its morphology was more regular than that being congealed in air or distilled water, and the contact angles between congealing media and melted ibuprofen in octadecanol and glycerin monostearate well demonstrated the structure differences among microspheres of three processes which controlled the release characteristics of the microspheres.

This amino acid derivative is a byproduct of glutathione metabolism, and is reabsorbed efficiently in kidney by Na(+)-coupled transport mechanisms. Previous studies have focused on potential participation of amino acid transport systems in renal reabsorption of this compound. Here we show that it is not the amino acid transport systems but instead the Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 that plays a predominant role in this reabsorptive process. Expression of cloned human and mouse SLC5A8 in mammalian cells induces Na(+)-dependent transport of pyroglutamate that is inhibitable by various SLC5A8 substrates. SLC5A8-mediated transport of pyroglutamate is saturable with a Michaelis constant of 0.36+/-0.04mM. Na(+)-activation of the transport process exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 1.8+/-0.4, indicating involvement of more than one Na(+) in the activation process. Expression of SLC5A8 in Xenopuslaevis oocytes induces Na(+)-dependent inward currents in the presence of pyroglutamate under voltage-clamp conditions. The concentration of pyroglutamate necessary for induction of half-maximal current is 0.19+/-0.01mM. The Na(+)-activation kinetics is sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 2.3+/-0.2. Ibuprofen, a blocker of SLC5A8, suppressed pyroglutamate-induced currents in SLC5A8-expressing oocytes; the concentration of the blocker necessary for causing half-maximal inhibition is 14+/-1microM. The involvement of SLC5A8 can be demonstrated in rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles by showing that the Na(+)-dependent uptake of pyroglutamate in these vesicles is inhibitable by known substrates of SLC5A8.

Analysis of MD simulations indicated that ibuprofen molecules prefer to be located in the hydrophobic acyl chain region of DMPC/cholesterol bilayers. This distribution decreases the lateral motion of lipid molecules. The presence of ibuprofen molecules in the bilayers with 0 and 25mol% cholesterol increases the ordering of hydrocarbon tails of lipids whereas for the bilayers with 50mol% cholesterol, ibuprofen molecules perturb the flexible chains of DMPC lipids which leads to the reduction of the acyl chain order parameter. The potential of the mean force (PMF) method was used to calculate the free energy profile for the transferring of an ibuprofen molecule from the bulk water into the DMPC/cholesterol membranes. The PMF studies indicated that the presence of 50mol% cholesterol in the bilayers increases the free energy barrier and slows down the permeation of the ibuprofen drug across the DMPC bilayer.

The results indicated that the PEG-PIB pre-modified NPPCs exhibited inhibition of pyroptosis <i>in vitro</i>; their further synergistic transplantation yielded effective functional recovery, histological regeneration, and inhibition of pyroptosis during IDD regeneration.

The resulting peptide-amphiphile, consisting of four hydrophobic aliphatic tails and a hydrophilic peptide head group, was able to self-assemble into nanosized micelles in aqueous medium at low concentration. Ibuprofen and doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded into peptide micelles as model hydrophobic drugs respectively, and the sustained release behavior was observed. Due to the incorporation of targeted arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences and cell penetrating peptide (CPP) residue octaarginine (R(8)), the micelles could be recognized specifically by cancer cells, as well as transport through the cell membrane efficiently. The observation of laser-scanning confocal microscopy confirmed effective cellular uptaking of porphyrin-loaded peptide micelles. Furthermore, the porphyrin-loaded micelles exhibited low dark toxicity and high phototoxicity against cancer cells, indicating the powerful potential for effective photodynamic therapy.

For kinetic transport of biochemical compounds or drug molecules, the permeability through the phospholipid membranes is a key kinetic property, but long timescales are hindering the accurate computation. Technological advances in high-performance computing therefore need to be accompanied by theoretical and methodological developments. In this contribution, the replica exchange transition interface sampling (RETIS) methodology is shown to give perspective toward observing longer permeation pathways. It is first reviewed how RETIS, a path-sampling methodology that gives in principle exact kinetics, can be used to compute membrane permeability. Next, recent and current developments in three RETIS aspects are discussed: several new Monte Carlo moves in the path-sampling algorithm, memory reduction by reducing pathlengths, and exploitation of parallel computing with CPU-imbalanced replicas. Finally, the memory reduction presenting a new replica exchange implementation, coined REPPTIS, is showcased with a permeant needing to pass a membrane with two permeation channels, either representing an entropic or energetic barrier. The REPPTIS results showed clearly that inclusion of some memory and enhancing ergodic sampling via replica exchange moves are both necessary to obtain correct permeability estimates. In an additional example, ibuprofen permeation through a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine membrane was modeled. REPPTIS succeeded in estimating the permeability of this amphiphilic drug molecule with metastable states along the permeation pathway. In conclusion, the presented methodological advances allow for deeper insight into membrane biophysics even if the pathways are slow, as RETIS and REPPTIS push the permeability calculations to longer timescales.",2023,,"Vervust W, Zhang DT, van Erp TS, Ghysels A.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2023.02.021,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details of the methodology', 'Specific results on ibuprofen permeability', 'Comparative analysis with traditional methods', 'Data supporting permeability estimates']","The study focuses on ibuprofen permeation modeling using a new methodological approach, providing clear relevance for in vitro permeation studies.

It has been detected in effluents of wastewater plant treatments, sewage sludge, hospital wastewaters, surface waters, and drinking water due to its continuous release to the environment, mainly from the excretion in the urine of animals and humans. IBP is a carcinogenic and non-steroidal endocrine disrupting drug with harmful effects over fungal, bacterial, algae, microorganisms, crustacean, and fish species, and can be potentially hazard for human health. Since conventional treatments remove inefficiently this drug, many advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed aiming their abatement from waters to avoid their harmful health problems. This paper presents an exhaustive and critical review on the application of AOPs to treat synthetic waters, natural waters, and real wastewaters polluted with IBP alone or mixed with other common drugs covering up to 2020.

However, there is a lack of data in the scientific literature regarding these events.<h4>Objectives</h4>This report describes a case of an anaphylactoid reaction, considered probably ciprofloxacin related, that manifested as angioedema and later as pulmonary edema. This report also summarizes the available scientific evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and outcome of ciprofloxacin-associated anaphylactoid reactions.<h4>Methods</h4>Previously reported cases were identified using a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (years: 1960-June 2009; English-language articles; search terms: ciprofloxacin, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema, and pulmonary edema). The references cited in these articles were examined to identify additional reports. CASE SUMMARY/RESULTS: A 25-year-old healthy white woman with a weight of 65 kg and normal renal function presented with pyelonephritis. She was administered ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID PO and ibuprofen 400 mg q6h PO as needed for pain control. The following day, angioedema and pulmonary edema developed and were thought to be probably associated with ciprofloxacin use (Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score, 6). Ciprofloxacin treatment was discontinued and supportive care with ceftriaxone 1 g/d IV was provided, and the patient recovered after 1 week of hospitalization. The adverse drug reactions associated with the intake of fluoroquinolones most commonly affect the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, and skin. The literature search identified 64 cases of anaphylactoid reaction considered probably ciprofloxacin related. Forty-two of these cases were described in large studies, with no detailed data reported. Detailed information on the dose of ciprofloxacin, the time period between ciprofloxacin administration and anaphylactoid reaction, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of these reactions was available in 22 cases described in case reports. Twelve of these cases were described in HIV- patients; 10 cases were described in HIV+ patients. All of the patients recovered, with the exception of 2 patients with HIV infection, who died (unknown cause of death in 1 case and toxoplasma encephalitis in the other case). Fourteen patients (including all of the patients with HIV infection) required hospitalization in the intensive care unit. According to the manufacturer of ciprofloxacin, pulmonary edema has been described as an adverse event associated with ciprofloxacin in <1% of treated patients. However, a search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases did not identify any documented reports of ciprofloxacin-associated pulmonary edema.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The patient described in this case report experienced an anaphylactoid reaction likely associated with ciprofloxacin use.

The release of the ibuprofen was studied by vertical diffusion cell (Franz cell) at pH 7.4 at 25 and 37.5°C. The structure of the core-shell nanoparticles have significantly changed as the pH has risen from 3.0 to 7.4. Kinetic models were used to describe the release mechanism. The experimental results demonstrated that the BSA has an ordered structure at pH=3 which will become random coil by adding ibuprofen. The first shell restores the ordered structure of the protein.

As a consequence of such variability in pH there is a corresponding variability in the degree of ionisation which in turn, could influence permeation through the mainly hydrophobic-rich membrane structure. This study reports the effect of pH on the permeation of five model compounds (benzoic acid, benzotriazole, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and lidocaine). For the five compounds analysed, each at three distinct percentages of ionisation, it was found that the greater extent of permeation was always for the more 'neutral', i.e. more greatly unionised, species rather than the anionic or cationic species. These findings fit with the theory that the hydrophobic membrane encourages permeation of 'lipid-like' structures, i.e. the more unionised form of compounds. However, results obtained with an Inverse Gas Chromatography Surface Energy Analyser (iGC SEA) indicate the membrane surface to be an electron dense environment. In the knowledge that unionised forms of compounds permeate (rather than the charged species) this negatively charged surface was not anticipated, i.e. the basic membrane surface did not appear to affect permeation.",2016,,"Waters LJ, Bhuiyan AKMMH.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.01.055,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,no,synthetic_membrane,"['Detailed methodology for ibuprofen experimentation', 'Specific results for ibuprofen permeation', 'pH levels used in the experiments']","The study directly investigates the permeation of ibuprofen through synthetic membranes, making it relevant for the dataset.

Deep eutectic lidocaine ibuprofen (Lid·Ibu) was selected as the oil phase, and the imidazolium ionic liquid, 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([HOEmim]Cl), was incorporated into the aqueous phase as a transdermal enhancer. The ingredients for the microemulsion in this study were selected, and their ratios were optimized. The optimal microemulsion carrier was composed of 45 wt% of water phase, 45 wt% surfactant phase (containing Tween-80, Span-20, and ethanol (co-surfactant) with the weight ratio of 1:1:1), and 10 wt% Lid·Ibu as the oil phase with artemisinin loading of 1.0 wt% (all the ratios were based on the total weight of microemulsion). Physical properties of this microemulsion, including particle size (41.95 ± 0.85 nm), viscosity (26.65 ± 0.13 mPa·s) and density (1.02 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), were measured. In-vitro transdermal assay showed a remarkable enhancement of artemisinin transport through the skin, with the permeation flux being 3-fold of the value for isopropyl myristate system in 6 h. The impact of IL-based microemulsion (ILME) on stratum corneum (SC) was investigated by DSC, ATR-FTIR and AFM, which unveiled that the ILME possesses the ability of reducing the SC barrier by disrupting the regular arrangement of keratin, resulting in enhancement of transdermal delivery of artemisinin.

A preliminary chemical analysis of wastewater identified several compounds associated with PPCPs, including caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, oxytetracycline, novobiocin, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine. The purpose of this study was to examine the cytotoxic and oxidative effects of these products and other wastewater-related products (i.e., coprostanol, cotinine, estradiol-17beta, nonylphenol, and cholesterol) in primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes. The redox activity of various PPCPs in trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver microsomes was investigated in vitro by tracking the rate of oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and the formation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) after a 60-min incubation period. In addition, primary cultures of rainbow trout hepatocytes were exposed to various drugs identified in the municipal effluent for 48 h at 15 degrees C. Our results show that most PPCPs (83%) accelerated the rate of NADPH oxidation in the presence of microsomes and 72% of them increased LPO in microsomal membranes. LPO levels were significantly correlated (R = 0.5; P<0.05) with the number of functional groups on the molecule's backbone (i.e., number of O, S, N, P/number of C and H) and negatively so (R = -0.44; P<0.05) with the octanol/water partition coefficient, suggesting that nucleophilicity and hydrophobicity are related to oxidative activity for these compounds. Exposure of trout hepatocytes to these products leads in many cases to decreased cell viability, increased CYP3A-related monooxygenase activity (benzylether resorufin dealkylase), and LPO. No induction of CYP1A1-related activity (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase) was observed. Moreover, municipal effluent extracts (ethanol) were able to increase all the above responses in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the basic redox properties of PPCPs could influence oxidative metabolism in liver cells and lead to oxidative damage. These products have the potential to produce a toxic response in aquatic organisms and the above biomarkers were shown to respond readily to PPCPs in aquatic organisms.",2006,,"Gagné F, Blaise C, André C.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2005.04.004,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Methodology for in vitro testing', 'Specific outcomes related to ibuprofen', ""Any mention of ibuprofen's permeation"", 'Cytotoxic effects specific to ibuprofen']",The study primarily focuses on the toxicity of various pharmaceuticals in wastewater rather than on their permeation or release characteristics.,0.6

Although a handful of previous studies have shown the impacts of pharmaceutically active compounds on the environment, the toxicological effects of their degradation products remain largely unknown. In the current study, the photo-degradation products of environmental ibuprofen were assessed for both ecotoxicological and human health effects using a series of in vitro assays. Here, six of the major degradation products are synthesized with high purity (>98%) and characterized with <sup>1</sup>HNMR, <sup>13</sup>CNMR, FT-IR and HRMS. To evaluate human health effects, three gut microbiota species, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, and two human cell lines, HEK293T and HepG2, are exposed to various concentrations of ibuprofen and its degradation products. On L. acidophilus, the ibuprofen degradation product (±)-(2R,3R)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol shows a greater toxic effect while ibuprofen enhances its growth at lower concentrations. At higher concentrations, ibuprofen shows at least a 2-fold higher toxicity compared to that of its degradation products. However, E. faecalis shows little or no effect upon exposure to these compounds. An induction of the SOS response in E. coli is observed but limited to only ibuprofen and 4-acetylbenzoic acid. In human cell line studies, survival of both HEK293T and HepG2 cell lines is profoundly impaired by the photo-degradation products of (±)- (2R,3R)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol, (±)-(2R,3S)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-5-methylhexan-3-ol, and (±)-1-(4-(1-hydroxy-2methylpropyl)phenyl)ethan-1-one. In this work, the bioluminescence bacterium, Aliivibrio fischeri, is used as a model to assess environmental impact. Both ibuprofen and its degradation products inhibit the growth of this gram-negative bacteria with the primary compound showing the most significant impact.

In this study, the activity of ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was evaluated on the control of pre-established adhered cells (2 h) and 24 h old biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial adhesion was performed by S. aureus CECT 976, while biofilm formation was also performed by the antibiotic-resistant strains: SA1199B, RN4220 and XU212. The treatment with ibuprofen promoted metabolic reductions up to 80% and total loss of culturability of adhered cells and 24 h old biofilms. Ibuprofen demonstrated moderate efficacy to remove biofilms of S. aureus CECT 976 (removal ≤ 40%), but did not display removal action against the antibiotic-resistant strains. Antibacterial activity (inhibitory and bactericidal) and mode of action of ibuprofen were also assessed using different bacterial physiological indices. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of the four S. aureus strains ranged between 500 and 2000 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and 1400 - >2000 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. After S. aureus CECT 976 incubation with ibuprofen, cell permeation to propidium iodide, release of intracellular potassium and changes on cell surface hydrophobicity were observed.

The present study describes the synthesis of new thiazoline, thiadiazoline and thiazolidinone steroid compounds combined with lactone, lactam or pyridine moieties. These steroid hybrid molecules may be potential candidates for drug design, with improved biological activity and bioavailability. The starting androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone were modified by multiphase synthesis into thiosemicarbazone androstane derivatives, direct precursors for the synthesis of new heterocyclic compounds.

Uterine rings were used for isometric tension recording. Effect of SLIGRL (0.1 mM) on spontaneous contractions before and after exposure to ibuprofen (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 1.0 microM), SQ-29548 (thromboxane A(2) receptor inhibitor, 1.0 microM), ketotifen (histamine 1 receptor inhibitor, 10 microM), WEB-2170BS (platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor inhibitor, 10 microM), atropine (muscarinic receptor inhibitor, 0.1 microM), or ketanserin (serotonin receptor inhibitor, 10 microM) were compared. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's or Newman-Keuls post hoc tests were used for statistical analysis when appropriate.<h4>Significance</h4>P<0.05.<h4>Results</h4>The agents did not significantly affect time-associated decay in spontaneous contractile activity in any group of the tissues. Activation of spontaneous contractions induced by SLIGRL in non-pregnant rat myometrium did not involve coactivation of membrane chemoceptors, while in mid-pregnant rat myometrium coactivation of prostanoid, histamine, and serotonin receptors and in late pregnant rat myometrium coactivation of thromboxane receptors was noted. Expression of PAR-2 mRNA was similar in non-pregnant, mid-pregnant, and late pregnant rat myometrium.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Expression of PAR-2 in rat myometrium is not dependent on gestational age.

The ASC₁₆ and ASC₁₂ derivatives gave rise to stable supramolecular assemblies in water and in water/PEG mixtures (coagels), allowing the solubilization of IBU (0.85%) and producing a IBU controlled release systems, as evidenced by the dynamic dialyse test: the n values were near 1.0, indicative of a linear kinetic, for all coagel formulations, except for the ASC₁₂PEG/C formulation (n=1.51). Our results evidenced the enhancement activity of coagels and the synergic effect of the combination with PEG: all coagels showed a higher amount of IBU permeated through the skin compared to commercial Arfen® with an enhancement factor of 52.94 and 21.53 for ASC₁₂PEG/C and ASC₁₆/C respectively. Otherwise, coagels formulations appeared to produce a low IBU depot in the skin and in the same order of magnitude in epidermis and derma, in spite of significant increase of IBU cutaneous permeation. The positive synergic effect of the coagel-PEG mixtures was demonstrated by the high amount of IBU accumulated in the upper skin layers. The effect of the coagels on the IBU skin permeation and distribution depending on their hydro-lipophilic character could allow a rational design and an optimization of topical formulations.",2010,,"Saino V, Monti D, Burgalassi S, Tampucci S, Palma S, Allemandi D, Chetoni P.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2010.08.004,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed methodology for skin permeation studies', 'Specific measurements of ibuprofen concentration', 'Statistical analysis of results', 'Comparative analysis with other formulations']","The study evaluates ibuprofen permeation through skin using specific formulations and provides measurable outcomes, making it relevant for the dataset.",0.9

However, they have not been explored before for transdermal application. Here, we study the behavior of LNC as a transdermal drug delivery system using ibuprofen as a model drug. A comparison to other lipid nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and polymeric nanocarriers has been made. It was found that LNC could increase the flux rate of ibuprofen 21.9±0.5 compared to 5.8±0.4 μg/cm(2)h in case of drug solution. Similar flux rates were obtained for SLN and NLC with average values of 22.9±0.5 and 22.5±2.0 μg/cm(2)h, respectively. On the other side, comparison to polymeric nanoparticles showed that the polymer-based carriers of the same particle size had lower permeation-enhancing effect with a flux rate of 10.62±1.84 μg/cm(2)h. Polymeric carriers had fourfold higher accumulation in the skin compared to that of the LNC and twice the accumulation of SLN and NLC.

Using a mucoadhesive material is an efficient solution to improve ocular drug therapeutic efficacy. This study was designed to prepare a liposomal formulation coated by a novel adhesive excipient, silk fibroin (SF), for topical ocular drug delivery. The regenerated silk fibroins (SFs) with different dissolving time were coated onto the ibuprofen-loaded liposomes. The morphology, drug encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release and in vitro corneal permeation of SF-coated liposomes (SLs) were investigated in comparison with the conventional liposome. Cellular adhesion and cytotoxicity assay of SF and SLs were tested using human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC). SLs showed sustained drug release and in vitro corneal permeation of ibuprofen as compared to drug solution and conventional liposome. The cellular fluorescence appeared after 7 min of exposure to SF, and the intensity increased sustainedly up to 12h with no detectable cytotoxicity. Higher fluorescence intensity of Nile red in SLs was observed in a short period of 15 min showing a rapid uptake.

UV imaging has proven to be very versatile in the area of pharmaceutics giving insights into various phenomena including the dissolution behaviour of dosage forms, intrinsic dissolution rates and the drug precipitation processes. A 3D printed diffusion cell in the similitude of a Franz cell was successfully printed using polylactic acid (PLA) filaments equipped with quartz for the imaging area. A model ibuprofen (IBU) gel formulation was tested by introducing the dosage form through the 3D printed donor compartment. The drug concentration permeated through the skin mimic (silicone membrane) was determined from the 3D printed receptor compartment using UV imaging in real-time. The results showed successful UV imaging of the permeation of IBU gel in the novel diffusion cell potentially negating further analytical testing such as the HPLC process required for Franz cell tests thereby reducing costs.

Ibuprofen and its structural modifications in the form of ibuprofenates of isopropyl esters of L-amino acids such as L-valine, L-phenylalanine, L-proline, and L-aspartic acid were used in the research. To this end, Franz cells with skin as membrane were exposed to 50 Hz RMF with 5% ibuprofen and its derivatives in an ethanol solution for 48 h. Following the exposures, the amount of penetrated compound was analysed. Regardless of the compound tested, a significant increase in drug transport through the skin was observed.

Also, we have tested whether the addition of lauric acid to propylene glycol improves skin permeation for the opioids and NSAIDs. We found that the addition of lauric acid to propylene glycol dramatically improves the penetration of the drugs, measured by the drug's ED(50). We observed a significant dose response shift to the left for all tested drugs. So, morphine's ED(50) was decreased by 19-fold. The duration of the analgesic activity of morphine dissolved in a combination of propylene glycol and lauric acid was much longer compared with the same dose of the drug dissolved in propylene glycol only. Methadone and hydrocodone also produced analgesic activity in this experimental paradigm. We then assessed potential interactions between opioids, ibuprofen and diclofenac using a fixed, low dose of each. The inclusion of either S-ibuprofen or diclofenac to a fixed, low dose of morphine raised the analgesic response from around 20% to 50% and 80%, respectively. Topical methadone and diclofenac alone produced analgesia in 30% of mice. The combination produced analgesia in 100% of mice (100% versus 60%, P<0.001) and the analgesic effect was observed for 90 min. Alone, topical methadone and S-ibuprofen produced analgesia in 25% and 30% of mice, respectively.

Unstirred water layer in iso-pH mapping assays and pKa(flux)--optimized design (pOD-PAMPA).,"Iso-pH mapping unstirred parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was used to measure the effective permeability, P(e), as a function of pH from 3 to 10, of five weak monoprotic acids (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, salicylic acid, benzoic acid), an ampholyte (piroxicam), five monoprotic weak bases (imipramine, verapamil, propranolol, phenazopyridine, metoprolol), and a diprotic weak base (quinine). The intrinsic permeability, P(o), the unstirred water layer (UWL) permeability, P(u), and the apparent pK(a) (pK(a)(flux)) were determined from the pH dependence of logP(e). The underlying permeability-pH equations were derived for multiprotic weak acids, weak bases and ampholytes. The average thickness of the unstirred water layer on each side of the membrane was estimated to be nearly 2000 microm, somewhat larger than that found in Caco-2 permeability assays (unstirred). Since the UWL thickness in the human intestine is believed to be about forty times smaller, it is critical to correct the in vitro permeability data for the effect of the UWL. Without such correction, the in vitro permeability coefficient of lipophilic molecules would be indicative only of the property of water. In single-pH PAMPA (e.g. pH 7.4), the uncertainty of the UWL contribution can be minimized if a specially-selected pH (possibly different from 7.4) were used in the assay. From the analysis of the shapes of the log P(e)-pH plots, a method to improve the selection of the assay pH, called pK(a)(flux)-optimized design (pOD-PAMPA), was described and tested.

Reduction of the charge on the molecule would be expected to enhance skin penetration. The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug benzydamine hydrochloride with suitable counter-ions including ibuprofen sodium. The influence of pH of the donor solution and hence degree of ionization on partitioning between n-octanol:buffer and the flux of benzydamine hydrochloride across polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) membrane and human epidermis was determined. The maximum flux was determined at pH 7.6 when the fraction unionized was 2.51%, rather than at pH 9 when the fraction unionized was 38.7%. This suggests that at higher pH, although the permeability coefficient is increased, the decrease in solubility and therefore concentration of dissolved benzydamine in the medium results in a decrease in flux across the PDMS membrane. Ion-pair formation or interaction with each of the counter-ions was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Significant increases in logP and flux across PDMS membrane were determined for the ion-pairs (0.087, 12.54, 11.31, 0.121 microg cm(-2)h(-1) for benzydamine hydrochloride and ion-pairs with ibuprofen sodium, sodium benzoate and sodium octane sulfonate respectively).

The rigorous analysis of the concentration dependence of these processes is often limited by the lack of knowledge of the actual concentration at the site of action because the measurement of the local concentration is seldom feasible. However, the local concentrations can be estimated if the rates into and out of a particular location are known. Thus, an insight into the distribution of the permeation resistance in the in vitro cell monolayer permeation experiments would enable the estimation of local concentrations during the permeation experiments and, consequently, a more thorough analysis of the concentration dependent processes involved in the transepithelial transfer of compounds. In this study, a compartmental model was constructed applicable for dissecting the roles of apical and basal side aqueous boundary layers and the cell membranes in the total permeation barrier for weakly acidic and basic compounds.

The anti-inflammatory effect of these NSAID preparations was evaluated in rat models of acute inflammation (carrageenan or yeast treatment) and chronic inflammation (collagen or adjuvant treatment). Skin permeability of the preparations was evaluated in vitro using mouse skin. In rats with acute inflammation, both ketoprofen preparations significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced edema and yeast-induced hyperalgesia. Flurbiprofen and diclofenac preparations also showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect, but the ketoprofen products were the most potent among the four patch preparations and five gel preparations. With repeated application, the ketoprofen patch significantly decreased edema from day 3 in collagen-treated rats, while other preparations (ketoprofen gel, diclofenac patch, and diclofenac gel) decreased edema from day 7. In rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, only the ketoprofen patch significantly decreased edema after 2 weeks of application. In the skin permeation study, the ketoprofen preparations showed higher skin permeability compared with the other NSAID preparations. These results suggested that ketoprofen preparations had the most potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity related to good skin permeability.

The in-vitro release of ibuprofen from the hydrogels was investigated by a modified Franz diffusion cell filled with a MES buffer solution, with pH of 5.5, at 37°C, for a period of 48h to investigate the effects of the crosslinking agent type, crosslinking mole ratio, mesh size, electric potential, and conductive polymer. The release behavior of ibuprofen from the pectin hydrogels was found to involve 4 modes of release: Fickian diffusion; Anomalous transport; Case-II transport; and Super case II transport. The diffusion coefficient was shown to be significantly improved by two factors: using a FeCl<sub>2</sub> as the crosslinking agent and applied electric potential. For both crosslinking agents, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing crosslinking ratio. Under electric field of 5V, the drug diffusion coefficients of the FeCl<sub>2</sub> and citric acid hydrogels were enhanced by more than a factor of two due to the electro-repulsive interaction between ibuprofen and the negatively charged electrode. Moreover, the synthesized poly(3-methoxydiphenylamine) embedded in the pectin hydrogels as the drug encapsulation host was shown to enhance the diffusion coefficients and to reduce the overall release times.",2018,,"Mongkolkitikul S, Paradee N, Sirivat A.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2017.10.043,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on formulation of the hydrogel', 'Exact measurements of ibuprofen release kinetics', 'Impact of electric potential on drug release', 'Comparison of release across different formulation parameters']","The study investigates the release of ibuprofen using a Franz diffusion cell, indicating it will provide relevant data for the dataset.

Electroporation had great influences on the structure of stratum corneum to improve the cumulative permeability due to the formation of pores maintaining for at least 2 h, depending on the power and time, and then the permeation gradually recovered to the normal value after 12 h. A mathematical model was firstly established to exhibit the relationship between the electroporation-improving cumulative permeation and the physiochemical properties of the model drugs, involving oil-water partition coefficient (logP), dissociation constant (pKa) and solubility (S).

For topical products having remarkably similar composition, both EMA and FDA accept the equivalence on the bases of the comparison of rheological properties and in vitro drug release constant (k) and skin permeation flux (J) values, instead of clinical studies. This work aims to evaluate the feasibility to expand this approach to variations of the composition of complex semi-solid preparations. Ibuprofen (IB) creams at two different strengths (i.e., 1 % and 10 %) were used as a model formulation. Two formulative changes were performed: (a) the addition of the humectant to simulate a minor post-marketing variation; (b) the substitution of the emulsifying system to simulate a major one. These variations impacted only in 1 % IB formulations where both the equivalences of rheological data and J-values failed. At the highest concentration, the presence of IB crystals broke down the differences in rheological patterns and lead the IB thermodynamic activity at the maximum figuring out an overlapping of the J-values.

In this work, a comprehensive simulation study on the diffusion of the native <i>α</i>-, <i>β</i>- and <i>γ</i>-CDs in aqueous solutions is carried out using Molecular Dynamics simulations. The effect of the system size on the computed self-diffusivity is investigated and it is found that the required correction can be as much as 75% of the final value. The effect of the water force field is examined and it is shown that the q4md-CD/TIP4P/2005 force field combination predicts the experimentally measured self-diffusion coefficients of CDs very accurately. The self-diffusion coefficients of the three native CDs were also computed in aqueous-NaCl solutions using the Joung and Cheatham (JC) and the Madrid-2019 force fields. It is found that Na + ions have higher affinity towards the CDs when the JC force field is used and for this reason the predicted diffusivity of CDs is lower compared to simulations using the Madrid-2019 force field. As a model system for drug delivery and waste-water treatment applications, the diffusion of the <i>β</i>-CD:Ibuprofen inclusion complex in water is studied.

It is therefore important to consider whether ingredients other than the active may: 1) alter absorption of the active chemical, or 2) be absorbed themselves, resulting in systemic effects. Frogs have highly permeable skin and are routinely exposed to commercial chemical products in the environment or therapeutically. Ethanol and propylene glycol (PG), which have known penetration-enhancing effects, are commonly included in such products. The current study has therefore investigated the <i>in vitro</i> absorption kinetics through <i>Rh. marina</i> skin of three model chemicals - caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen - formulated individually as solutions containing: 1%, 10% or 30% v/v ethanol, or 20% v/v PG. Differential scanning calorimetry and histology were used to characterise fresh frog skin, investigate the mechanism of these enhancers in frog skin, and to determine whether these enhancers significantly affected skin structure. Results showed that the extent of absorption enhancement was influenced by chemical, enhancer and skin region, and that enhancement was generally not consistent for individual enhancers or skin regions. The exception was 1% v/v ethanol, which did not significantly alter flux across the skin for any of the chemicals evaluated. Caffeine absorption was not enhanced by any of the investigated penetration enhancers, and was in fact significantly reduced by 30% v/v ethanol and PG. Ethanol caused concentration-dependant changes in skin morphology and should be avoided in concentrations ≥10% v/v. PG, however, caused minimal changes to the skin and consistently improved absorption of benzoic acid and ibuprofen through all skin regions. Owing to the significant changes in skin structure following ≥10% v/v ethanol exposure, it is recommended to avoid its use in frogs.

Tecovirimat is an antiviral specifically designed to inhibit smallpox infection diffusion and approved by the FDA for other Orthopoxvirus infections; its efficacy in mpox-infected patients is not well established. We present the case of a cardiac complication during mpox infection in a previously undiagnosed Lyme disease in a 42-year-old man living with HIV. Two days after the typical maculopapular rash, the patient reported a rise in body temperature up to 39 °C, chest pain without irradiation, and shortness of breath. We found an increase in troponin level, a slight reduction in ejection fraction, and grade 2 AV block (Mobitz 1 and 2) with frequent sinus pauses (the longest of 10.1 s). Given the suspicion of myopericarditis with cardiac conduction system involvement, the patient was admitted to the Intermediate Care Unit for continuous monitoring and further evaluation. Treatment included Ibuprofen 600 mg every 12 hours (bid) and colchicine 1 mg once daily for anti-inflammatory purposes. Concomitantly, treatment with tecovirimat was started at 600 mg bid for a total of 14 days. Cardiac MRI with gadolinium showed mild interstitial edema and pericardial enhancement. However, despite the clinical and laboratory resolution of the acute phase, bradycardia with episodes of AV block persisted at follow-up, suggesting the possibility of an additional etiology.

A variety of liquids, encompassing natural oils, synthetic and non-oil liquids, and a eutectic mixture, were incorporated with NR using solvent displacement technique. Successful formulations were achieved for several oily liquids, with viscosity correlating to NR concentration. Particularly, a eutectic mixture of menthol and camphor exhibited optimal viscosity by direct dissolving enabling the development of transdermal ibuprofen delivery and injectable azithromycin for periodontitis treatment. NR prolonged the release of both drugs. The extended-release ibuprofen system holds promise for transdermal applications, while the azithromycin system displayed inhibitory effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, suggesting potential for periodontitis treatment.

This study explored the synthesis of dual stimuli-responsive composite hydrogels by combining poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) with 4, 8, and 12 % (w/w) of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) through in-situ free-radical polymerization, modifying their properties for topical anti-inflammatory release. Although PDMAEMA-based hydrogels have been known for their responsiveness to pH and temperature stimuli, which are useful for modulating the release profile of drugs, their use as a matrix for anti-inflammatory topical applications remains unexplored. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of CNC concentration's impact on PDMAEMA-based hydrogel structure and physicochemical properties is provided. The incorporation of ibuprofen as an anti-inflammatory model was assessed, providing insights into the potential of these composite hydrogels for sustained drug delivery applications. Overall, the hydrogels exhibited homogenous CNC dispersion, with gel fraction higher than 70 % and ibuprofen load higher than 90 %. The rise in CNC concentration led to an increase hydrogel stiffness.

Our previous studies have shown that while electrospun nanofiber-bundle membranes promote cellular and tissue infiltration through their porous architecture, they also induce an elevated foreign body response (FBR) that impedes tissue integration and remodeling. In this study, we functionalized electrospun polylactic acid (PLA)/gelatin (Gel) nanofiber-bundle membrane with chitosan (CS) and ibuprofen (IBU) to improve its biological performance for abdominal wall repair. Our results demonstrate that grafted CS and IBU functionalize the PLA/Gel membrane with antibacterial and antioxidant capacity. The PLA/Gel-CS-IBU membrane showed good biocompatibility as evidenced by in vitro cell studies, blood compatibility assessments, and subcutaneous implantation. It exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activity and modulated macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. CS-IBU grafting downregulated pro-inflammatory gene expression induced by the porous electrospun membrane surface, decreased oxidative products from activated macrophages, and upregulated anti-inflammatory genes. By markedly suppressing inflammatory responses and stimulating tissue regeneration, it facilitated effective tissue remodeling in a rat full-thickness abdominal wall model.

Starting with equimolar egg-phosphatidylcholine (PC)/cholesterol liposomes, the influence of the liposomal composition and surface charge on the incorporation and retention of a model poorly water soluble drug, ibuprofen was investigated. Both the incorporation and the release of ibuprofen were influenced by the lipid composition of the multi-lamellar vesicles (MLV) with inclusion of the long alkyl chain lipid (dilignoceroyl phosphatidylcholine (C24PC)) resulting in enhanced ibuprofen incorporation efficiency and retention. The cholesterol content of the liposome bilayer was also shown to influence ibuprofen incorporation with maximum ibuprofen incorporation efficiency achieved when 4 micromol of cholesterol was present in the MLV formulation. Addition of anionic lipid dicetylphosphate (DCP) reduced ibuprofen drug loading presumably due to electrostatic repulsive forces between the carboxyl group of ibuprofen and the anionic head-group of DCP. In contrast, the addition of 2 micromol of the cationic lipid stearylamine (SA) to the liposome formulation (PC:Chol - 16 micromol:4 micromol) increased ibuprofen incorporation efficiency by approximately 8%. However further increases of the SA content to 4 micromol and above reduced incorporation by almost 50% compared to liposome formulations excluding the cationic lipid. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was used to dynamically follow the changes in liposome morphology during dehydration to provide an alternative assay of liposome stability. ESEM analysis clearly demonstrated that ibuprofen incorporation improved the stability of PC:Chol liposomes as evidenced by an increased resistance to coalescence during dehydration.

We also explored the association of lactic acid and iontophoresis as a means of enhancing drug delivery. Permeation experiments were performed in vitro, using rabbit ear skin as barrier. The results obtained indicate that lactic acid has some effects on model drug permeation across the skin. The effect was more evident with the anionic drug ibuprofen. Cathodal intophoresis increased ibuprofen transport, but when lactic acid was associated with cathodal iontophoresis, a concentration-dependent reduction of ibuprofen iontophoretic flux was observed, probably for the competition by the co-ion.

Ethyl oleate (EO) was screened as the oil phase of microemulsions, due to a good solubilizing capacity of the microemulison systems and excellent skin permeation rate of ibuprofen. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams for microemulsion regions were constructed using ethyl oleate as the oil, Tween 80 as the surfactant, propylene glycol as the cosurfactant. Various microemulsion formulations were prepared and the abilities of various microemulsions to deliver ibuprofen through the skin were evaluated in vitro using Franz diffusion cells fitted with porcine skins. The in vitro permeation data showed that microemulsions increased the permeation rate of ibuprofen 5.72-30.0 times over the saturated solution. The optimum formulation consisted of 3% ibuprofen, 6% EO, 30% Tween 80/PG (2:1) and water, showed a high permeation rate of 38.06 microg cm(-2) h(-1).

Diffusion studies of saturated solutions in 50:50 water/ethanol of methyl paraben (MP), ibuprofen (IBU) and caffeine (CF) were performed on Carbosil membrane. The spectroscopic data were analysed by target factor analysis, and evolution profiles of the signal for each component (i.e. the drug, water, ethanol and membrane) over time were obtained. Results showed that the data were successfully deconvoluted as correlations between factors from the data and reference spectra of the components, were above 0.8 in all cases. Good reproducibility over three runs for the evolution profiles was obtained. From the evolution profiles it was observed that water diffused better through the Carbosil membrane than ethanol, confirming the hydrophilic properties of the Carbosil membrane used. IBU diffused slower compared with MP and CF. The evolution profile of CF was very similar to that of water, probably because of the high solubility of CF in water, indicating that both compounds are diffusing concurrently. The second part of the work involved a study of the evolution profiles of the components of a commercial topical gel containing 5% (w/w) of ibuprofen as it permeated through human skin.

Initially porous/non-porous, ibuprofen/lidocaine/propranolol HCl-loaded systems were exposed to phosphate buffer pH 7.4 in agitated test tubes, varying the microparticle concentration from 5:1 to 20:1mg:mL. Interestingly, drug release was virtually unaffected by the ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratio in the case of initially porous, ibuprofen-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete drug release within about 1 week. Optical microscopy, SEM, DSC and pH measurements of the bulk fluid revealed no major impact of the microparticle concentration on the systems' properties within the first couple of days. However, a more rapid and pronounced decrease in the pH of the release medium occurred after 10-14 d at elevated ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratios. This resulted in an accelerated: (i) decrease in the glass transition temperature, (ii) microparticle agglomeration, and (iii) increase in the internal and external microparticle porosity. Importantly, this phenomenon did not significantly affect drug release from initially porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete release within about 18 d. In contrast, drug release became significantly faster at higher ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratios in the case of initially non-porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles and initially porous, propranolol HCl-loaded systems, exhibiting complete release after 1 and 2 months, respectively.

The primary surfactant was PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides (Labrasol). The cosurfactants were commercially available mixtures of octoxynol-12 and polysorbate 20 without or with the addition of PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil (Solubilisant gamma 2421 and Solubilisant gamma 2429, respectively). The oil phase of microemulsions was isopropyl myristate. Phase behaviour study of the pseudo-ternary systems Labrasol/cosurfactant/oil/water at surfactant-to-cosurfactant weight ratios (K(m)) 40:60, 50:50 and 60:40, revealed a strong synergism in the investigated tensides mixtures for stabilisation of microemulsions containing up to 80% (w/w) of water phase at surfactant +cosurfactant-to-oil weight ratio (SCoS/O) 90:10. Solubilization of a model drug ibuprofen in concentration common for topical application (5%, w/w) was achieved at the water contents below 50% (w/w). Drug free and ibuprofen-loaded microemulsions M1-M6, containing 45% (w/w) of water phase, were prepared and characterized by polarized light microscopy, conductivity, pH, rheological and droplet size measurements. In vitro ibuprofen release kinetics from the microemulsions was investigated using paddle-over-enhancer cell method and compared with the commercial 5% (w/w) ibuprofen hydrogel product (Deep Relief, Mentholatum Company Ltd., USA). The investigated microemulsions were isotropic, low viscous Bingham-type liquids with the pH value (4.70-6.61) suitable for topical application. The different efficiency of the tensides mixtures for microemulsion stabilisation was observed, depending on the cosurfactant type and K(m) value. Solubilisant gamma 2429 as well as higher K(m) (i.e., lower relative content of the cosurfactant) provided higher surfactant/cosurfactant synergism. The drug molecules were predominantly solubilized within the interface film. The amount of drug released from the formulations M3 (10.75%, w/w) and M6 (13.45%, w/w) (K(m) 60:40) was limited in comparison with the reference (22.22%, w/w) and follows the Higuchi model. Microemulsions M2 and M5 (K(m) 50:50) gave zero order drug release pattern and ∼15% (w/w) ibuprofen released. The release profiles from microemulsions M1 and M4 (K(m) 40:60) did not fit well with the models used for analysis, although the amounts of ibuprofen released (24.47%, w/w) and 17.99% (w/w), respectively) were comparable to that of the reference hydrogel.

The main drawback for the transdermal route, however, is the low efficiency achieved in the absorption of many drugs, mostly due to the complexity of the skin barrier. To improve drug delivery through the skin, we prepared and characterized liposomes loaded with ibuprofen and designed pharmaceutical formulations based on the extemporaneous addition of penetration enhancer (PE) surfactants. Afterwards, permeation and release studies were carried out. According to the permeation studies, the ibuprofen liposomal formulation supplemented with PEs exhibited similar therapeutic effects, but at lower doses (20%) comparing with a commercial formulation used as a reference. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the effect caused by PEs on the adsorption mechanism of liposomal formulations onto the skin. Non-fused liposomes, bilayers and multilayered lipid structures were observed.

However, The transdermal enhancement mechanism of iontophoresis was not well known. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of drugs and the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis was revealed in this study. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used as the models, including aspirin, ibuprofen and indomethacin. Their oil-water partition coefficients were measured. The carbomer-based hydrogels of them were prepared. Iontophoresis significantly enhanced in vitro transdermal delivery across the rat skins. Strong lipophilicity could lead to high permeation of drugs. However, the dissociation extent (indicated as pKa) of drugs was the key factor to determine the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis. The more dissociation the drugs were, the higher the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis. The drug-loaded hydrogels combined with iontophoresis improved the treatment of rat raw's inflammatory syndrome. Iontophoresis significantly improved the drugs penetrating into the hypodermis, dermis and epidermis, more deeply than the application of drugs alone according to the experimental result of 5-carboxylfluorescein hydrogels.

The ternary nanogels were prepared by a combination of electrostatic nanoassembly and ionic gelation techniques. The electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding between ibuprofen and chitosan were confirmed with FTIR, while DSC, TGA and SEM confirmed the physical state, thermal and morphological characteristics, respectively. The ex vivo delivery of ibuprofen onto and across the skin was evaluated based on system specific drug release parameters such as steady state permeation rate, permeability coefficient, permeability enhancement ratio, skin/gel partition coefficient, diffusion coefficient, lag time and release rate constant and mechanisms of release were determined using mathematical models. Interaction between ibuprofen and chitosan produced new spherical eutectic nanoconjugates with remarkable decrease in particle size of ibuprofen from 4580 (length-to-breadth aspect ratio) to a minimum of 14.15 nm (324-times), and thermally stable amorphous characteristics. The nanogels exhibited significant elastic and pseudoplastic characteristics dictated by the concentration of chitosan with maximum swelling capacity of 775% w/w at 6.55 mM chitosan compared with 281.16 and 506.50% for plain gellan and control ibuprofen hydrogel, respectively. Chitosan enhanced the skin penetration, permeability and the rate of transdermal release of ibuprofen by a factor of 4, dictated by the extent of ibuprofen-chitosan ionic interaction and its concentration.

Formulation study of pseudo-ternary system liquid lecithin/poloxamer 407/water at constant liquid lecithin/poloxamer 407 mass ratio (2.0) revealed that minimum concentrations of liquid lecithin and poloxamer 407 required for formation of gel like systems were 15.75% w/w and 13.13% w/w, respectively, while the maximum content of water was 60.62% w/w. The systems comprising water concentrations in a range from 55 to 60.62% w/w were soft semisolids suitable for topical application, and they were selected for physicochemical and biopharmaceutical evaluation.

However there are ethical and safety issues associated with obtaining human tissue. For these reasons synthetic membranes, cell culture models or in silico predictive algorithms have been researched intensively as alternative approaches to predict dermal exposure in man. Porcine skin has also been recommended as an acceptable surrogate for topical or transdermal delivery research. Here we examine the in vitro permeation of a model active, ibuprofen, using human or porcine skin, as well as the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assay (PAMPA) model and silicone membrane. Finite dose studies were conducted in all models using commercial ibuprofen formulations and simple volatile ibuprofen solutions. The dose applied in the PAMPA model was also varied in order to determine the amount of applied formulation which best simulates typical amounts of topical products applied by patients or consumers. Permeation studies were conducted up to 6h for PAMPA and silicone and up to 48h for human and porcine skin. Cumulative amounts permeated at 6h were comparable for PAMPA and silicone, ranging from 91 to 136μg/cm(2) across the range of formulations studied. At 48h, maximum ibuprofen permeation in human skin ranged from 11 to 38μg/cm(2) and corresponding values in porcine skin were 59-81μg/cm(2). A dose of 1μL was confirmed as appropriate for finite dose studies in the PAMPA model. The formulation which delivered the greatest amount of ibuprofen in human skin was also significantly more efficient than other formulations when evaluated in the PAMPA model. The PAMPA model also discriminated between different formulation types (i.e. gel versus solution) compared with other models. Overall, the results confirm the more permeable nature of the PAMPA, silicone membrane and porcine tissue models to ibuprofen compared with human skin. Further finite dose studies to elucidate the effects of individual excipients on the barrier properties of the PAMPA model are needed to expand the applications of this model.

Liposomes loaded and unloaded with ibuprofen and hyaluronic acid were characterized by quasi-elastic light scattering and fluorescence polarization. Optimized liposomes, with and without drugs, were applied onto human skin and the structures formed evaluated using atomic force microscopy.

Encapsulation of drugs into nanoparticles is proposed here as a promising tool for regulating drug crystallization in transdermal patches. The degree of recrystallization and transdermal permeation of ibuprofen and hydrocortisone loaded in polymeric and lipid nanoparticles from matrix-type transdermal patches were investigated. Ethyl cellulose (EC4), poly (lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) were employed for polymeric nanoparticle preparations; while medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and witepsol were used for the preparation of MCT nanoemulsion and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), respectively. As control, similar patches were prepared containing the free form of the investigated model drugs. All nanoparticle-containing transdermal patches exhibited less degree of drug recrystallization after 4 weeks compared to the control groups. Among the investigated nanocarriers, transdermal patches formulated with drug-loaded lipid nanoparticles showed the lowermost degree of recrystallization. Drug encapsulation into SLNs succeeded to reduce the degree of ibuprofen and hydrocortisone recrystallization from 23.3 ± 0.9 and 21.9 ± 1.2% to 0.2 ± 0.1 and 1.8 ± 0.1%, respectively. Additionally, the decreased crystalline fraction was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the drug flux through excised pig skin, which was found to be correlated to the hydrophobicity of the different nanocarriers.

The HFMNs swell by imbibing interstitial skin fluid (ISF), and they facilitate drug transport from the reservoir attached at the base into the skin without polymer dissolution. To develop HFMNs for practical applications, a complete understanding of the drug transport mechanism is required, allowing for controlled TDD and geometrical optimisation. A three-phase system consisting of a reservoir, microneedle, and skin is considered. A mathematical model is developed to incorporate the drug binding within the matrix of the compartment, which was not considered earlier. Super-swelling nature of the HFMNs is incorporated through the swelling ratio obtained experimentally for a polymer. The results are validated with in vitro diffusion studies of ibuprofen sodium (IBU) across excised porcine skin, showing that around 20% of the loaded IBU in lyophilised wafer was delivered in 24 h. It was observed that increasing IBU solubility in reservoir can achieve high drug transport across the skin. The developed model is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

Seven drugs with different physicochemical parameters including clonidine (CLO), flurbiprofen (FLU), diclofenac (DIC), ibuprofen (IBU), zolmitriptan (ZOL), lidocaine (LID), tulobuterol (TUL) and the mixed adhesive (7:3, w/w) of Oppanol® B 15 N (M.W. = 108,000 Da) and Oppanol® N 50 (M.W. = 565,000 Da) were selected for in vitro drug release and skin permeation studies. Regression analysis was used to study the relationship between physicochemical parameters and release behaviors. The release behaviors of drugs were a negative correlation with polarizability and dipole moment per molecular volume (μ/V), which represented van der Waals and dipole-dipole interaction, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and molecular dynamics simulation were used to provide molecular details of the interaction between the drug and PIB. The free volume and molecular mobility of PIB were characterized using mechanical property tests, rheology study, MDSC and molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the above results, drugs with high polarizability and μ/V had stronger van der Waals and dipole-dipole interaction with PIB, reducing the free volume and molecular mobility of PIB, so that the drug struggled to release from PIB. In addition, the diffusion activation energy of the drug was calculated by using the variable temperature release study to characterize the ease of drug release from the kinetic aspect. And the trends of in vitro drug release and skin penetration profiles were basically similar. Thus, it was thought that the physicochemical parameters of the drug played a vital role in the drug release behavior of PIB PSAs and would affect the skin penetration process, which provided a reference for the design and application of patches based on PIB PSAs in TDDS.",2023,,"Ding D, Liu C, Zhang Y, Xu W, Cai Y, Zhong T, Fang L.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2022.122416,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"[""Details on ibuprofen's release mechanism"", 'Quantitative data on permeation rates', 'Comparative analysis with other drugs', 'Formulation specifics of PIB PSA']","The abstract discusses in vitro release behaviors of ibuprofen from a polyisobutylene matrix, indicating it has relevant formulation and measurable endpoints related to permeation.

Among the existing 3D printing techniques, direct powder extrusion (DPE) resulted as the most practical approach thanks to the possibility to directly process excipients and drugs in a single step. The main goal of this work was to determine whether different grades of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer might be employed as new feedstock materials for the DPE technique to manufacture transdermal patches. By selecting two model drugs with different thermal behavior, (i.e., ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium) we also wanted to pay attention to the versatility of EVA excipient in preparing patches for customized transdermal therapies. EVA was combined with 30 % (w/w) of each model drugs. The physicochemical composition of the printed devices was investigated through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analyses. FT-IR spectra confirmed that the starting materials were effectively incorporated into the final formulation, and thermal analyses demonstrated that the extrusion process altered the crystalline morphology of the raw polymers inducing the formation of crystals at lower thicknesses. Lastly, the drug release and permeation profile of the printed systems was evaluated for 48 h and showed to be dependent on the VA content of the EVA grade (74.5 % of ibuprofen released from EVA 4030AC matrix and 12.6 % of diclofenac sodium released from EVA1821A matrix). Hence, this study demonstrated that EVA and direct powder extrusion technique could be promising tools for manufacturing transdermal patches.

Inkjet printing and micromolding are established methods for the production of microneedle array patches and both were used to combine lisinopril embedded in povidone and ibuprofen in Eudragit® RS / RL in a single patch. Dissolution studies, visual inspection, mechanical strength and insertion into an artificial skin membrane model were investigated. A clear spatial separation of the polymers / drugs was observed. Microneedle array patches containing povidone and Eudragit® RS / RL showed a height reduction below 10 %. 97.14 ± 3.76 % of the microneedles made of povidone and Eudragit® RS and 97.50 ± 2.13 % made of povidone and Eudragit® RL pierced the second layer of Parafilm® M.

Traditionally, formulation development relies on empirical knowledge and trial-and-error experiments. In this paper, we introduced the Bayesian optimisation method and compared it with the traditional response surface methodology (RSM) for topical drug formulation. The objective was to optimise the formulation composition of ibuprofen gel-like to achieve a maximum flux through in vitro permeation tests (IVPTs). As a model system, poloxamer 407, ethanol, and propylene glycol (PG) were selected as the key excipients, whose concentrations were optimised. Strat-M membrane, serving as a surrogate for human skin, and Franz cell diffusion were employed in IVPTs. Two sets of experiments were conducted under identical conditions for 30 h. Under the RSM approach, the optimised ibuprofen gel-like formulation was identified with a poloxamer 407: ethanol: PG ratio of 20:20:10, achieving a measured permeation flux of 11.28 ± 0.35 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. In comparison, Bayesian optimisation, after four iterations, yielded an optimised formulation with a ratio of 20.95:19.44:12.14, resulting in a permeation flux of 14.15 ± 0.77 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>.

A ""standard experimental set-up"", in which the implants were directly exposed to well agitated phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was used, as well as set-ups, in which the implants were embedded within agarose hydrogels (mimicking living tissue). The gels were exposed to well agitated phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Ibuprofen-loaded implants were prepared by hot melt extrusion. The systems were thoroughly characterized before and during drug release by optical and scanning electron microscopy, gravimetric analysis, pH and solubility measurements as well as gel permeation chromatography. The bulk fluid was either completely or partially replaced by fresh medium at each sampling time point. In all cases, sink conditions were provided in the agitated bulk fluids throughout the experiments. Interestingly, the agarose set-ups did not show any noteworthy impact of the bulk fluid sampling volume on the observed drug release patterns, whereas complete fluid renewal in the ""standard set-up"" led to accelerated drug release. This could be explained by the considerable fragility of the implants once substantial polymer swelling set on, transforming them into PLGA <i>gels</i>: Complete fluid renewal caused partial disintegration and damage of the highly swollen systems, decreasing the lengths of the diffusion pathways for the drug. The mechanical stress is very much reduced at low sampling volumes, or if the implants are embedded within agarose gels.

This study was designed to compare the effects of emulsifiers on the physicochemical properties and <i>in vitro</i> skin performance of SLNs prepared from a binary mixture of Softisan® 378 (S378) and cetyl palmitate (CP) to those of SLNs prepared from only CP and S378.<h4>Experiments</h4>SLNs were prepared from CP, S378, or a binary mixture of CP and S378 (1:1 <i>w</i>/w) as the lipid phase and stabilized with Tego®Care 450 (TG450) or poloxamer 188 (P188) containing 1.0% <i>w</i>/w ibuprofen loading.

In addition, <i>in vitro</i> drug release and permeation through human skin was studied after production and storage at room temperature for 180 days.<h4>Finding</h4>The particle sizes of ibuprofen-loaded SLNs (IBSLNs) stabilized with P188 (IBSLN-P188) were smaller than those of SLNs stabilized with TG450 (IBSLN-TG450) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). After 180 days, the particle sizes of the IBSLNs were slightly increased compared to those at the initial time but were <250 nm. The IBSLN-TG450 sample showed a higher %CI than IBSLN-P188 prepared with similar propotions of CP and S378, and ibuprofen crystals were observed in the IBSLN1-TG450 sample after storage at 4 °C for 180 days. Based on the result of the <i>in vitro</i> release study and the <i>in vitro</i> skin permeation test, the addition of S378 into the CP-matrix modified ibuprofen release and skin permeation both permeated ibuprofen through the epidermis and retained ibuprofen in the epidermis.

Cupping therapy uses a tool to form a vacuum at certain points on the skin.<h4>Objectives</h4>We investigated the mechanism of pain relief caused by cupping therapy in primary dysmenorrhea that is played by cupping therapy in PD. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the cupping method on pain symptoms, changes in PGF2α, PGE, and β-endorphin levels, and uterine morphology in PD.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 35 female rats were divided into five groups (n = 7 rats per group): control, PD, dysmenorrhea treated with dry cupping (DC), dysmenorrhea treated with wet cupping (WC), and dysmenorrhea treated with ibuprofen (IB) as a standard drug. Pain was assessed by measuring the degree of writhing pain. Serum PGF2α, PGE, and β-endorphin levels were evaluated using ELISA. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to examine uterine morphology, such as thickness, vacuolization, and inflammation.<h4>Results</h4>WC had a pain normalization effect comparable to that of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is superior to both types of cupping in reducing the PGF2α/PGE ratio and the PGF2α to β-endorphins ratio. WC and DC have capabilities comparable to those of ibuprofen in improving uterine vacuolization and inflammation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results indicate that WC is more effective than DC in suppressing dysmenorrhea symptoms, modulating the hormone level ratio, and repairing uterine pathology.

Ibuprofen saturated solutions were prepared using 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 M disodium hydrogen phosphate solution (DHP). The solubility of ibuprofen in DHP increased as the molarity of DHP increased. Thus the four saturated solutions of ibuprofen (0.1M-DHP-IBU, 0.2M-DHP-IBU, 0.3M-DHP-IBU and 0.4M-DHP-IBU) have different concentrations of the same drug, and showed same pH (pH 7.0+/-1). The permeability study was also carried out using human epidermis and silastic membrane. Permeation rate of ibuprofen across rat epidermis and human epidermis from 0.4M-DHP-IBU was much greater than from 0.1M-DHP-IBU. The magnitudes of increase in the drug flux were 46.4-fold with rat epidermis and 9.4-fold with human epidermis. Such a great increase in drug flux was not observed with silastic membrane, only 1.4-fold. This suggests that the increased drug flux is likely due to drug-skin interaction and not the increased concentration of ibuprofen per se. Surface tension (ST) measurements of DHP versus ibuprofen concentration showed ST reduction of DHP, from 72 to 27.9 dyn/cm. This is an indication that ibuprofen acted as ionic surfactant and the observed skin permeability enhancement is attributed to disruption of stratum corneum barrier. Results of DSC study supported this assumption. DSC of untreated rat stratum corneum samples showed lipid transitions at 41.9+/-0.0 degrees C (T1), 55.1+/-1.6 degrees C (T(x)), 70.2+/-0.1 degrees C (T2) and 77.5+/-0.1 degrees C (T3), while those pretreated with 0.4M-DHP-IBU did not show the first three lipid transitions. Also, pretreatment of rat epidermis with 0.4M-DHP-IBU enhanced permeation of diclofenac sodium greater than 1250-fold.

However, often during the biodegradation process, these barriers trigger inflammation and cause a foreign body reaction with subsequent decrease in anti-adhesion efficacy. Here, a facile strategy comprising the incorporation of ibuprofen (IBU) into implantable membranes and its sustained release was proposed in order to improve anti-adhesion effects and neurological outcomes, namely to prevent failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). The combination of free IBU and a newly synthetized polymeric prodrug of IBU, namely poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with ester-linked IBU, was successfully used in order to reduce initial burst drug release and provide sustained drug release from fibrous membranes throughout several weeks. Such release profile was shown useful in preventing both acute and chronic inflammation in rats following laminectomy and membrane implantation. Moreover, histological analysis provided evidence of an excellent anti-adhesion effect, while associated neurological deficits were effectively reduced. Furthermore, the assessment of macrophage density, neovascularization, and related gene expression at the lesion site revealed that a sustained anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with the IBU-loaded proposed fibrous membranes. Results suggested that the COX2 pathway plays an important role in the development epidural fibrosis and arachnoiditis.

Local and systemic effects of topically applied compounds can be significantly increased by plant constituents having skin penetration enhancers.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this study, we examined the proposed penetration enhancing properties of spilanthol, an N-alkylamide abundantly present in several Asteraceae plants like Spilanthes acmella L., on three model drugs (caffeine, testosterone and ibuprofen). Moreover, as plants are frequently contaminated with toxic environmental substances, the mutual influence on the transdermal behavior between spilanthol and six model mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fumonisin B1, citrinin, zearalenone, T-2 toxin) was investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Spilanthol exhibits component and concentration dependent penetration enhancing effects. No significant penetration enhancing effect for ibuprofen has been observed, but with increasing spilanthol concentration (from 0 up to 1w/V%), the permeability of caffeine increased, resulting in an enhancing ratio (ER) of 4.60.

No previous reports traced the mechanistic activity of this plant for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in relation to its chemical constituents.<h4>Aim of the study</h4>The present study was designed to substantiate the anti-arthritic potential of S. argel and identification of its secondary metabolites responsible for the action using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The air-dried powder of S. argel was subjected to liquid-liquid fractionation method to yield polar metabolites fraction (PMF) and nonpolar metabolites fraction (NPMF) where the metabolites that represent each fraction were identified using UPLC/HRMS. The in-vitro anti-arthritic effects of both fractions were tested using protein denaturation, membrane stabilization and proteinase inhibition assays, in addition to in-vitro enzyme inhibition assays of COXs, LOX and collagenases. Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model was also established to evaluate their anti-arthritic effects in-vivo at two doses (200 and 400 mg/kg) in compared to the standard ibuprofen (5 mg/kg). Physical changes with hind paw edema and body weight gain as well as the assessment of serum rheumatoid biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers, and the activity of hyaluronidase and β-glucouronidase enzymes were studied. The histopathological study of ankle and knee joints and immunohistochemistry of caspase-3 and TNF-α in joint synovium were also examined.<h4>Results</h4>The PMF significantly (P < 0.05) reduced paw edema, serum rheumatoid markers, pro-inflammatory mediators, degeneration enzymes of cartilage and bone, and oxidative stress biomarkers. Interestingly, flavonoid glycosides and phenolic acids dominated the polar fraction, which showed the promising anti-arthritic activity of Argel compared to the NPMF which was dominated by pregnane glycosides.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Since arthritis is a chronic disease and there are imperative needs for a lifelong treatment with desirable pharmacological action and lower cost than the currently approved synthetic drugs having severe side effects, the PMF of Argel could be used as a potent anti-rheumatic agent.",2021,,"El-Shiekh RA, Salem MA, Salem MA, Mouneir SM, Hassan A, Abdel-Sattar E.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113341,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'In vitro permeation methods', 'Comparison of permeation profiles']","The study focuses on the anti-arthritic effects of Solenostemma argel and its metabolites rather than on ibuprofen directly, thus less relevant to the target dataset.",0.6

Ibuprofen (IBU) represents one of the most widespread pharmaceuticals in surface waters and sediments in spite of the high removal rates occurring in conventional wastewater technologies. To assess the potentiality of phytoremediation in assisting these technologies, the screening of plant species for tolerance and removal ability of pollutants is a very important issue. In this study, the effects of different IBU concentrations on callus cultures of Populus nigra L., a pioneer tree species in the riparian ecosystem, were investigated. Results evidenced a notable tolerance of poplar cells to IBU, especially at high concentrations (IBU 30 mg L(-1)), which even stimulated growth. At this concentration, the ability to withstand IBU was accompanied by inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, reduction of lipid peroxide content and increase of membrane redox activity. Irrespective of initial IBU concentrations, a complete removal of this compound from the growth medium by poplar cells during a subculture occurred. Antioxidative enzyme activities and polyamine content were stimulated by IBU 0.03 mg L(-1), while no effect was found in cells exposed to IBU 30 mg L(-1), except for a decrease of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity.

The membranes were characterized by physicochemical properties including hydrophobicity, surface morphology and PPCPs adsorption with or without the presence of silica fouling to validate the rejection mechanisms of PPCPs. The fouling mechanisms were investigated using the modified Hermia model. It was found that all membranes with silica fouling showed more severe permeate flux decline at low pHs (3 and 5) than at high pHs (8 and 10) by the decomposition of nonionized silica particles to form a dense gel layer on membrane surfaces, which was hard to be removed by backwash. Silica fouling rendered the membrane surface considerably more hydrophilic, and only IBU, TRI and SMZ were adsorbed on membranes. Silica fouling on tight membranes (NF90 and XLE) can promote rejection of most PPCPs because the dense fouling layer could supply membrane with synergistic steric hindrance to reduce the transportation of PPCPs across membrane surface, implying that size exclusion is the dominating mechanism. While for loose NF270, electrostatic repulsion dominates by enhanced rejection of PPCPs as pH increased. Although fouling layer could provide extra steric hindrance for NF270, its effect was overwhelmed by the accompanied cake-enhanced concentration polarization phenomenon (CEOP). CEOP impeded back diffusion of PPCPs into the feed solution, trapped and accumulated PPCPs on membrane surface so as to increase their diffusion across membrane. At all pH levels, intermediate blocking and gel layer formation was the major fouling mechanism for tight and loose membrane, respectively.",2014,,"Lin YL, Chiou JH, Lee CH.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.01.023,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Detailed experimental methods regarding ibuprofen measurement', 'Results specific to ibuprofen permeation', 'Discussion on ibuprofen rejection mechanisms']",The study primarily focuses on membrane fouling and removal efficiency for various pharmaceuticals without specifying in vitro permeation using diffusion cells.

A computational assessment of the mechanism and thermodynamics of the adsorption of 18 most common pharmaceuticals (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, fenofibric acid, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, phenazone, primidone, propranolol, salicylic acid, tramadol) on four different CNMs (pristine/functionalised graphene and carbon nanotube) in two different solvents (water and n-octanol) was provided. We show that the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on pristine CNMs is controlled by dispersion forces, π-interactions and hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand, adsorption on functionalised CNMs is controlled by hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how functionalization of CNM, CNM curvature and background solution properties modulate the intensity of non-covalent interactions and their contribution towards adsorption free energy.

However, little is known about its potential benefits in pain management. While current pharmacologic methods are effective in many cases, the associated side effects can limit their use. Non-pharmacological methods would minimize drug dependence, facilitating a reduction of the opioid burden. Green light therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing chronic pain in humans and rodents. However, its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. In this study, we demonstrate that green light exposure reduced postsurgical hypersensitivity in rats. Moreover, this therapy potentiated the antinociceptive effects of morphine and ibuprofen on mechanical allodynia in male rats. Importantly, in female rats, GLED potentiated the antinociceptive effects of morphine but did not affect that of ibuprofen. We showed that green light increases endogenous opioid levels while lessening synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation. Importantly, this study reveals new insights into how light exposure can affect neuroinflammation and plasticity in both genders. Clinical translation of these results could provide patients with improved pain control and decrease opioid consumption. Given the noninvasive nature of green light, this innovative therapy would be readily implementable in hospitals.

The majority of intercellular lipids are in a solid state at normal humidity (RH) and ambient temperature; however, several studies indicate that a small fraction exist in a fluid state.

A different change in the skin permeability related to the different lipid structures of the extracted lipids was suggested. To increase the knowledge of the specific role of different lipids on skin structure, a selective lipid modification is proposed. This study assess the effect of Ac on skin barrier lipids in-depth. Synchrotron based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR), which is used to study SC lipid organization, revealed a more ordered lipid organization after Ac treatment. In vitro experiments using Franz cells, which were selected to follow the SC barrier function capability, demonstrated that Ac-treated skin retained caffeine and ibuprofen on the SC with very low permeation of both compounds into the deeper skin layers. In vitro transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements revealed the ability of Ac to induce a less water permeated skin.

Their chemical compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The cytotoxicity of the extracted eight EOs on HaCaT cells was measured and compared. Moreover, analyses of cell cycle and cell apoptosis were performed to investigate the cytotoxic mechanism. The transdermal penetration enhancement effects of the extracted eight EOs on ibuprofen were further compared by the modified Franz diffusion cell method.<h4>Results</h4>The most abundant constituents in the extracted eight EOs were determined to be monoterpenes, especially oxygen-containing monoterpenes.

The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices. Therefore, the development of an inhalable formulation with high bioavailability in the lungs was the leitmotiv of our investigation. The hypertonic ibuprofen solution to be nebulized (NIH) presents great relevant characteristics: bactericidal, virucidal, mucolytic and has a known anti-inflammatory property. Bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection. Our preliminary results indicate that the presence of this high ionic strength solution reduces 10 times the amount of ibuprofen necessary to kill bacteria, but also the time to kill 1x10<sup>6</sup> bacteria, from 4 h (in its absence) to only three minutes (in its presence). That was observed using Pseudomona aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia. Also, ""in vitro'' ibuprofen demonstrated virucidal activity against the so-called enveloped virus, a family that includes coronavirus strain (2019-nCoV). We observed too, the markedly reduced local inflammation in the airways after administering NIH lays on its ability to inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase and to markedly diminish reactive oxygen species (ROS). Other investigators also showed the importance of actin in the rapid spread of virus infection. Furthermore, reorganization of the actin filaments is a key step in lung inflammation induced by systemic inflammatory responses caused by SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that the interaction between actin proteins and S1 is involved in the 2019-nCoV infection and pathogenesis. Consequently, the possibility of interfering in this interaction could represent a valid hypothesis for the development of promising therapeutic and prevention strategies.

Translocation of effector proteins by the type III secretion systems depends on close contact between microbial and host cells. Our finding that both the ExoU-producing PA103 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its mutant obtained by deletion of exoU adhered poorly to endothelial cells (EC) led to the hypothesis that, in some cells, the amount of injected toxin may not be enough to induce cell lysis but cells would suffer from a long-term effect of ExoU intoxication. To address this question, cells were exposed to both bacteria for 1 h and then treated with gentamicin-containing medium, to eliminate infecting microorganisms. After 24 h, the percentage of viable EC in PA103-infected cultures was significantly lower than in cultures exposed to the mutant, as determined by the MTT assay. Cell death was not likely to depend on the ExoU lytic activity since cell labeling with propidium iodide was similar in cultures infected with both bacterial strains. Bacterial cytotoxicity was significantly reduced by MAFP, a specific inhibitor of cPLA2 and iPLA2. Since the PLA2 activity on membrane phospholipids generates free fatty acid, including arachidonic acid (AA), we next compared the bacterial ability to release AA from infected EC. PA103 was shown to induce a potent AA release that was inhibited by MAFP. AA oxidation by oxygenases generates eicosanoids, known to induce both cell death and proliferation. However neither inhibitors of cyclooxygenases (ibuprofen) nor lipoxygenases (NDGA) reduced the ExoU toxicity. Since non-enzymatic oxidation of AA generates reactive radicals, we next investigated the PA103 ability to induce oxidative stress in infected cells. FACS analysis of cell labeling with the C-11 fluor probe and with anti-4-hydroxynonel antibody revealed a significant peroxidation of cell membrane lipids. These results, together with our finding that PA103-infected EC death was significantly attenuated by alpha-tocopherol, led to the conclusion that AA-induced oxidative stress may be another mechanism of cell damage in the course of infection by ExoU-producing P. aeruginosa.",2006,,"Saliba AM, de Assis MC, Nishi R, Raymond B, Marques Ede A, Lopes UG, Touqui L, Plotkowski MC.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2005.07.011,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Details on diffusion studies', 'Formulation details of ibuprofen', 'Endpoint measurements related to permeation']","The study focuses on cytotoxicity related to bacterial activity, with no clear relevance to ibuprofen's permeation or formulation.

During the adrenergic stimulation of brown adipocytes, free fatty acids generated from lipolysis activate UCP1 via an unclear interaction. Here, we set out to characterise activator binding to purified UCP1 to clarify the activation process, discern novel activators and the potential to target UCP1.<h4>Methods</h4>We assessed ligand binding to purified UCP1 by protein thermostability shift analysis, which unlike many conventional approaches can inform on the binding of hydrophobic ligands to membrane proteins. A detailed activator interaction analysis and screening approach was carried out, supported by investigations of UCP1 activity in liposomes, isolated brown fat mitochondria and UCP1 expression-controlled cell lines.<h4>Results</h4>We reveal that fatty acids and other activators influence UCP1 through a specific destabilising interaction, behaving as transport substrates that shift the protein to a less stable conformation of a transport cycle. Through the detection of specific stability shifts in screens, we identify novel activators, including the over-the-counter drug ibuprofen, where ligand analysis indicates that UCP1 has a relatively wide structural specificity for interacting molecules. Ibuprofen successfully induced UCP1 activity in liposomes, isolated brown fat mitochondria and UCP1-expressing HEK293 cells but not in cultured brown adipocytes, suggesting drug delivery differs in each cell type.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings clarify the nature of the activator-UCP1 interaction and demonstrate that the targeting of UCP1 in cells by approved drugs is in principle achievable as a therapeutic avenue, but requires variants with more effective delivery in brown adipocytes.",2022,,"Cavalieri R, Hazebroek MK, Cotrim CA, Lee Y, Kunji ERS, Jastroch M, Keipert S, Crichton PG.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2022.101526,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,uncertain,no,uncertain,"['Detailed methods of ibuprofen analysis', 'In vitro permeation specifics', 'Diffusion cell methodologies', 'Formulation details if present']",The abstract discusses UCP1 activation by ibuprofen but does not focus on permeation/release processes relevant to diffusion cells.

In this study, electrospun blend fibers were produced from polyethylene oxide (PEO) and ethyl cellulose (EC) at various compositions to encapsulate a poorly water-soluble drug of ibuprofen (IBP) at 30% loading. Microscopic evaluation showed smooth and defect-free fiber morphologies for blank and IBP-loaded PEO/EC fibers. The average fiber diameters and fiber yields suggested a potential optimization on the blend fiber composition for the electrospun drug-eluting PEO/EC fibers, where the highest average fiber diameter and fiber yield occurred at 50PEO/50EC fiber composition. Surface wettability studies demonstrated the effects on surface hydrophobicity from blend fibers of water-soluble PEO and hydrophobic EC as well as the incorporation of IBP. In addition, blend fibers containing more PEO promoted the water absorption rates through dissolution of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, results from mechanical testing of the blend fibers showed the highest fiber elastic modulus and tensile strength at fiber compositions in between 75PEO/25EC and 50PEO/50EC, corresponding to the average fiber diameter measurements. The in vitro IBP release rates demonstrated a dependence on the EC compositions supported by the surface wettability and water absorption rate studies.

In many reports, NSAIDs have induced apoptosis in a variety of cell lines such as colon cancer cells. On the other hand, more recently a few reports have found that NSAIDs protect against apoptosis. Here we investigate endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells. The aim of this study is to examine the involvement of NSAIDs, in particular diclofenac, on ER-stress-induced apoptosis of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Diclofenac significantly suppressed SH-SY5Y cell death induced by two types of ER-stress-inducing agents: thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and tunicamycin, a glycosylation blocker. Other NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, ibuprofen, aspirin, and ketoprofen, also suppressed ER-stress-induced SH-SY5Y cell death. The dose-dependent anti-apoptotic effect of diclofenac did not correlate with the reduction of prostaglandin release. Administration of prostaglandin E2, which was a primary product of arachidonic metabolism, showed no effects against anti-apoptotic effects produced by diclofenac. Thapsigargin and tunicamycin each significantly activated caspase-3, -9, and -2 in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in SH-SY5Y cells.

Here, we investigated the role of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) in brain phospholipids for neuronal survival. We used organotypic cultures of rat brain hippocampal slices exposed to 40 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation, to study the consequences of experimental ischemia. In [14C]docosahexaenoic acid-labeled cultures, oxygen-glucose deprivation induced significant release of radioactive docosahexaenoic acid. This release could be blocked by the selective inhibitor of the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2, 4-bromoenol lactone (10 microM), when it was added 30 min prior to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Addition of 4-bromoenol lactone at 30 min prior to oxygen-glucose deprivation markedly decreased the neuronal damage induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation. The protective effect was substantially higher in dentate gyrus than in CA1 and CA3 areas. Enrichment of the hippocampal tissue with docosahexaenoic acid by incubation with 10 microM docosahexaenoic acid for 24 h exerted the same neuroprotective effect, which was observed after treatment with 4-bromoenol lactone. In contrast to the 24 h-preincubation, simultaneous addition of docosahexaenoic acid with the onset of oxygen-glucose deprivation had no protective effect. This suggests that incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid into phospholipids is required for the protective effect observed. Then the possible involvement of arachidonic acid metabolism in docosahexaenoic acid-induced neuroprotection was tested. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by ibuprofen produced no change in neuroprotection after 24-h incubation of the hippocampal slices with docosahexaenoic acid. Simultaneous inhibition of Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent phospholipases A2 by treatment with the general phospholipase A2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (3 microM, 30 min prior to oxygen-glucose deprivation) resulted in significant enhancement of the neuroprotective effect in the dentate gyrus, but not in the CA1 and CA3 areas. In summary, the results reported here indicate that docosahexaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid-containing phospholipids provide potent protection against neurodegeneration after hypoxia/hypoglycemia.

In diffuse brain-injured rats, a chronic sensory sensitivity to whisker stimulation models the agitation of TBI survivors and provides anatomical landmarks across the whisker-barrel circuit to evaluate post-traumatic neuropathology. As a consequence of TBI, acute and chronic microglial activation can contribute to degenerative and reparative events underlying post-traumatic morbidity. Here we hypothesize that a temporal sequence of microglial activation states contributes to the circuit pathology responsible for post-traumatic morbidity, and test the hypothesis by examining microglial morphological activation and neuroinflammatory markers for activation states through gene expression and receptor-binding affinity. Adult male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a single moderate midline fluid percussion injury (FPI) or sham injury. Microglial activation was determined by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and receptor autoradiography in the primary somatosensory barrel field (S1BF) and ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus at 7 and 28 days following FPI. Morphological changes indicative of microglial activation, including swollen cell body with thicker, shrunken processes, were evident in S1BF and VPM at 7 and 28 days post-injury. Principally at 7 days post-injury in VPM, general inflammatory gene expression (major histocompatibility complex I, major histocompatibility complex II, translocator protein 18 kDa [TSPO]) is increased above sham level and TSPO gene expression confirmed by receptor autoradiography. Further, CD45, a marker of classical activation, and TGF-βI, an acquired deactivation marker, were elevated significantly above sham at 7 days post-injury. Daily administration of the anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (20mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the expression of these genes. Evidence for alternative activation (arginase 1) was not observed.

Sodium salicylate, a COX-2 inhibitor, can induce tinnitus in high doses. Hyperactivity of DCN neurons is observed in several animal models of tinnitus, including salicylate-induced tinnitus. The DCN presents several forms of endocannabinoid (EC)-dependent synaptic plasticity and COX-2 can also participate in the oxidative degradation of ECs. We recently demonstrated that short-term perfusion of sodium salicylate and other inhibitors of both oxidative and hydrolytic EC degradation did not affect depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a form of EC-dependent short-term synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that prolonged incubation with high doses of sodium salicylate (1.4 mM) enhances DSE of synapses onto glycinergic DCN interneurons but not those innervating glutamatergic DCN fusiform neurons. This effect was not reproduced with lower doses of salicylate (140 µM) or with ibuprofen, another inhibitor of COX-2. This effect was not observed in the presence of AM251, an antagonist/inverse agonist of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, showing that it was dependent on EC release. Finally we demonstrated that incubation with salicylate potentiated the increase in intracellular calcium during the depolarization.

The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen​​​​​​ and worsening of infections.

Both PGHS isoforms are integral membrane proteins and their substrate fatty acids readily partition into membranes, but the impact of phospholipids and lipid membranes on COX catalysis and the actions of COX inhibitors are not well understood. We have characterized the COX kinetics and ibuprofen inhibition of the purified PGHS isoforms in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) with varying acyl chain structure and physical state. PC was found to directly inhibit COX activity, with non-competitive inhibition by PC monomers binding away from the COX active site and competitive inhibition by micellar/bilayer forms of PC due to sequestration of the arachidonate substrate. Competitive inhibition by native membranes was observed in a comparison of COX kinetics in sheep seminal vesicle microsomes before and after solubilization of PGHS-1. PC liposomes significantly increase the inhibitory potency of ibuprofen against both PGHS isoforms without changing the reversible character of ibuprofen action or requiring binding of PGHS to the liposomes.

Previous studies suggest that the activation threshold and magnitude of the HS response may be modified by treatment with arachidonic acid (AA). We analyzed the effect of exogenous AA and its metabolites, PGE(2), LTD(4), and 15-HETE on HSF-1-dependent gene expression in A549 human respiratory epithelial-like cells. When added at 1microM, PGE(2) much more than LTD(4), but not 15-HETE increased activity of a synthetic HSF-1-dependent reporter after HS exposure (42 degrees C for 2h), but had no effect in the absence of HS. Exposing A549 cells to HS stimulated the release of PGE(2) and treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, reduced HS-induced HSF-1-dependent transcription. PGE(2) increased HS-induced HSP72 mRNA and protein expression but EMSA and Western blot analysis failed to show an effect on HSF-1 DNA binding activity or post-translational modification.

Even for early-stage lung cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy yields merely slight increase to patient survival. EF-hand domain-containing protein D2 (EFHD2) has recently been implicated in recurrence of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, we investigated the correlation between EFHD2 and chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High expression of EFHD2 was significantly associated with poor overall survival of NSCLC patients with chemotherapy in in silica analysis. Ectopic EFHD2 overexpression increased cisplatin resistance, whereas EFHD2 knockdown improved chemoresponse. Mechanistically, EFHD2 induced the production of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and in turn the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), consequently activating membrane expression of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) for drug efflux. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen suppressed EFHD2 expression by leading to the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of EFHD2 through a cyclooxygenase (COX)-independent mechanism. Combining ibuprofen with cisplatin enhanced antitumor responsiveness in a murine xenograft model in comparison with the individual treatment.

The membrane composition was optimized on the basis of the in vitro drug diffusion profiles of ibuprofen, propranolol and testosterone chosen as model drugs on the basis of their different diffusion and solubility properties. The data were compared to those obtained using human epidermis. The ATR-FTIR and SEM analyses revealed that CERs were suspended into the regenerated keratin matrix, even if a partial solubilization occurred. It resulted in the membranes being physically stable after exposure to aqueous buffer and/or mineral oil and the fluxes of ibuprofen and propranolol from these vehicles through membranes and human skin were of the same order of magnitude. The best relationship with human epidermis data was obtained with 180 μm-thick membrane containing 1% ceramide III and 1% ceramide VI. The data on the testosterone diffusion were affected by the exposure of the membrane to a water/ethanol solution over a prolonged period of time, indicating that such an organic solvent was able to modify the supermolecular organization of keratin and CERs.

The influence of the operating conditions on the rejection and the permeate flux was evaluated. The operating conditions tested included the transmembrane pressure (5-30 bar); the effect of the feed concentration on the heavy metals rejection (50-200 mg L<sup>-1</sup>); the effect of ionic strength on the diclofenac and ibuprofen rejection (0-10 g L<sup>-1</sup> NaCl) and the volumetric flow rate (5-15 L min<sup>-1</sup>). It has been shown that increasing the transmembrane pressure increases the intensity of the permeate flow and rejection. Drugs rejection also increases with increasing bulk feed flow rates; however, decreases with increasing ionic strength (NaCl concentration in feed).

A new report submitted to the French Medicines Agency in 2024 documented 216 cases of serious bacterial infections (162 with ibuprofen, 54 with ketoprofen) over 4.5 years following the use of NSAIDs for fever or acute pain. This represents about 21% of serious adverse events with ibuprofen (8% with ketoprofen). Streptococcal infections were most common with ibuprofen (62% of serious bacterial infections; 44% with ketoprofen). These streptococcal infections were invasive (97%) and included severe sepsis/toxic shock, pleuropneumopathy, meningitis/meningoencephalitis and necrotizing dermohypodermatitis. Pharmacoepidemiological studies all suggest an association between NSAID exposure and an increased risk of pleuropulmonary complications, with estimated risks ranging from 1.8 to 8. Several mechanistic data also suggest a specific adverse effect on the severity of invasive streptococcal infections through a specific intrinsic effect of NSAIDs on the enhancement of streptococcal diffusion (via vimentin). Experimental studies in animals have also demonstrated this risk, even when NSAIDs are combined with antibiotics. In conclusion, in the presence of a streptococcal infection, whether diagnosed or not, taking an NSAID for fever or acute pain, even for a short time and even in association with an antibiotic, is a risky practice. It encourages the development of a more serious streptococcal infection, not only by delaying management of the infection, but more importantly by promoting the dissemination of the streptococcus.

We recently identified genes important for acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity in a comprehensive screen and our findings suggested that a small set of yeast strains carrying deletions of ubiquitin-related genes can be informative for drug toxicity profiling. In yeast, approximately 20 different deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have been identified, of which only one is essential for viability. We investigated whether the toxicity profile of DUB deletion yeast strains would be informative about the toxicological mode of action of APAP. A set of DUB deletion strains was tested for sensitivity and resistance to a diverse series of compounds, including APAP, quinine, ibuprofen, rapamycin, cycloheximide, cadmium, peroxide and amino acids and a cluster analysis was performed. Most DUB deletion strains showed an altered growth pattern when exposed to these compounds by being either more sensitive or more resistant than WT. Toxicity profiling of the DUB strains revealed a remarkable overlap between the amino acid tyrosine and acetaminophen (APAP), but not its stereoisomer AMAP.

These solutions were spiked with the micropollutants propranolol, ethinylestradiol, ibuprofen, diclofenac and carbamazepine. Among the membranes tested, NF270 showed the best performance with respect to the retention of micropollutants. The optimum retention of micropollutants was obtained at values of around pH 5. At this point, the retention of all micropollutants in non-hydrolysed urine was above 92%, while the corresponding value for the synthetic urine solution was above 73%. From the results, it can be concluded that the retention mechanism is determined by steric and electrostatic effects as well as by the partitioning of the micropollutants in the membrane.

The MBR was operated with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h and a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of 8.6-10 g/L. Standard solutions of ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen were dosed into the synthetic feed of the MBR. Influent and permeate samples were then collected for enantiospecific analysis. The individual (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the three pharmaceuticals were derivatised using a chiral derivatizing agent to form pairs of diastereomers, which could then be separated and analysed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Accurate quantitation of individual enantiomers was undertaken by an isotope dilution process. By comparing the total concentration (as the sum of the two enantiomers) in the MBR influent and permeate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen concentrations were observed to have been reduced as much as 99%, 43% and 68%, respectively. Furthermore, evidence of enantioselective biodegradation was observed for all three pharmaceuticals.

This work investigates abiotic degradation pathways of a particular PPCP, ibuprofen, in the presence of a major mineral component of soil (kaolinite clay), as well as the health effects of the primary compound and its degradation products. Results from these studies showed that the rate and extent of ibuprofen degradation is greatly influenced by the presence of clay particles and solar radiation. In the absence of solar radiation, the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface where surface silanol groups play a key role. In contrast, under solar radiation and in the presence of clay particles, ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions. The decay rates were at least 6-fold higher for irradiated samples compared to those of dark conditions. Toxicity of primary ibuprofen and its secondary residues were tested on three microorganisms: Bacillus megaterium, Pseudoaltermonas atlantica; and algae from the Chlorella genus. The results from the biological assays show that primary PPCP is more toxic than the mixture of secondary products. Overall, however, biological assays carried out using only 4-acetylbenzoic acid, the most abundant secondary product, show a higher toxic effect on algae compared to its parent compound.",2018,,"Rubasinghege G, Gurung R, Rijal H, Maldonado-Torres S, Chan A, Acharya S, Rogelj S, Piyasena M.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.12.016,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Measurement of ibuprofen degradation rates', 'Toxicity assessment methods', 'Specific details on the role of clay in degradation']",The study focuses on degradation and toxicity of ibuprofen rather than its permeation or release characteristics.

Ibu- loaded vesicles were prepared employing ethanol injection technique using three edge activators; Tego® care 450, Cremophor RH 40 and Crodafos™ CES along with Span 60. Entrapment efficiency percentage (EE%), vesicular size and zeta potential were evaluated to select the optimal formulations. In- vitro release study, differential scanning calorimetry, xray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were performed. Selected formulations were incorporated in a hydrogel to assess their in-vivo wound healing efficiency using full-thickness wound model. The vesicles exhibited high EE% (60.6-93.9 %), particle size ranged from 114.8 to 663.5 nm and zeta potential was from -26.2 to -42.3 mV which indicated good stability. In-vitro release pattern was biphasic. In-vivo assessment of wound healing efficacy of selected Ibu-loaded spanlastics disclosed significant reduction of wound size.

Otto achieved highly consistent sample volumes (coefficient of variation, CV = 3.2 %), surpassing the consistency of manual operation (CV = 7.4 %). The amount of MB measured across multiple sampling-refill cycles mirrored the theoretical amount, as well as the amount determined through manual operation. Otto collected up to 100 samples unattended, over 24 h, in an in vitro ibuprofen permeation study. The samples were collected into standard sample vials to integrate seamlessly with downstream analytical equipment.

The effect of ibuprofen on cathepsin D as a marker of lysosomal membrane ""leakiness"" and thromboxane B2 as a marker of platelet activation was evaluated in 44 patients with angina pectoris. Samples of blood analyzed for cathepsin D, thromboxane B2, and lactate were withdrawn from the coronary sinus and brachial artery before and after pacing to 140 beats/min for 4 minutes. Myocardial ischemia was assessed by determination of transmyocardial lactate extraction or production. Ibuprofen (800 mg) or placebo was administered orally 2 hours before cardiac catheterization. Patients were classified into 4 groups on the basis of administration of placebo or ibuprofen and the presence or absence of myocardial ischemia as determined by demonstration of lactate extraction or production after atrial pacing. In patients with lactate extraction, no significant efflux of cathepsin D or thromboxane B2 occurred after pacing. In patients with lactate production given placebo, a 64 +/- 25% increase in the thromboxane B2 level and a 113 +/- 37% increase in cathepsin D activities occurred in the coronary sinus effluent sampled after pacing. In contrast, in patients with comparable coronary artery disease and comparable lactate production who were given ibuprofen, no release of thromboxane B2 (p = 0.05 compared with patients given placebo) or cathepsin D (p less than 0.01 compared with patients given placebo) occurred after pacing-induced ischemia.

The aim of this study was to identify a xenobiotic that induces hypercholeresis by a similar mechanism.<h4>Methods</h4>Five organic acids (sulindac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, and norfloxacin) were infused into rats with biliary fistulas. Biliary recovery, bile flow, and biliary bicarbonate were analyzed. Sulindac transport was further characterized using Tr(-) rats (deficient in mrp2, a canalicular transporter for organic anions), the isolated perfused rat liver, and hepatocyte membrane fractions.<h4>Results</h4>In biliary fistula rats, sulindac was recovered in bile in unconjugated form and induced hypercholeresis of canalicular origin. Other compounds underwent glucuronidation and were not hypercholeretic. In the isolated liver, sulindac had delayed biliary recovery and induced prolonged choleresis, consistent with a cholehepatic circulation. Sulindac was secreted normally in Tr(-) rats, indicating that its canalicular transport did not require mrp2. In the perfused liver, sulindac inhibited cholyltaurine uptake, and when coinfused with cholyltaurine, induced acute cholestasis. With both basolateral and canalicular membrane fractions, sulindac inhibited cholyltaurine transport competitively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sulindac is secreted into bile in unconjugated form by a canalicular bile acid transporter and is absorbed by cholangiocytes, inducing hypercholeresis. At high flux rates, sulindac competitively inhibits canalicular bile salt transport; such inhibition may contribute to the propensity of sulindac to induce cholestasis in patients.",1999,,"Bolder U, Trang NV, Hagey LR, Schteingart CD, Ton-Nu HT, Cerrè C, Elferink RP, Hofmann AF.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0016-5085(99)70356-2,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"[""Details on ibuprofen's permeability"", 'Comparative analysis with sulindac', 'Methodology for diffusion cell experiments']","While ibuprofen is mentioned, the study primarily focuses on sulindac, making it less relevant for immediate review of ibuprofen-related permeation studies.",0.6

Hydrogel-based transdermal formulations were developed with ibuprofen as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Transcutol and sucrose esters were used as biocompatible penetration enhancers. The permeability measurements were performed with ex vivo Franz diffusion cell methods and a newly developed Skin Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assays (PAMPA) model. Franz diffusion measurement is commonly used as a research tool in studies of diffusion through synthetic membranes in vitro or penetration through ex vivo human skin, whereas Skin PAMPA involves recently published artificial membrane-based technology for the fast prediction of skin penetration. It is a 96-well plate-based model with optimized artificial membrane structure containing free fatty acid, cholesterol, and synthetic ceramide analog compounds to mimic the stratum corneum barrier function.

Study into the role of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids.,"This study was designed to evaluate the effect of an exogenous free radical generating system consisting of purine plus xanthine oxidase on the isolated rat heart and in particular to assess the possible contribution of arachidonic acid or its metabolites to toxicity produced by this drug combination. Purine plus xanthine oxidase produced a time-dependent depression in cardiac contractility which was associated with stimulated release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Electron microscopic analysis revealed a distinct separation of the glycocalyx from the sarcolemmal membrane with no apparent intracellular defects. Purine plus xanthine oxidase was a potent stimulus for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6K-PGF1 alpha) synthesis but leukotriene production was undetectable under any condition. Eicosatetraynoic acid, which totally prevents the metabolism of arachidonic acid, accelerated the loss in force and increased LDH release invoked by purine plus xanthine oxidase, but produced no noticeable change in sarcolemmal ultrastructure. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors produced little influence although pretreatment with either acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen decreased contractility toward the end of purine plus xanthine oxidase perfusion. Nordihydroguarietic acid, a purported inhibitor of 5'-lipoxygenase accelerated the loss in force produced by purine plus xanthine oxidase. The nordihydroguarietic acid effects were associated with reduced 6K-PGF1 alpha efflux but LDH release was unaffected. We also examined whether modification of arachidonic acid release through changes in calcium concentration was associated with altered response to purine plus xanthine oxidase. Lowering the calcium concentration to 0.41 mM (from 1.25 mM control) reduced markedly 6K-PGF1 alpha, efflux as well as LDH release. Although the latter is suggestive of protection, hypocalcemic perfusion resulted in a greater loss in force due to free radical generation. Furthermore, cells from these hearts exhibited a greater degree of glycocalyx separation. Increasing the calcium concentration to 2.50 mM produced no further toxic manifestations in the response to purine plus xanthine oxidase, although the release of 6K-PGF1 alpha was increased. Our results suggest complex toxicity induced by an exogenously generated free radical system. The injury produced by this method is restricted to sarcolemmal changes, the latter being dependent on the external calcium concentration. The study further suggests that accumulation of intracellular unesterified arachidonic acid, which may result from peroxidation of membrane lipids, increases tissue injury caused by exogenous free radicals.",1987,,"Basu DK, Karmazyn M.",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-3565(25)39135-4,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details about ibuprofen utilization', 'Measurable endpoints related to drug effects', 'Formulation information of ibuprofen', 'Methodology of drug impact on heart', 'Specifics on the experimental setup']","This study focuses on cardiac toxicity and the role of arachidonic acid, with ibuprofen mentioned but not primarily related to permeation or release.

Twelve indomethacin/ibuprofen-like arylalkanoic acid (AAA) anti-inflammatory drugs alone had no effect on [35S]TBPS binding, or on its inhibition by GABA, but potentiated the GABA-antagonistic effects of the four quinolones. Felbinac (4-biphenylacetic acid) was most potent in this respect (EC50 = 110 nM, together with 5 microM norfloxacin), followed by flurbiprofen > anirolac > metiazinic acid > tolmetin = ketoprofen = fenbufen = indomethacin > fenoprofen > ibuprofen = (+)-naproxen = sulindac. Other anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs, including aspirin, diclofenac, diflunisal, meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid, nambumetone, phenacetin, piroxicam, and phenylbutazone, failed to potentiate the GABA-antagonistic effect of norfloxacin. Felbinac (1 microM) increased the GABA-antagonistic potencies of norfloxacin and enoxacin about 26-fold, while increasing those of ciprofloxacin and pipemidic acid 7-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively. Using subsaturating concentrations of the four quinolones, concentration-response curves for felbinac yielded EC50 values ranging from 110 nM with 5 microM norfloxacin to 1.3 microM with 100 microM pipemidic acid. Three other piperazinoquinolone antibacterial agents (amifloxacin, difloxacin, and fleroxacin) and four nonpiperazinoquinolone anti-bacterial agents (oxolinic acid, cinoxacin, nalidixic acid, and piromidic acid) were much weaker GABA antagonists and were not significantly potentiated by felbinac. All other known GABAA receptor blockers tested, including R 5135, pitrazepin, bicuculline, SR 95531, strychnine, D-tubocurarine, thebaine, securinine, theophylline, and caffeine, were not potentiated by felbinac. Our results suggest that norfloxacin and related piperazinoquinolones, acting at GABAA receptors, may induce a high affinity binding site for indomethacin/ibuprofen-like anti-inflammatory agents (the AAA site) that, when occupied, reciprocally increases the affinities of the quinolones for GABAA receptors.

UVB exposure initially induces an inflammatory response characterized by edema, dermal infiltration of leukocytes, sunburn cell formation, as well as the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression and subsequent increase in the production and release of prostaglandins. This process of inflammation induced by UVB exposure has been linked to tumor formation. Recently, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib, was developed, which inhibits COX-2-induced inflammation without inhibiting the cytoprotective function of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). The present study compared the effects of topical treatment with Celecoxib (a specific COX-2 inhibitor) and Ibuprofen (a nonspecific COX inhibitor) on the acute UVB-induced cutaneous inflammatory response. We show that the specific inhibition of COX-2 effectively reduced many parameters of UVB-mediated inflammation, including edema, dermal neutrophil infiltration and activation, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels and the formation of sunburn cells.

These novel dual drug systems provided significantly enhanced in vitro penetration rates through a model lipophilic barrier membrane compared to conventional individual formulations of each active. Thus, for ibuprofen, drug penetration flux enhancements of three- and 10-fold were observed when compared to an aqueous ibuprofen suspension and a commercial alcohol-based ibuprofen formulation, respectively. Methyl nicotinate penetration rates were shown to be similar for aqueous gels and emulsified systems. Mechanisms explaining these observations are proposed.

A range of ibu:terpene binary mixtures were melted together, cooled, and recrystallised. Composition/melting point phase diagrams were determined by DSC and FT-IR analysis was used to investigated the nature of the interaction. Permeation of ibu across human epidermal membrane from the eutectic system was measured and compared to the flux from a saturated aqueous solution across skin and skin pretreated with the terpenes. The eutectic, i.e. minimum, melting points of these systems ranged from 32 degrees C for ibu:thymol 40:60 (% w/w) to -13 degrees C for ibu:1,8-cineole 40:60 (% w/w) compared to 76 degrees C for ibu alone. FT-IR studies indicated that only the terpenes which formed hydrogen bonds with ibu produced eutectic systems. Each set of ibu:terpene eutectic systems produced a significant (t-test, p = 0.05) increase in flux compared to a saturated aqueous solution applied to untreated and to terpene pretreated skin. For example, ibu:thymol 40:60 (% w/w) produced a flux of 150 micrograms/cm2/h, 5.9 times the flux from a saturated aqueous solution with thymol pretreated skin and 12.7 times the flux from a saturated aqueous solution across non-pretreated skin.

Paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) were determined using von Frey filaments. Ligated rats developed tactile allodynia within 24h, as evidenced by a decrease in PWT in the affected hindpaw (<4 g vs. >15 g control). Sham-operated controls were unchanged from baseline (>15 g). Allodynia was also characterized by a significant increase in the evoked release of PGE(2). Thus, brushing the plantar surface of the affected hindpaw with a cotton-tipped applicator, 5 days postligation, increased the [PGE(2)](dialysate) to 199+/-34% of the prestimulus control period. In contrast, brushing had no detectable effect on release before surgery or in sham-operated animals. Basal release (no brushing) was similar before and after surgery (sham-operated and ligated rats). In a separate group of rats and beginning 2 days after ligation, the acute i.t. injection of S(+)-ibuprofen, SC-51322, SC-236, or SC-560 significantly reversed allodynia (maximum effect=69+/-9, 66+/-6, 57+/-4, 20+/-5%, respectively). R(-)-ibuprofen or vehicle were without effect. The results of this study suggest that: (a). spinal PG synthesis and allodynia-like behaviour are triggered by normally innocuous brushing after spinal nerve ligation; (b). pharmacological disruption of this cascade significantly reverses allodynia; (c).

At 24h, 5.7 microgram cm(-2) EPA and 3.1 microgram cm(-2) DHA permeated when the solute was ibuprofen; 1.4 microgram cm(-2) EPA and 1.0 microgram cm(-2) DHA when ketoprofen was the solute. At 12h, the ketoprofen/ibuprofen ratio of the moles permeated was 0.27, the ratio of EPA permeated simultaneously with ketoprofen and ibuprofen was 0.22 and the ratio of DHA permeated simultaneously with ketoprofen and ibuprofen was 0.24. We believe this is the first time that simultaneous permeation across skin of a solute and its vehicle has been determined purposefully. The data successfully demonstrated that simultaneous permeation of NSAIDs and essential fatty acids, EPA and DHA from a formulation containing fish oil is feasible. In addition, for both NSAIDs, the relative rates of permeation of EPA and DHA, were in proportion to their levels in the fish oil and the permeation rate of either fatty acid was higher when the permeation rate of the solute was greater. This suggested that the greater the rate of permeation of the NSAID, the greater the rate of permeation of the vehicle, and that a solute permeates skin complete with its vehicular solvation cage.

Our research focused on physico-chemical characterization of ternary systems containing ibuprofen lysinate, lecithin and water. The influence of the resulting microstructures on drug release and permeation through excised human stratum corneum was also investigated. Depending on the mixing ratio different physical states (lamellar and hexagonal liquid crystals, micellar solutions, liposomal dispersions and biphasic systems) were determined by gross, polarizing microscopic and small angle-X-ray analysis. A special emphasis was laid upon the storage-induced transformation of liposomal dispersions into mixed micellar solutions and its influence on drug release and permeation. A model for the transformation process is presented. Drug release of the liposomal dispersion (Da=1.1x10-5 cm2/s) and of the identically composed mixed micellar solution (Da=2.9x10-5 cm2/s) was delayed compared with the data of the aqueous drug solution (Da=4.7x10-5 cm2/s). Because of the association of ibuprofen lysinate molecules with phospholipid molecules within the liposomal and the mixed micellar system the share of free ibuprofen lysinate monomers, which can pass through the dialysis membrane in the release experiment, is markedly reduced. The results of permeation experiments of these systems, however, did not correspond to the release data. The permeability of the mixed micellar solution rose after 6 weeks of storage (P=4.2x10-8 cm/s), and almost reached the permeation of the aqueous solution (P=3.9x10-8 cm/s), whereas the permeation of the liposomal dispersion was very slow (P=1.5x10-8 cm/s).

Calcium efflux was estimated with arsenazo III as an indicator and the redox state of NAD(P)H was monitored fluorimetrically at the 366/450 nm excitation/emission wavelength pair. Dipyrone, paracetamol and ibuprofen did not induce calcium efflux even at 1 mM, piroxicam and salicylate were poor inducers, while diclofenac sodium and mefenamic acid were potent inducers releasing calcium even at 20 microM and 10 microM, respectively. In the presence of 10 microM calcium, CsA had no appreciable effect while in the presence of 30 microM calcium it delayed calcium efflux. Oxidation of mitochondrial NAD(P)H, concomitant with calcium efflux and inhibited by CsA, was observed only in the presence of 30 microM calcium.

This new approach facilitates mass transport into the microdialysis probe by inclusion of a complexation agent in the microdialysis perfusion fluid. In these studies, β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) (0.25-2.0 w/v%) was included in the microdialysis perfusion fluid consisting of a Ringer's solution (155 mM NaCl, 4.0 mM KCl, 2.4 mM CaCl(2)). β-CD forms known inclusion complexes with 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid (ibuprofen). Ibuprofen E(d) was significantly enhanced (1.5-2.0 times) through different microdialysis membrane materials. The effect of microdialysis membrane material (polycarbonate/polyether, AN-69, cuprophan), pH, β-CD concentration, and ibuprofen concentration on the E(d) was examined. Only the polycarbonate/polyether membrane was able to give an E(d) greater than 100%. In general, a maximum increase in E(d) was found when 0.5 w/v% β-CD was included in the perfusion fluid.

The current study used an in vitro primary fish gill cell culture system to assess the effect of pH values in the range of 4.5-8.75 on the uptake rates of the base propranolol (pKa 9.42) and the acid ibuprofen (pKa 4.59). The rate-limiting step in the uptake was the diffusive supply flux of the unionized form from the water to the apical membrane, with subsequent rapid transfer across the epithelium. Computed uptake rate based on the unionized fraction best described the uptake of propranolol and ibuprofen over the range of pH values 5-8 and 6-8.75, respectively. For ibuprofen, the computed uptake rate overestimated the uptake below pH 6 where the unionized fraction increased from 4% at pH 6 to 55% at pH 4.5. As the unionized fraction increased, the uptake rate plateaued suggesting a saturation of the transport process. For both drugs, large variations in the uptake occur with only small fluctuations in pH values.

However, these models have mainly been derived based on empirical data for lipophilic neutral compounds and may not predict the uptake of ionizable compounds. The majority of pharmaceuticals are ionizable, and freshwaters can have a range of pH values that affect speciation. In this study, we assessed the uptake of 10 pharmaceuticals (acetazolamide, beclomethasone, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, norethindrone, propranolol, and warfarin) with differing modes of action and physicochemical properties (p K<sub>a</sub>, log S, log D, log K<sub>ow</sub>, molecular weight (MW), and polar surface area (PSA)) by an in vitro primary fish gill cell culture system (FIGCS) for 24 h in artificial freshwater. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) regression was used to determine the molecular descriptors that influence the uptake rates. Ionizable drugs were taken up by FIGCS; a strong positive correlation was observed between log S and the uptake rate, and a negative correlation was observed between p K<sub>a</sub>, log D, and MW and the uptake rate. This approach shows that models can be derived on the basis of the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals and the use of an in vitro gill system to predict the uptake of other compounds.

Cell-free tools used to predict membrane interactions should replicate the molecular organization of the membrane. Microcavity array-supported lipid bilayer (MSLB) platforms are versatile biophysical models of the cell membrane that combine liposome-like membrane fluidity with stability and addressability. We used an MSLB herein to interrogate drug-membrane interactions across seven drugs from different classes, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories: ibuprofen (Ibu) and diclofenac (Dic); antibiotics: rifampicin (Rif), levofloxacin (Levo), and pefloxacin (Pef); and bisphosphonates: alendronate (Ale) and clodronate (Clo). Fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (FLCS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to evaluate the impact of drug on 1,2-dioleyl- sn-glycerophosphocholine and binary bilayers over physiologically relevant drug concentrations. Although FLCS data revealed Ibu, Levo, Pef, Ale, and Clo had no impact on lipid lateral mobility, EIS, which is more sensitive to membrane structural change, indicated modest but significant decreases to membrane resistivity consistent with adsorption but weak penetration of drugs at the membrane. Ale and Clo, evaluated at pH 5.25, did not impact the impedance of the membrane except at concentrations exceeding 4 mM. Conversely, Dic and Rif dramatically altered bilayer fluidity, suggesting their translocation through the bilayer, and EIS data showed that resistivity of the membrane decreased substantially with increasing drug concentration. Capacitance changes to the bilayer in most cases were insignificant. Using a Langmuir-Freundlich model to fit the EIS data, we propose R<sub>sat</sub> as an empirical value that reflects permeation. Overall, the data indicate that Ibu, Levo, and Pef adsorb at the interface of the lipid membrane but Dic and Rif interact strongly, permeating the membrane core modifying the water/ion permeability of the bilayer structure.

Of these advantages, long-acting drug delivery is perhaps the most valuable. Hydrophilic compounds are particularly difficult to deliver for prolonged times. This work investigates the use of poly(caprolactone) (PCL)-based implant coatings as a novel strategy to prolong the delivery of hydrophilic compounds from implantable devices that have been prepared by additive manufacturing (AM). Hollow implants were prepared from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) using fused filament fabrication (FFF) AM and subsequently coated in a PCL-based coating. Coatings were prepared by solution-casting mixtures of differing molecular weights of PCL and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Increasing the proportion of low-molecular-weight PCL up to 60% in the formulations decreased the crystallinity by over 20%, melting temperature by over 4 °C, and water contact angle by over 40°, resulting in an increased degradation rate when compared to pure high-molecular-weight PCL. Addition of 30% PEG to the formulation increased the porosity of the formulation by over 50% when compared to an equivalent PCL-only formulation. These implants demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> release rates for hydrophilic model compounds (methylene blue and ibuprofen sodium) ranging from 0.01 to 34.09 mg/day, depending on the drug used.

The incorporation of additives, such as surfactants, during microneedle fabrication might be an alternative solution to overcome the limited range of materials used in fabricating dissolving MAPs. However, there is a lacuna in the knowledge on the effect of surfactants on the manufacture and performance of dissolving MAPs. The current study explores the role of surfactants in the manufacture and performance of dissolving MAPs fabricated from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) loaded with the model drugs, ibuprofen sodium and itraconazole. Three nonionic surfactants, Lutrol F108, Pluronic F88, and Tween 80, in solutions at varying concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% w/w) were loaded into these dissolving MAPs. It was discovered that all of the dissolving MAPs that incorporated surfactant displayed a lower reduction in the microneedle height (≈10%) relative to the control formulation (≈20%) when subjected to a compressive force of 32 N. In addition, the incorporation of surfactants in some instances enhanced the insertion profile of these polymeric MAPs when evaluated using <i>ex vivo</i> neonatal porcine skin. The incorporation of surfactant into ibuprofen sodium-loaded dissolving MAPs improved the insertion depth of MAPs from 400 μm down to 600 μm. However, such enhancement was not apparent when the MAPs were loaded with the model hydrophobic drug, itraconazole. Skin deposition studies highlighted that the incorporation of surfactant enhanced the delivery efficiency of both model drugs, ibuprofen sodium and itraconazole. The incorporation of surfactant enhanced the amount of ibuprofen sodium delivered from 60.61% up to ≈75% with a majority of the drug being delivered across the skin and into the receptor compartment. On the other hand, when surfactants were added into MAPs loaded with the model hydrophobic drug itraconazole, we observed enhancement in intradermal delivery efficiency from 20% up to 30%, although this did not improve the delivery of the drug across the skin. This work highlights that the addition of nonionic surfactant is an alternative formulation strategy worth exploring to improve the performance and delivery efficiency of dissolving MAPs.",2022,,"Anjani QK, Sabri AHB, Utomo E, Domínguez-Robles J, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.1c00988,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed methodology of permeation studies', 'Specific formulations used', 'Exact experimental conditions', 'Results on ibuprofen perfusion rates']","The study focuses on ibuprofen sodium delivery through dissolving MAPs with surfactants, relevant for in vitro permeation studies.

The study aim was to investigate the role of secondary cytotoxic effect in a macrophage-lung cancer coculture model after nanoparticle treatment in the presence and absence of anti-inflammatory drugs. An in vitro coculture model composed of confluent alveolar macrophage MH-S and A-549 lung cancer cells separated by a 0.4 μm porous membrane was used in the study. Macrophages were treated with two sizes of gelatin nanoparticles and two sizes of poly(isobutyl cyanoacrylate) (PIBCA) nanoparticles, with and without doxorubicin as a chemotherapeutic drug. The treatment effect with and without the presence of anti-inflammatory drug was studied using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The model drugs were ibuprofen, celecoxib, prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methotrexate. Different nanoparticles in different sizes were synthesized with a range of physicochemical characteristics. Doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles were prepared with an entrapment efficiency of 82-83% for PIBCA and 39-42% for gelatin. Nanoparticle treatment of macrophages showed a secondary cytotoxic effect on A-549 cancer cells at 24 and 36 h, with a drop in cell viability of 40-62%. However, this effect was significantly reduced to 10-48% if the macrophages were exposed to anti-inflammatory drugs. When ibuprofen and celecoxib were used the cell viability rebounded between 24 and 36 h. For prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methotrexate the cell viability dropped further between 24 and 36 h. Macrophages exposed to nanoparticles show secondary cytotoxicity, which has a significant antitumor effect in the microclimate of the coculture model. The beneficial nanoparticle treatment effect was significantly reduced if nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, or methotrexate was given at the same time.

Therefore, multifunctional wound dressings that can modulate these factors to promote wound healing are in high demand. In this work, a multifunctional Janus electrospinning nanofiber dressing with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, controlled release of drugs, and unidirectional water transport was prepared by depositing coaxial nanofibers on a hydrophilic poly(ε-caprolactone)@polydopamine-ε-polyl-lysine (PCL@PDA-ε-PL) nanofiber membrane.

Among them, LA with a melting point of 43 °C served as a phase change material to control the release of IBU. The phase transition of LA was induced by near-infrared (NIR) irradiation that triggered the photothermal properties of PDA. Moreover, the Janus nanofiber dressing exhibited synergistic antimicrobial properties for <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> due to the photothermal properties of PDA and antibacterial ε-PL.

Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) represents a frequently utilized chemotherapeutic agent for liver cancer patients. Sodium bicarbonate (SB) serves to neutralize the acidic tumor microenvironment, while ibuprofen (IBU) attenuates inflammatory factor production. The combination of these three commonly used drugs facilitates antitumor efficacy and relapse prevention. Composite fibrous membranes were prepared by incorporating the antitumor drug DOX into MSN, which was then codispersed with IBU in a poly l-lactic acid (PLLA) electrospinning solution after acid sensitization using SB.

However, mounting evidence suggests that their pharmacology extends beyond this canonical pathway. In this study, the potential of NSAIDs to modulate human acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme linking neuroinflammation, metabolic dysfunction and degenerative diseases, was evaluated. An integrative strategy combining silicon and vitro approaches was employed. Structure-based molecular docking using GOLD, molecular dynamics simulations with AMBER21, and MM-GBSA free energy calculations were performed to assess binding stability and energetic favorability. Among the compounds that were tested, nimesulide displayed the highest binding affinity (Δ<i>G</i> = -24.2 kcal/mol), followed by dipyrone (-16.0 kcal/mol), ibuprofen (-11.0 kcal/mol), and paracetamol (-9.0 kcal/mol). The per-residue energy decomposition revealed the involvement of aromatic and polar residues in the catalytic gorge, displaying interaction patterns analogous to those of classical AChE inhibitors. Experimental enzymatic assays corroborated these predictions, demonstrating a dose-dependent inhibition of AChE activity by nimesulide at micromolar concentrations. These findings suggest that NSAIDs, particularly nimesulide, may act as dual modulators with both anti-inflammatory and cholinergic regulatory effects.

The system is similar to a related gelator system we had studied previously, but we were unable to apply the same gelling procedure because of the instability of the colloid caused by the small structural modification (length of the alkyl chain in the bis-imidazolium head group). This situation holds true for the gels formed with varying compositions and under different conditions (gelator/drug ratio, solvent proportion, and flow rates), with the most significant differences being the improved gel rheology and slower drug release rates. Very importantly, the gels (based on a previously unexplored system) have a higher water content ratio (water/EtOH 4:1) than others in the family, making their medicinal application more attractive. The gels were characterized by a variety of microscopy techniques, X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, and rheology. Salts of the antiinflammatory drugs ibuprofen and indomethacin were successfully incorporated into the gels. The diffraction experiments indicate that these composite gels with relatively short alkyl chains in the gelator component contrast to previous systems, in that they exhibit structural order and the presence of crystalline areas of the drug molecule implying partial phase separation (even though these drug crystallites are not discernible by microscopy). Furthermore, the release study with the gel incorporating ibuprofenate showed promising results that indicate a possible drug delivery vehicle application for this and related systems.",2017,,"Sathyanarayanan G, Rodrigues M, Limón D, Rodriguez-Trujillo R, Puigmartí-Luis J, Pérez-García L, Amabilino DB.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.7b01800,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,both,yes,yes,uncertain,"['detailed formulation information', 'specific release rates of ibuprofen', 'methods of permeation studies', 'comparison with conventional methods', 'stability of the gels under various conditions']","This study investigates the drug release profile of ibuprofen incorporated into gels using a microfluidic approach, indicating the relevance to permeation studies.

In this work, a combined experimental and computational investigation of the main structural and physicochemical parameters driving drug adsorption/desorption kinetics was carried out. Two model drugs (aspirin and ibuprofen) and three water-stable, biocompatible MOFs (MIL-100(Fe), UiO-66(Zr), and MIL-127(Fe)) have been selected to obtain a variety of drug-matrix couples with different structural and physicochemical characteristics. This study evidenced that the drug-loading and drug-delivery processes are mainly governed by structural parameters (accessibility of the framework and drug volume) as well as the MOF/drug hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. As a result, the delivery of the drug under simulated cutaneous conditions (aqueous media at 37 °C) demonstrated that these systems fulfill the requirements to be used as topical drug-delivery systems, such as released payload between 1 and 7 days.

Both pristine and functionalized Zr-DASDCAs, together with activated carbon, were used as a potential carrier for ibuprofen (IBU) storage and delivery. Zr-DASDCAs, especially the modified ones (OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA), showed competitive results in IBU delivery. Specifically, the release rate in phosphate-buffered saline solution at pH 7.4 was nearly constant (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.98) for up to 10 days, which would be very effective in IBU dosing to the human body. Moreover, the release rate could be controlled by changing the pH of the releasing solution. The rate of IBU release from both pristine and modified Zr-DASDCAs at pH 7.4 and 3.0 was also explained with a few interactions such as H-bonding and electrostatic repulsion, together with the relative pore size of the Zr-DASDCAs. Therefore, the results suggested that functionalization of MOFs via postsynthetic modification, especially with OC and TC, to introduce various functional groups onto MOFs is an effective approach to not only reducing the release rate of IBU but also inducing a constant release of IBU for as long as 10 days.",2019,,"Sarker M, Shin S, Jhung SH.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b01139,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on the diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics on the ibuprofen formulation', 'Data on release kinetics', 'Comparative results of modified vs. pristine Zr-DASDCA', 'Methodology for measuring release rates']","The study evaluates a metal-organic framework for ibuprofen delivery, suggesting potential relevance for diffusion studies.

Here, we studied two types of Fe-MOFs: MIL-53 and MIL-88B, for in vitro drug loading and releasing of ibuprofen as a model drug. Both Fe-MOFs are based on the same iron clusters and organic ligands but form different crystal structures as a result of two different nucleation pathways. The MIL-53 structure demonstrates one-dimensional channels, while MIL-88B exhibits a three-dimensional cage structure. Our studies show that MIL-53 adsorbs more ibuprofen (37.0 wt %) compared to MIL-88B (19.5 wt %). A controlled drug release was observed in both materials with a slower elution pattern in the case of the ibuprofen-encapsulated MIL-88B. This indicates that a complex cage structure of MIL-88 is beneficial to control the rate of drug release. A linear correlation was found between cumulative drug release and the degree of material degradation, suggesting the biodegradation of Fe-MILs as the main drug elution mechanism. The cytotoxicity of MIL-88B was evaluated in vitro with NIH-3T3 Swiss mouse fibroblasts, and it shows that MIL-88B has no adverse effects on cell viability up to 0.1 mg/mL. This low toxicity was attributed to the morphology of MIL-88B nanocrystals. The very low toxicity and controlled drug release behavior of Fe-MIL-88B suggest that better materials for drug-delivery applications can be created by controlling not only the composition but also the crystal structure and nanoparticle morphology of the material.",2020,,"Pham H, Ramos K, Sua A, Acuna J, Slowinska K, Nguyen T, Bui A, Weber MDR, Tian F.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03696,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology of ibuprofen loading and release', 'Quantitative data on permeation rates', 'Chemical characterization of formulations', 'Comparison with other drug delivery systems', 'In vitro study conditions and parameters']","The study focuses on ibuprofen release using iron-based metal-organic frameworks, making it directly relevant for the dataset on drug permeation.

MED,15926557,15926557.0,10.1021/es048590e,In vitro assessment of modes of toxic action of pharmaceuticals in aquatic life.,"An ecotoxicological test battery based on a mode-of-action approach was designed and applied to the hazard identification and classification of modes of action of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, ethinyl estradiol, ibuprofen, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole). The rationale behind the design of the battery was to cover the relevant interactions that a compound may have with biological targets. It is thus not comprehensive but contains representative examples of each category of mode of toxic action including nonspecific, specific, and reactive toxicity. The test battery consists of one test system for nonspecific toxicity (baseline toxicity or narcosis), two test systems for specific effects, and two test systems for reactive toxicity. The baseline toxicity was quantified with the Kinspec test, which detects membrane leakage via measurements of membrane potential. This test system may also be used to detect the specific effects on energy transduction, although this was not relevant to any compound investigated in this study. As examples of specific receptor-mediated toxicity, we chose the yeast estrogen screen (YES) as a specific test for estrogenicity, and the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence in algae to assess specific effects on photosynthesis. Reactive modes of action were assessed indirectly by measuring the relevance of cellular defense systems. Differences in growth inhibition curves between a mutant of Escherichia coli that could not synthesize glutathione and its parent strain indicate the relevance of conjugation with glutathione as a defense mechanism, which is an indirect indicator of protein damage. DNA damage was assessed by comparing the growth inhibition in a strain that lacks various DNA repair systems with that in its competent parent strain. Most compounds acted merely as baseline toxicants in all test systems. As expected, ethinylestradiol was the only compound showing estrogenic activity. Propranolol was baseline-toxic in all test systems exceptforthe photosynthesis inhibition assay, where it surprisingly showed a 100-fold excess toxicity over the predicted baseline effect. The exact mode of toxic action could not be confirmed, but additional chlorophyll fluorescence induction experiments excluded the possibility of direct interference with photosynthesis through photosystem II inhibition. Mixture experiments were performed as a diagnostic tool to analyze the mode of toxic action. Compounds with the same mode of toxic action showed the expected concentration addition. In the photosynthesis inhibition assay, agreement between experimental results and prediction was best for two-stage predictions considering the assigned modes of action. In a two-stage prediction, concentration addition was used as a model to predict the mixture effect of the baseline toxicants followed by their independent action as a single component combined with the specifically acting compound propranolol and the reference compound diuron. A comparison with acute toxicity data for algae, daphnia, and fish showed generally good agreement for the nonspecifically acting compounds but also that the proposed test battery offered better diagnostic value in the case of the specifically acting compounds.",2005,,"Escher BI, Bramaz N, Eggen RI, Richter M.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es048590e,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"[""Details on ibuprofen's specific modes of action"", 'Any formulations used for ibuprofen during testing', ""Quantitative results regarding ibuprofen's toxicity"", 'Potential comparisons with permeation studies']","The study focuses on the toxicological assessment of various pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen, rather than in vitro permeation using diffusion cells.

In a continuously operated process, the nutrients were concentrated up to a factor of 3.2. The concentration factor was limited by water transport across the membrane. Water transport was caused by osmosis and electroosmosis, and a model was developed to describe these phenomena. The removal of several spiked micropollutants was investigated in continuous electrodialysis experiments. Ethinylestradiol was removed completely during the whole operating period. Diclofenac and carbamazepine were initially retained, but limited permeation (5-10%) occurred after longer operating times (90 days). Retentions of propranolol and ibuprofen were also high initially, but substantial breakthroughs occurred during extended operation. Considerable adsorption on the membranes was observed for all compounds. The permeation mechanism of several compounds appears to depend on the adsorbed amount on the membrane, which indicates that partitioning and diffusion mechanisms play an important role in the permeation transport. Partial desorption occurred in leaching experiments with polarity reversal, and almost quantitative desorption was observed after incubation of the membranes with Filter Count Gel Solution. Because environmental concentrations are much lower than the concentrations spiked here, it can be anticipated that operation without significant permeation is possible in practice during extended periods of time.",2006,,"Pronk W, Biebow M, Boller M.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es051921i,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen permeation data', 'Methodology of diffusion cell use', 'Specific conditions for ibuprofen', 'Comparative results with other compounds']","The abstract discusses various compounds including ibuprofen in the context of electrodialysis, but it does not focus on in vitro permeation using diffusion cells, making it less relevant for the dataset.",0.6

In this study, we demonstrated the application of a novel, fast, and cost-effective quantitative toxicogenomics-based approach for the evaluation of the evolution and nature of toxicity along the electro-Fenton oxidative degradation of three representative CECs whose oxidative degradation pathways have been relatively well studied, bisphenol A, triclosan, and ibuprofen. The evolution of toxicity as a result of the transformation of parent chemicals and production of intermediates during the course of degradation are monitored, and the quantitative toxicogenomics assay results revealed the dynamic toxicity changes and mechanisms, as well as their association with identified intermediates during the electro-Fenton oxidation process of the selected CECs. Although for the three CECs, a majority (>75%) of the parent compounds disappeared at the 15 min reaction time, the nearly complete elimination of toxicity required a minimal 30 min reaction time, and they seem to correspond to the disappearance of identified aromatic intermediates. Bisphenol A led to a wide range of stress responses, and some identified transformation products containing phenolic or quinone group, such as 1,4-benzoquinone and hydroquinone, likely contributed to the transit toxicity exhibited as DNA stress (genotoxicity) and membrane stress during the degradation. Triclosan is known to cause severe oxidative stress, and although the oxidative damage potential decreased concomitantly with the disappearance of triclosan after a 15 min reaction, the sustained toxicity associated with both membrane and protein stress was likely attributed at least partially to the production of 2,4-dichlorophenol that is known to cause the production of abnormal proteins and affect the cell membrane. Ibuprofen affects the cell transporter function and exhibited significantly high membrane stress related to both membrane structure and function. Oxidative degradation of ibuprofen led to a shift in its toxicity profile from mainly membrane stress to one that exhibited not only sustained membrane stress but also protein stress and DNA stress. The information-rich and high-resolution toxicogenomics results served as ""fingerprints"" that discerned and revealed the toxicity mechanism at the molecular level among the CECs and their oxidation transformation products. This study demonstrated that the quantitative toxicogenomics assay can serve as a useful tool for remediation technology efficacy assessment and provide guidance about process design and optimization for desired toxicity elimination and risk reduction.",2014,,"Gou N, Yuan S, Lan J, Gao C, Alshawabkeh AN, Gu AZ.",https://doi.org/10.1021/es501222t,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,yes,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Detailed methods on ibuprofen measurement', 'Toxicity assessment results specific to ibuprofen', 'Specific intermediate products formed during ibuprofen degradation']","The abstract mentions ibuprofen, but it focuses on the toxicity of transformation products rather than in vitro permeation or release.

The separation and release behavior of low molecular weight anionic molecules (i.e., ibuprofen, rose bengal, and acid red 8) by/from the multilayer nanotubes were studied because these tubes could potentially be used as separation or targeted delivery vehicles. The magnetic tubes could be successfully used to separate (or remove) a high concentration of dye molecules (i.e., rose bengal) from solution by activating the nanotubes in acidic solution.

Two new KTP derivatives, IBP-KTP (IbKTP-OH) and IBP-KTP-amide (IbKTP-NH(2)), were synthesized and characterized for membrane interaction, analgesic activity and mechanism of action.

Within this model study the impact of the matrix material on the film forming properties of ibuprofen-matrix composite films is investigated. As matrix materials polystyrene, methyl cellulose, or hydroxyl-ethyl cellulose were used. The film properties were either varied by the preparation route, i.e., spin coating or drop casting, or via changes in the relative ratio of the ibuprofen and the matrix material. The resulting films were investigated via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscope experiments. The results show that preferred (100) textures can be induced via spin coating with respect to the glass surface, while the drop casting results in a powder-like behavior. The morphologies of the films are strongly impacted by the ibuprofen amount rather than the preparation method. A comparison of the various matrix materials in terms of their impact on the dissolution properties show a two times faster zero order release from methyl cellulose matrix compared to a polystyrene matrix.

The swelling behavior in hydrated medium and the controlled release from hydrophilic copolymers of the NSAIDs derivatives and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, HEMA, are discussed, considering the hydrolytical reactivity of the acrylamide or acrylic ester functional groups, the aromatic or aliphatic structure of the spacer side groups, and the hydrophilic character of the copolymer systems. The results obtained demonstrated that the swelling degree of copolymers depends on the average composition of copolymers, decreasing with the increase of the average fraction of the corresponding acrylic derivative of ibuprofen or ketoprofen in the copolymer system. In addition, polymers which support the NSAIDs active component through aromatic amide links, are more sensitive to hydrolytical processes than those of alkyl ester functions.

A diffusion cell was modified so ultrasound could be applied to the vehicle and skin. Since ultrasound can increase the temperature underneath the area of application, control representing temperature effects ran concurrently to the ultrasound experiment. The results demonstrate that ultrasound can increase the penetration of ibuprofen through human skin.

Thus, the pharmacological manipulation of Hsp70 levels in cancer cells may be an effective means of preventing the progression of tumours. We found that the downregulation of Hsp70 by ibuprofen in vitro enhances the antitumoural activity of cisplatin in lung cancer. Ibuprofen prominently suppressed the expression of Hsp70 in A549 cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and sensitized them to cisplatin in association with an increase in the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, whereas ibuprofen alone did not induce cell death. The cisplatin-dependent events occurring up- and downstream of mitochondrial disruption were accelerated by treatment with ibuprofen. The increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis caused by the depletion of Hsp70 by RNA interference is evidence that the increased apoptosis by ibuprofen is mediated by its effect on Hsp70. Our observations indicate that the suppression of Hsp70 by ibuprofen mediates the sensitivity to cisplatin by enhancing apoptosis at several stages of the mitochondrial cascade. Ibuprofen, therefore, is a potential therapeutic agent that might allow lowering the doses of cisplatin and limiting the many challenge associated with its toxicity and development of drug resistance.",2014,,"Endo H, Yano M, Okumura Y, Kido H.",https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2013.550,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Methodology for ibuprofen application', 'In vitro diffusion/release setup', 'Cell models used in the study', 'Endpoint measurements related to permeation']","This study focuses on the anticancer effects of ibuprofen in lung cancer cells, rather than its permeation characteristics in diffusion cells.

However, agents that can topically induce PGD(2) for itch relief are not well established. The antimycotic sertaconazole nitrate (STZ) has been shown to exhibit anti-itch properties; however, the mechanism for this activity has not been elucidated. STZ mitigated degranulation of RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia) mast cells induced by compound 48/80, a pruritogenic agent known to promote the release of histamine, and augmented PGD(2) production in mast cells and macrophages. Addition of exogenous PGD(2) abrogated compound 48/80-induced degranulation by acting through the prostanoid D receptor 1 (DP1). STZ induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in mast cells and a pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, resulted in the attenuation of PGD(2) levels. Finally, in a murine model of pruritus, the scratching behavior induced by compound 48/80 was mitigated by topical application of STZ. This effect was reversed by the addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, or a DP1 receptor antagonist (MK0524). Collectively, these results suggest that STZ mediates its anti-itch effects by boosting the antipruritic agent, PGD(2), by the activation of the p38-MAPK pathway.

MED,27362232,27362232.0,10.1038/nature18615,Toremifene interacts with and destabilizes the Ebola virus glycoprotein.,"Ebola viruses (EBOVs) are responsible for repeated outbreaks of fatal infections, including the recent deadly epidemic in West Africa. There are currently no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines for the disease. EBOV has a membrane envelope decorated by trimers of a glycoprotein (GP, cleaved by furin to form GP1 and GP2 subunits), which is solely responsible for host cell attachment, endosomal entry and membrane fusion. GP is thus a primary target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here we report the first, to our knowledge, unliganded structure of EBOV GP, and high-resolution complexes of GP with the anticancer drug toremifene and the painkiller ibuprofen. The high-resolution apo structure gives a more complete and accurate picture of the molecule, and allows conformational changes introduced by antibody and receptor binding to be deciphered. Unexpectedly, both toremifene and ibuprofen bind in a cavity between the attachment (GP1) and fusion (GP2) subunits at the entrance to a large tunnel that links with equivalent tunnels from the other monomers of the trimer at the three-fold axis. Protein–drug interactions with both GP1 and GP2 are predominately hydrophobic. Residues lining the binding site are highly conserved among filoviruses except Marburg virus (MARV), suggesting that MARV may not bind these drugs. Thermal shift assays show up to a 14 °C decrease in the protein melting temperature after toremifene binding, while ibuprofen has only a marginal effect and is a less potent inhibitor. These results suggest that inhibitor binding destabilizes GP and triggers premature release of GP2, thereby preventing fusion between the viral and endosome membranes. Thus, these complex structures reveal the mechanism of inhibition and may guide the development of more powerful anti-EBOV drugs.",2016,,"Zhao Y, Ren J, Harlos K, Jones DM, Zeltina A, Bowden TA, Padilla-Parra S, Fry EE, Stuart DI.",https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/644ac505-33f2-4705-b9ee-f0858c20c968,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"[""Details on ibuprofen's concentration"", ""Data on ibuprofen's release/permeation"", 'Experimental conditions related to diffusion cells']","The study discusses ibuprofen in a context unrelated to in vitro permeation or release.

Considering the high abundance of cell-free DNA encoding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in both clinical and environmental settings, natural transformation is an important horizontal gene transfer pathway to transmit antibiotic resistance. It is acknowledged that antibiotics are key drivers for disseminating antibiotic resistance, yet the contributions of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals on transformation of ARGs are overlooked. In this study, we report that some commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, at clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly facilitated the spread of antibiotic resistance through the uptake of exogenous ARGs. This included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, the lipid-lowering drug, gemfibrozil, and the β-blocker propranolol. Based on the results of flow cytometry, whole-genome RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis, the enhanced transformation of ARGs was affiliated with promoted bacterial competence, enhanced stress levels, over-produced reactive oxygen species and increased cell membrane permeability. In addition, a mathematical model was proposed and calibrated to predict the dynamics of transformation during exposure to non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals.

The use of antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations has been recognized as an important factor in disseminating antibiotic resistance via horizontal gene transfer. Although non-antibiotic, human-targeted pharmaceuticals are widely used by society (95% of the pharmaceuticals market), the potential contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance is not clear. Here, we report that commonly consumed, non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), a lipid-lowering drug (gemfibrozil), and a β-blocker (propranolol), at clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly accelerated the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via plasmid-borne bacterial conjugation. Various indicators were used to study the bacterial response to these drugs, including monitoring reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell membrane permeability by flow cytometry, cell arrangement, and whole-genome RNA and protein sequencing. Enhanced conjugation correlated well with increased production of ROS and cell membrane permeability. Additionally, these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals induced responses similar to those detected when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, such as inducing the SOS response and enhancing efflux pumps.

In this study, we investigated the role of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in chronic pain-induced persistent anxiety in mice and explored potential drug targets. Chronic inflammatory pain was induced in mice by bilateral injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the planta of the hind paws; anxiety-like behaviours were assessed with behavioural tests; S-nitrosylation and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission were examined using biochemical assays and electrophysiological recordings, respectively. We found that CFA induced persistent upregulation of AMPAR membrane expression and function in the vmPFC of anxious mice but not in the vmPFC of non-anxious mice. The anxious mice exhibited higher S-nitrosylation of stargazin (an AMPAR-interacting protein) in the vmPFC. Inhibition of S-nitrosylation by bilaterally infusing an exogenous stargazin (C302S) mutant into the vmPFC rescued the surface expression of GluA1 and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission as well as the anxiety-like behaviours in CFA-injected mice, even after ibuprofen treatment. Moreover, administration of ZL006, a small molecular inhibitor disrupting the interaction of nNOS and PSD-95 (20 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, for 5 days, i.p.), significantly reduced nitric oxide production and S-nitrosylation of AMPAR-interacting proteins in the vmPFC, resulting in anxiolytic-like effects in anxious mice after ibuprofen treatment. We conclude that S-nitrosylation is necessary for AMPAR trafficking and function in the vmPFC under chronic inflammatory pain-induced persistent anxiety conditions, and nNOS-PSD-95 inhibitors could be potential anxiolytics specific for chronic inflammatory pain-induced persistent anxiety after analgesic treatment.",2023,,"Chen ZJ, Su CW, Xiong S, Li T, Liang HY, Lin YH, Chang L, Wu HY, Li F, Zhu DY, Luo CX.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-022-01024-z,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Drug formulation details', 'In vitro methods used', 'Endpoint measurements for ibuprofen', 'Details on the Franz diffusion cell methodology']",The study focuses on the molecular mechanisms of chronic pain and anxiety rather than on drug permeation or formulation specifics.

Resistance mechanisms, such as target site modification, efflux pumps, and porin loss, necessitate alternative strategies, including the use of non-antibiotic adjuvants.

Clinical E. coli strains were exposed to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, ampicillin) with or without NSAIDs (acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen). Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed via disk diffusion, while minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (MICs/MBCs) were determined to quantify interactions. Membrane integrity was evaluated through cytoplasmic contents release assays. NSAIDs significantly enhanced antibiotic susceptibility, reducing MICs/MBCs in most strains. Membrane leakage assays demonstrated increased release of intracellular components, suggesting compromised membrane integrity.

The cation channel, TRPV1, mediated heat hyperalgesia as a distinct pain modality. Three classes of PFTs-alpha-hemolysin (Hla), phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), and the leukocidin HlgAB-directly induced neuronal firing and produced spontaneous pain.

Loss-of-function mutations of vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) gene (AVPR2) is the most common cause of the disease. We have identified five novel mutations L86P, R113Q, C192S, M272R, and W323_I324insR from NDI-affected patients. Functional characterization of these mutants revealed that R113Q and C192S were normally localized at the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and presented proper glycosylation maturation. On the other side, L86P, M272R, and W323_I324insR mutants were retained in endoplasmic reticulum and exhibited immature glycosylation and considerably reduced stability. All five mutants were resistant to administration of vasopressin analogues as evaluated by defective response in cAMP release. In order to rescue the function of the mutated V2R, we tested VX-809, sildenafil citrate, ibuprofen and tolvaptan in MDCK cells. Among these, tolvaptan was effective in rescuing the function of M272R mutation, by both allowing proper glycosylation maturation, membrane sorting and response to dDAVP.

Ibuprofen (IBU) loaded PCL fibrous mats (12% PCL-IBU) were sandwiched between fibrous polycaprolactone layers during the process of electrospinning, by varying the polymer concentrations (10% (w/v), 12% (w/v)) and volume of coat (1 ml, 2 ml) in flanking layers. Consequently, 12% PCL-IBU (without sandwich layer) showed burst release of 66.43% on day 1 and cumulative release (%) of 86.08% at the end of 62 days. Whereas, sandwich groups, especially 12% PCLSW-1 & 2 (sandwich layers-1 ml and 2 ml of 12% PCL) showed controlled initial burst and cumulative (%) release compared to 12% PCL-IBU. Moreover, crystallinity (%) and hydrophobicity of the sandwich models imparted control on ibuprofen release from fibrous mats. Further, assay for cytotoxicity and scanning electron microscopic images of cell seeded mats after 5 days showed the mats were not cytotoxic.

The model was developed based on mass and momentum transfer to predict separation and removal of ibuprofen (IP) and its metabolite compound, i.e. 4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP) from aqueous solution. The modeling study was carried out for a membrane contactor considering mass transport of solute from feed to organic solvent (octanol solution). The solute experiences different mass transfer resistances during the removal in membrane system which were all taken into account in the modeling. The model's equations were solved using computational fluid dynamic technique, and the simulations were carried out to understand the effect of process parameters, flow pattern, and membrane properties on the removal of both solutes. The simulation results indicated that IP and 4-IBAP can be effectively removed from aqueous feed by adjusting the process parameters and flow pattern. More removal was obtained when the feed flows in the shell side of membrane system due to improving mass transfer.

However current microneedle technologies may not have the mechanical properties for reliable and stable penetration (e.g. hydrogel microneedles). Moreover, it is also challenging to realize microneedle arrays with large size and high flexibility. There is also an inherent upper limit to the amount and kind of drugs that can be loaded in the microneedles. In this paper, we present a new class of polymeric porous microneedles made from biocompatible and photo-curable resin that address these challenges. The microneedles are unique in their ability to load solid drug formulation in concentrated form. We demonstrate the loading and release of solid formulation of anesthetic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, namely Lidocaine and Ibuprofen. Paper also demonstrates realization of large area (6 × 20 cm<sup>2</sup>) flexible and stretchable microneedle patches capable of drug delivery on any body part. Penetration studies were performed in an ex vivo porcine model supplemented through rigorous compression tests to ensure the robustness and rigidity of the microneedles.

Low toxicity and favorable physical, Lipinski-type, and solubility properties were elucidated by ADME-tox studies. Molecular docking of SAPE against COX-2 revealed favorable MolDockscore, rerank score, interaction energy, internal pose energy, and hydrogen bonding as compared to ibuprofen and indomethacin. An average RMSD of ~ 0.13 nm for the docked complex with stable dynamic equilibrium condition was noted during the 20 ns MD simulation. A low band gap predicting a strong binding affinity at the enzyme's active site was further predicted by DFT analysis. The ester caused a reduction in the percentage of erythrocyte hemolysis and was shown to be non-cytotoxic against human lymphocytes, CaCo-2, and HepG-2 cells by the MTT assay. Moreover, it's in vitro efficacy in inhibiting COX-2 enzyme under both LPS stimulated intestinal cells and direct sequestration assays was found to be higher than salicylic acid and indomethacin. The anticancer activity of SAPE was tested on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and potential efficacy was exhibited in terms of decreased cell viability. Flow cytometry analysis exhibited the arrest of the cell cycle at G1/G0 and S phases, during which induction of autophagic vesicle formation and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed owing to increased ROS production. Furthermore, at these phases, the onset of apoptosis along with DNA damage was also observed. Pre-treatment with SAPE in colitis-induced Wistar rats displayed low disease activity index and reduction in the extent of intestinal tissue disruption and lipid peroxidation. A marked increase of anti-oxidative enzymes viz., catalase, GGT, and GST, and a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in the intestinal tissue extracts of the treated groups was noted.

Such material was tested for cytotoxicity (toward L929 mouse fibroblasts) and anti-inflammatory activity (towards human Hs68 fibroblasts) based on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. The results showed that the drug attachment and its performance are influenced by a combination of mercerization, bleaching and polylactide grafting, and the release of ibuprofen depends on the drug-loaded layer structure.

The free radical inhibition assay demonstrated a 71.0% inhibition under the influence of Zn-MOF. In vitro cytotoxicity activity of Zn-MOF against HepG-2 and Caco-2 cell lines revealed differential cytotoxic effects, with higher cytotoxicity against Caco-2 as explored from the IC<sub>50</sub> values.

Yet, their transferability from bench to bedside is still a challenge as it hits many barriers. Among them, the absence of a clear design made on the deeper understanding of the intermolecular forces underlying the formation of the drug-carrier system and the controlled release of the drug is relevant. In this contribution, we rationally designed and prepared lipid-based formulations of an anticancer drug, fluorouracil (FU - hydrophilic) and an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen (IBU - hydrophobic) to thoroughly characterize the specific intermolecular interactions between drugs and components of the carrier matrix. Microemulsions (ME) were selected as the main carriers for this study, but a comparison with liposomes was performed to observe if different organization of the lipophilic and hydrophilic compartments influences the loading capacity and controlled release of these two drugs. Using Maisine CC, a biocompatible oil, and Tween 20 as the surfactant, normal oil-in-water ME loaded with FU and IBU (1:1, 1:3, 1:6, wt:wt) were prepared by the water titration method. MEs were characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and DOSY spectroscopies to assess their droplet size, surface charge, structure and type of emulsion. Intermolecular interactions between drugs and components of the ME's matrix were investigated by FT-IR, RAMAN and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopies. The experimental results of DOSY revealed that all components of MEs are gathered in normal oil-in-water ME. Due to their different affinities for the main components of the ME, FU, and IBU were mainly distributed in the aqueous and oily phases, respectively, as supported by the droplet size measured by DLS. It was observed that co-loading the two drugs impacted the release behavior, assessed by the dialysis bag method, as compared with the mono-drug formulations. Based on the findings of this work, a release mechanism for FU and IBU was proposed, as well.

This method effectively solves the coupled non-linear system of second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), incorporating the mass transfer associated with the DKR reaction rate. The DKR rate equations are computed utilizing both enantiomers, which represent the enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate within the barrier's support matrix, where the racemization term is negligible. Additionally, the corresponding racemization of the unreacted substrate outside the membrane is considered, where the enzymatic hydrolysis term is negligible. The dimensionless steady-state solution for the dynamics of the mean integrated effectiveness factor (MIEF) related to convective hydrolysis-racemization phenomena quantifies the local effectiveness factor, which impacts the Thiele modulus and the bulk initial concentrations of a substance within the membrane layer. The Bodenstein number is a critical parameter that optimizes reaction conditions, enhances mixing efficiency, and mitigates mass transfer limitations. The normalized values from the sensitivity analysis are analyzed to identify the key parameters of the present system. The conversion efficiency and limitations of the proposed model utilizing HPM are presented. Our proposed solution compares the semi-analytical expression with the simulated numerical results of BVP-4c using the built-in solver in MATLAB R2023b software, demonstrating good agreement across all values of the reaction parameters.

Increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from symptomatic asthmatic patients. IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) are known to stimulate a number of cells to produce inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins. Although airway smooth muscle (ASM) is known to be a rich source of prostaglandins, the regulation of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) isoforms and prostanoid production by proinflammatory cytokines have not been studied in human airway smooth muscle. 2. We studied the effects of IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IFN gamma on the induction of two isoforms of cyclo-oxygenase and its relation to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release and COX activity (reflected by PGE2 synthesis from exogenous arachidonic acid) in human cultured airway smooth muscle cells. 3. IL-1 beta, but not TNF alpha or IFN gamma, caused a time- and concentration-dependent enhancement in PGE2 and other prostanoid (6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and PGD2) production, with PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha as the principal products. This stimulation was accompanied by a corresponding increase in COX activity. 4. COX-2 protein measured by Western blot analysis was not detectable in untreated cells, but was increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by IL-1 beta, but not TNF alpha or IFN gamma. In contrast, no variation in the expression of COX-1 protein was observed. 5. Pretreatment with the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indomethacin and ibuprofen, and the selective COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 and nimesulide, completely blocked IL-1 beta-induced PGE2 release and COX activity. The glucocorticosteroid dexamethasone and protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide and actinomycin D, not only markedly inhibited IL-1 beta-stimulated PGE2 release and COX activity but also suppressed IL-1 beta-induced COX-2 induction. 6. This study demonstrates that human cultured ASM cells release prostanoids in response to IL-1 beta stimulation and that the response is mostly mediated by the induction of COX-2 rather than COX-1 isoenzyme, implying that airway smooth muscle may be an important source of prostaglandins in human airways and that COX-2 may play an important role in the regulation of the inflammatory process in asthma.",1997,,"Pang L, Knox AJ.",https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0701152,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Specific details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Experimental setup for drug permeation/release', 'Data on diffusion cell usage during experiments']","While the abstract mentions ibuprofen as an NSAID that blocks specific cellular responses, it does not indicate that the study focuses on permeation or release properties in an in vitro setting relevant to diffusion cells.",0.5

In order to elucidate the role of endogenous ET in the kidney, we examined the effects of ET receptor antagonists on systemic and renal vasculature in normotensive anaesthetized rats. 2. Intravenous injection of a selective ETA receptor antagonist, FR139317 (0.5 mumol kg-1, for 20 min) induced a very small fall in blood pressure. Similarly, a non-selective ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, TAK-044 (12.5 mumol kg-1, for 20 min) slightly decreased blood pressure. A selective ETB receptor antagonist, BQ-788 (0.5 mumol kg-1, for 20 min) had no effect of blood pressure. 3. FR139317 and TAK-044 did not affect renal blood flow or calculated renal vascular resistance.

MED,9517383,9517383.0,10.1038/sj.bjp.0701652,Modulation of transcription factor NF-kappaB by enantiomers of the nonsteroidal drug ibuprofen.,"1. The nonsteroidal drug ibuprofen exists as an R(-)- and S(+)-enantiomer. Only the S(+)-enantiomer is an effective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, while the R(-)-enantiomer is inactive in this respect. Thus the molecular mechanism by which R(-)-ibuprofen exerts its anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects remains unknown. 2. In this study the effects of the enantiomers of ibuprofen on modulation of transcription factors have been examined with electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA), transient transfection experiments, confocal immunofluorescence and nuclear import experiments, to determine their selectivity and potency as inhibitors of the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). 3. R(-)-ibuprofen (IC50: 121.8 microM) as well as the S(+)-enantiomer (IC50: 61.7 microM) inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB in response to T-cell stimulation. The effect of ibuprofen was specific because, at concentrations up to 10 mM, ibuprofen did not affect the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) and the activation of NF-kappaB by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Very high concentrations of ibuprofen (20 mM) did not prevent NF-kappaB binding to DNA in vitro. Immunofluorescence and nuclear import experiments indicate that the site of ibuprofen action appeared to be upstream of the dissociation of the NF-kappaB-IkappaB-complex. 4.

MED,9806341,9806341.0,10.1038/sj.bjp.0702090,Cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-independent actions of nitric oxide on the renal afferent arteriole.,"1. The effects of exogenous NO and endothelial-derived NO (EDNO) on the afferent arteriole were investigated in the in vitro perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney. Vessels were pre-constricted with angiotensin II (0.1-0.3 nM) or KCl (30 mM). NO was infused directly into the renal artery at concentrations ranging from 30-9000 nM. ODQ (10, 30 microM) was administered to examine the effects of guanylyl cyclase inhibition. Kidneys were treated with ibuprofen (10 microM) to avoid actions of prostaglandins. 2. During angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction, NO elicited vasodilation at concentrations of 30 900 nM (EC50=200 nM) and ODQ caused a 10 fold shift in NO-sensitivity (EC50 1600 nM). During KCl-induced vasoconstriction, NO elicited a maximal dilation of 82+9% at 9000 nM (EC50 2000 nM) and ODQ had no effect. Thus in the presence of ODQ, the NO concentration-response curves for KCI- and angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction were identical (P>0.2). 3. To assess the possible role of cyclic GMP-independent mechanisms in the actions of EDNO, we compared the effects of L-NAME, ODQ and ODQ+L-NAME on acetylcholine-induced vasodilation. Angiotensin II reduced afferent arteriolar diameters from 16.7+/-0.5 to 8.1+/-0.8 microns and acetylcholine fully reversed this effect (16.9+/-0.5 microns). ODQ restored the angiotensin II response in the presence of acetylcholine (7.1+/-0.6 microns) and the subsequent addition of L-NAME had no further effect (6.8+/-0.7 microns). Similarly, L-NAME alone, fully reversed the actions of acetylcholine. 4. Our findings indicate that exogenous NO is capable of eliciting renal afferent arteriolar vasodilation through both cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-independent mechanisms. The cyclic GMP-independent action of NO did not require K+ channel activation, as it could be elicited in the presence of 30 mM KCl. Finally, although cyclic GMP-independent effects of exogenous NO could be demonstrated in our model, EDNO appears to act exclusively through cyclic GMP.",1998,,"Trottier G, Triggle CR, O'Neill SK, Loutzenhiser R.",https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0702090,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,yes,uncertain,"['Study design details', 'Ibuprofen formulation and concentration', 'Detailed methodology of permeation tests']","The study focuses on the actions of nitric oxide in renal arterioles and mentions ibuprofen but does not primarily address in vitro permeation/release, making it less relevant for the dataset.",0.5

Spinal prostanoids are implicated in the development of thermal hyperalgesia after peripheral injury, but the specific prostanoid species that are involved are presently unknown. The current study used an in vitro spinal superfusion model to investigate the effect of substance P (SP), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), and capsaicin on multiple prostanoid release from dorsal spinal cord of naive rats as well as rats that underwent peripheral injury and inflammation (knee joint kaolin/carrageenan). 2. In naive rat spinal cords, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha, but not TxB2, levels were increased after inclusion of SP, NMDA, or capsaicin in the perfusion medium. 3. Basal PGE2 levels from spinal cords of animals that underwent 5-72 h of peripheral inflammation were elevated relative to age-matched naive cohorts. The time course of this increase in basal PGE2 levels coincided with peripheral inflammation, as assessed by knee joint circumference. Basal 6-keto-PGF1alpha levels were not elevated after injury. 4. From this inflammation-evoked increase in basal PGE2 levels, SP and capsaicin significantly increased spinal PGE2 release in a dose-dependent fashion. Capsaicin-evoked increases were blocked dose-dependently by inclusion of S(+) ibuprofen in the capsaicin-containing perfusate. 5.

Similar actions on normal gastric epithelial cells could contribute to NSAID gastropathy. The present work therefore compared the actions of diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and the cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor, NS-398, on a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells. Cell number was assessed by staining with crystal violet. Apoptotic activity was determined by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei and by assay of caspase-3-like activity. Necrosis was evaluated from release of cellular enzymes. Ibuprofen (250 microM for 24 h) promoted cell loss, and apoptosis, under both basal conditions and when apoptosis was increased by 25 microM N-Hexanoyl-D-sphingosine (C(6)-ceramide). Diclofenac (250 microM for 24 h) reduced the proportion of apoptotic nuclei from 5.2 to 2.1%, and caused inhibition of caspase-3-like activity, without causing necrosis under basal conditions. No such reduction in apoptotic activity was evident in the presence of 25 microM C(6)-ceramide. The inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal caspase-3-like activity was also exhibited by the structurally similar mefenamic and flufenamic acids (1 - 250 microM), but not by niflumic acid. Inhibition of superoxide production by the cells increased caspase-3-like activity, but the inhibitory action of diclofenac on caspase activity remained. Diclofenac did not affect superoxide production. Diclofenac inhibited caspase-3-like activity in cell homogenates and also inhibited human recombinant caspase-3. In conclusion, NSAIDs vary in their effect on apoptotic activity in a primary culture of guinea-pig gastric mucous epithelial cells, and the inhibitory effect of diclofenac on basal apoptosis could involve an action on caspase activity.",2002,,"Ashton M, Hanson PJ.",https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0704497,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Specifics on ibuprofen formulation', 'Experimental setup details', 'Data related to measured endpoints']",The study primarily focuses on the apoptosis effects of NSAIDs rather than permeation or release characteristics.

The L-arginine-NO pathway has been implicated in the vasorelaxant effect of 17-beta-oestradiol. Here we have addressed the involvement of two distinct activation steps of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the 17-beta-oestradiol-induced vasorelaxant effect on rat aortic rings. 2. Rat aortic rings contracted with phenylephrine (PE) 1 microM relaxed in a concentration related fashion to 17-beta-oestradiol water soluble cyclodextrin-encapsulated (E2) only when endothelium was present. The pure anti-oestrogen of E2 receptor ICI 182,780 (20 microM) significantly inhibited E2-induced vasorelaxation. 3. Geldanamycin (10 microM), a specific inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, significantly inhibited E2-induced vasorelaxation. 4. Incubation of rat aortic rings up to 6 h with LY 294002 (25 microM), a specific inhibitor of PI(3)K akt/pkb pathway reduced E2-induced vasorelaxation. 5. Incubation of rat isolated aorta with E2, induced prostacyclin (PGI(2)) release. PGI(2) levels, measured as 6-keto PGF(1alpha), were abolished by ibuprofen (10 microM), both L-NAME and GA did not influence basal or E2-stimulated PGI(2) confirming the specificity of these two compounds on eNOS pathway. 6.

However, NSAIDs often cause several serious liver injuries, such as drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and the molecular mechanisms of DILI have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we developed a systems pharmacology approach to explore the mechanism-of-action of NSAIDs. We found that the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) antagonism of NSAIDs is a potential molecular mechanism of DILI through systematic network analysis and in vitro assays. Specially, the quantitative real-time PCR assay reveals that indomethacin and ibuprofen regulate FXR downstream target gene expression in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the western blot shows that FXR antagonism by indomethacin induces the phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), promotes the activation of caspase9, and finally causes DILI.

Thus, a crack-free and uniform MOF membrane with high performance was successfully obtained. In this case, 2-methylimidazole was believed to react with ZnO to form uniform ZIF nuclei, which induced and guided the growth of ZIF-8 membrane. The as-prepared ZIF-8 membrane had large surface area and good thermal stability. As expected, it displayed high adsorption capacity for acidic drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, ketoprofen and acetylsalicylic acid) as they could interact through hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interaction.

To overcome these limitations, we used molecular design to create therapeutic methacrylic (TMA) monomers to impart tunable mechanical properties, decreased formaldehyde release, and covalently-controlled bioactivity to commercial cyanoacrylate adhesives. The small molecule therapeutics ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and benzocaine were covalently tethered to the carbonyl of methacrylate using anhydride, ester, and amide bonds. When these TMAs were incorporated into n-butyl cyanoacrylate (BCA) tissue adhesives, the resulting TMA-BCA materials provided release of the therapeutics across a range of time scales according to the reactivity of the tether bond to hydrolysis. The anhydride-tether TMA-BCA adhesive delivered ibuprofen on the same order of magnitude and time scale as topical medications (12 ± 6 mg per g adhesive after 3.4 h). TMA-BCA adhesives also produced less formaldehyde than standard BCA adhesive, showed promising cytocompatibility, and adhered effectively to porcine skin. Further, the anhydride, ester, and amide tether TMA-BCA adhesives exhibited a range of shear moduli, with those containing rigid aromatic amide groups being stiffer, and those with flexible alkyl segments being less stiff, which could enable these adhesives to be tailored to match the mechanical properties of target tissues.

It has been proposed that the presence of antibiotics at concentrations typically found in wastewater can impact the dynamics of bacterial populations and facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance. The efficiency of currently-used wastewater treatment technologies in eliminating pharmaceuticals is often insufficient, resulting in the release of low concentrations of these compounds into the environment. In this study, we addressed these challenges by evaluating how different influent ibuprofen (IBU) concentrations influenced the efficiency of a laboratory-scale, integrated constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) system seeded with <i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>, in terms of organic matter removal, electricity generation, and change of bacterial community structure compared to unplanted, sediment MFC (S-MFC) and abiotic S-MFC (AS-MFC). We observed that the addition of IBU (5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) resulted in a notable decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and electricity generation, suggesting that high influent IBU concentrations caused partial inhibition for the electroactive microbial community due to its complexity and aromaticity. However, CW-MFC could recover from IBU inhibition after an acclimation period compared to unplanted S-MFC, even though the influent IBU level was increased up to 20 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting that plants in CW-MFCs have a beneficial role in relieving the inhibition of anode respiration due to the presence of high levels of IBU; thus, promoting the metabolic activity of the electroactive microbial community. Similarly, IBU removal efficiency for CW-MFC (<i>i.e.</i>, 49-62%) was much higher compared to SMFC (<i>i.e.</i>, 29-42%), and AS-MFC (<i>i.e.</i>, 20-22%) during all experimental phases. In addition, our high throughput sequencing revealed that the high performance of CW-MFCs compared to S-MFC was associated with increasing the relative abundances of several microbial groups that are closely affiliated with anode respiration and organic matter fermentation.

We designed and synthesized peptides based on this palindromic sequence conjugated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen and ibuprofen to obtain novel hybrid peptides that could trigger inflammatory processes within cancer cells. Incorporating the non-natural amino acid ornithine as a spacer was done to improve the aqueous solubility of the NSAID-peptide conjugates. The antibacterial activity of the conjugated peptides was evaluated, and these peptides showed significant activity against <i>E. coli</i> strain ATCC 25922, with MIC values of 12 μM. Cytotoxicity was assessed in human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and human melanoma cells (A375), showing that the NSAID-conjugated peptides retained and even exhibited better anticancer activity compared to the palindromic peptide from which they were derived.

Three-dimensional scaffolds that can control the release of anti-inflammatory agents over time and space offer a promising approach to regulate the immune response while providing structural support during healing. In this study, we developed an electrospun biomimetic scaffold incorporating ibuprofen-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with an ultrasound-responsive alginate coating. Optimal parameters for safe and non-invasive ultrasound stimulation (<i>i.e.</i>, frequency, intensity, and duration) were identified to induce weakening of the interaction among the alginate chains, enabling on-demand drug release from the nanoparticles. <i>In vitro</i> studies with human macrophages confirmed the biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory efficacy of the nanoparticles at concentrations up to 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>.

As part of our effort to understand the mechanism by which celecoxib mediates apoptosis in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, we investigated its effect on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Digital ratiometric imaging analysis indicates that exposure of PC-3 cells to celecoxib stimulates an immediate [Ca(2+)](i) rise in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Kinetic data show that this Ca(2+) signal arises from internal Ca(2+) release in conjunction with external Ca(2+) influx. Examinations of the biochemical mechanism responsible for this Ca(2+) mobilization indicate that celecoxib blocks endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-ATPases. Consequently, inhibition of this Ca(2+) reuptake mechanism results in Ca(2+) mobilization from ER stores followed by capacitative calcium entry, leading to [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. In view of the important role of Ca(2+) in apoptosis regulation, this Ca(2+) perturbation may represent part of the signalling mechanism that celecoxib uses to trigger rapid apoptotic death in cancer cells. This Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitory activity is highly specific for celecoxib, and is not noted with other COX inhibitors tested, including aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, rofecoxib (Vioxx), DuP697 and NS398. Moreover, it is noteworthy that this activity is also observed in many other cell lines examined, including A7r5 smooth muscle cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells and Jurkat T cells.

The thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist BM 13.177 (20 microM), the phospholipase A2 inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl bromide (20 microM) and the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (50 microM) also decreased the glycogenolytic and vasoconstrictive responses of the perfused rat liver upon adenosine infusion by 50-80%. When the indomethacin inhibition of adenosine-induced prostaglandin D2 release was titrated, a close correlation between prostaglandin D2 release and the metabolic and vascular responses to adenosine was observed. These findings suggest an important role for eicosanoids in mediating the nucleoside responses in the perfused rat liver. Since eicosanoids are known to be formed by non-parenchymal cells in rat liver [Decker (1985) Semin. Liver Dis. 5, 175-190], the present study gives further evidence for an important role of eicosanoids as signal molecules between the different liver cell populations.",1990,,"vom Dahl S, Wettstein M, Gerok W, Häussinger D.",https://doi.org/10.1042/bj2700039,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific permeability measurements', 'Diffusion cell methodology', 'Comparative results with Franz cell', ""Endpoints related to ibuprofen's effects""]",The abstract focuses on adenosine's effects in the liver with mention of ibuprofen's role but does not clearly relate to ibuprofen's permeation using diffusion cells.

Adenosine (20 microM) increased in antegrade perfusions the perfusion pressure and markedly stimulated prostaglandin D2, thromboxane B2 and glucose output, whereas in retrograde perfusions no pressure and eicosanoid response occurred and glucose output was stimulated only slightly. The perfusion-direction-dependent differences in the glucose and pressure response to adenosine (20 microM) were fully abolished in presence of ibuprofen (50 microM). When the adenosine concentration in influent was raised to 200-300 microM, i.e. to a concentration exceeding single-pass clearance of the nucleoside, the adenosine-induced prostaglandin D2 release was about 10-fold higher in retrograde perfusions than in antegrade perfusions. On the other hand, both adenosine (20-300 microM)-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) and K+ release from the liver were not affected by the direction of perfusion, and maximal effects on cAMP release were observed at influent adenosine concentrations of 100 microM. The basal rate (adenosine absent) of prostaglandin D2 and thromboxane B2 release was about 10-fold higher in retrograde than in antegrade perfusion experiments, whereas the basal cAMP release from the liver was not affected by the direction of perfusion. Maximal adenosine-stimulated glucose output was significantly higher in antegrade than in retrograde perfusions at all adenosine concentrations tested (range 10-300 microM). Ibuprofen abolished this difference, indicating that eicosanoids liberated under the influence of adenosine contribute to the glycogenolytic response in antegrade, but not in retrograde, perfusion. Desensitization occurred following repetitive adenosine infusion; this was more pronounced for adenosine-induced prostaglandin release than for cAMP or K+ efflux. The data suggest the following. (i) Both cAMP and eicosanoids are involved in the stimulation of glycogenolysis by adenosine. (ii) Eicosanoids are probably liberated under the influence of extracellular adenosine from a portal pre-sinusoidal compartment and accordingly stimulate glycogenolysis only in antegrade perfusions. Thus signals derived from portal vein structures can modulate hepatocellular function. (iii) Contractile elements are probably located also inside the liver acinus.

Both diseases are associated with inflammation and release of NGF or BDNF from platelets may play a potent role.<h4>Methods</h4>Platelets were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats and were incubated with anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen and indomethacin) and antidepressants (citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline) (final concentration: 0.3 µM) with or without 2 mM calcium chloride. The release of NGF and BDNF was analyzed in comparison to serotonin release from rat platelets after 10 or 60 min.<h4>Results</h4>Spontaneous release of serotonin and BDNF was approximately 10-15% of total serotonin or BDNF content in platelets, but nearly all NGF was released within 10 min. All antidepressants increased the serotonin release from rat platelets. NGF release was reduced by sertraline, paroxetine and ibuprofen, but only when calcium was present, except for sertraline after 10 min. BDNF release was only reduced by ibuprofen when calcium was added.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We conclude that antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs differentially influence the NGF and BDNF release, in a time-, dose- and calcium-specific pattern.",2013,,"Hochstrasser T, Ehrlich D, Sperner-Unterweger B, Humpel C.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1314843,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology for drug formulation', 'Specific measurements of permeation', 'Experimental design related to diffusion cells']",The study focuses on the effects of ibuprofen on the release of neurotrophic factors from platelets rather than on in vitro permeation or release mechanisms relevant to diffusion cells.,0.7

In this study, the combination of attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopic imaging with specifically designed polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices to study drug release from pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. First, the high-throughput analysis of the dissolution of micro-formulations studied under flowing conditions has been introduced using a model formulation of ibuprofen and polyethylene glycol. The behaviour and release of the drug was monitored in situ under different pH conditions. In contrast to the neutral solution, where both the drug and excipient dissolved at a similar rate, structural change from the molecularly dispersed to a crystalline form of ibuprofen was characterised in the obtained spectroscopic images and the corresponding ATR-FTIR spectra for the experiments carried out in the acidic medium. Further investigations into the behaviour of the drug after its release from formulations (i.e., dissolved drug) were also undertaken. Different solutions of sodium ibuprofen dissolved in a neutral medium were studied upon contact with acidic conditions. The phase transition from a dissolved species of sodium ibuprofen to the formation of solid crystalline ibuprofen was revealed in the microfluidic channels. This innovative approach could offer a promising platform for high-throughput analysis of a range of micro-formulations, which are of current interest due to the advent of 3D printed pharmaceutical and microparticulate delivery systems. Furthermore, the ability to study dissolved drug in solution under flowing conditions can be useful for the studies of the diffusion of drugs into tissues or live cells.",2016,,"Ewing AV, Clarke GS, Kazarian SG.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4841796?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,both,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology of the microfluidic device', 'Specifics on ibuprofen formulation used', 'Measurable outcomes of drug release', 'pH conditions tested and their effects']","This study involves ibuprofen and its release characteristics in a microfluidic system, offering valuable insights relevant to permeation studies.",0.9

However, clinical studies have shown that the Cox-2 selective drugs (or coxibs) rofecoxib and etoricoxib, at therapeutic doses, do not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, in contrast to ibuprofen. Here, we have evaluated the relative potential of ibuprofen and various coxibs to interfere with the inactivation of Cox-1 by aspirin by using purified enzyme and calcium ionophore-activated human platelets. The irreversible inactivation of Cox-1 by aspirin can be antagonized by ibuprofen and coxibs, albeit with widely different potencies. The rank order of potencies for this process (ibuprofen > celecoxib > valdecoxib > rofecoxib > etoricoxib) parallels that obtained for the inhibition of Cox-1-mediated thromboxane B(2) production by calcium ionophore-stimulated platelets. The antagonism of aspirin therefore likely involves a competition at the enzyme active site. The EC(50) value for the antagonism against 10 microM aspirin for each drug is approximately 10- to 40-fold lower than the corresponding IC(50) value for inhibition of platelet Cox-1 activity, consistent with the much weaker initial binding of aspirin to Cox-1 as compared with arachidonic acid.

This time-dependent conversion of the adrenergic receptor response from alpha 1 to beta type is prevented by the presence in the incubation medium of 0.5% fatty-acid-free, but not regular, bovine serum albumin. A 20-min exposure of freshly isolated liver cells to arachidonic acid (10 micrograms/ml), but not to stearic or palmitic acid, causes an acute shift in the receptor response from alpha 1 to mixed alpha 1/beta type, similar in direction to that seen after prolonged incubation of the cells. This effect of arachidonic acid is prevented by 0.2 microM ibuprofen but not by the same concentration of nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Ibuprofen (1 microM) or indomethacin (1 microM) also inhibits the time-dependent shift in the receptor response. Actinomycin D inhibits the change in receptor response that is caused by prolonged incubation but not the change that is caused by exogenous arachidonic acid. It is proposed that the time-dependent conversion from alpha 1- to beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated glycogenolysis in isolated rat liver cells is related to a parallel increase in the phospholipase-mediated release of arachidonic acid and the subsequent formation of a key cyclooxygenase metabolite. A protein factor appears to be involved in the regulation of the release of arachidonic acid but not in the action of its metabolite. A possible mechanism by which this metabolite may regulate inverse changes in the coupling of alpha 1- and beta-receptors to postreceptor pathways is discussed.",1986,,"Ishac EJ, Kunos G.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.83.1.53,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Specific details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Measurable endpoints related to permeation', 'Experimental setup and diffusion cell use']","The study focuses on receptor response changes in liver cells and the effects of arachidonic acid and ibuprofen, which are not related to in vitro permeation of ibuprofen via diffusion cells.",0.6

Salicylate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit VSMC proliferation by an unknown mechanism unrelated to anti-inflammatory activity. In search for this mechanism, we have studied the effects of salicylate and other NSAIDs on subcellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and Ca(2+)-dependent cell proliferation in rat aortic A10 cells, a model of neointimal VSMCs. We found that A10 cells displayed both store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) and voltage-operated Ca(2+) entry (VOCE), the former being more important quantitatively than the latter. Inhibition of SOCE by specific Ca(2+) released-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC/Orai) channels antagonists prevented A10 cell proliferation. Salicylate and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac, inhibited SOCE and thereby Ca(2+)-dependent, A10 cell proliferation. SOCE, but not VOCE, induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in A10 cells, and mitochondrial depolarization prevented SOCE, thus suggesting that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake controls SOCE (but not VOCE) in A10 cells. NSAIDs depolarized mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, suggesting that they favor the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of CRAC/Orai channels. NSAIDs also inhibited SOCE in rat basophilic leukemia cells where mitochondrial control of CRAC/Orai is well established. NSAIDs accelerate slow inactivation of CRAC currents in rat basophilic leukemia cells under weak Ca(2+) buffering conditions but not in strong Ca(2+) buffer, thus excluding that NSAIDs inhibit SOCE directly. Taken together, our results indicate that NSAIDs inhibit VSMC proliferation by facilitating the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of CRAC/Orai channels which normally is prevented by mitochondria clearing of entering Ca(2+).",2011,,"Muñoz E, Valero RA, Quintana A, Hoth M, Núñez L, Villalobos C.",http://www.jbc.org/article/S0021925820514361/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Specific details on ibuprofen formulation and concentration used', 'Experimental setup regarding diffusion cells or permeation methods', 'Any measurable endpoints related to the effects of NSAIDs on cell proliferation']",The study focuses on the mechanism of action of NSAIDs on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than their permeation or release characteristics pertinent to diffusion cells.

In contrast to gamma-secretase inhibitors, Abeta42-lowering NSAIDs do not impair S3 cleavage in the NOTCH receptor and release of the NOTCH intracellular domain, a finding with conceptual implications for the development of safer drugs targeting Abeta production through gamma-secretase modulation. Intramembrane cleavage and release of an intracellular signaling domain has recently been demonstrated in a number of additional gamma-secretase substrates. We now show in cell-based assays that intramembrane cleavage of APP and ErbB-4 receptor is not impaired by the Abeta42-lowering NSAIDs, sulindac sulfide and ibuprofen. Generation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) was further not inhibited in a cell-free assay at concentrations far exceeding those effective in reducing Abeta42 production. Closer inspection of AICD signaling showed that stabilization of the AICD peptide by FE65 and AICD-mediated transcription were also retained at Abeta42-lowering concentrations. These results demonstrate that S3-like/intramembrane cleavage is preserved by Abeta42-lowering NSAIDs in at least three substrates of gamma-secretase APP, ErbB-4, and NOTCH and underline the striking specificity by which these drugs target Abeta42 production.",2003,,"Weggen S, Eriksen JL, Sagi SA, Pietrzik CU, Golde TE, Koo EH.",http://www.jbc.org/content/278/33/30748.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,yes,uncertain,"['Formulation of ibuprofen', 'In vitro permeation methods used', 'Data on diffusion cell experiments']","The study focuses on the effects of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, on intracellular signaling and does not directly address in vitro permeation or release characteristics relevant to diffusion cells.",0.6

The aim of the present study was to explore these interactions with the basolateral hepatic MRP4 transporter. The inhibition of the MRP4-driven transport by various drugs which can be concomitantly prescribed was also evaluated. In vitro experiments using vesicles overexpressing MRP4 showed an ATP-dependent transport of MPAG driven by MRP4 (Michaelis-Menten constant of 233.9 ± 32.8 µM). MPA was not effluxed by MRP4. MRP4-mediated transport of MPAG was inhibited (from -43% to -84%) by ibuprofen, cefazolin, cefotaxime and micafungin. An in silico approach based on molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations rationalized the mode of binding of MPAG to MRP4.

The aim of this real-life study was to compare the effect of a foam dressing that releases ibuprofen (Biatain Ibu) with local best practice on the treatment of painful exuding wounds.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 185 patients with painful exuding wounds were randomized to either ibuprofen foam treatment (n = 98) or local best practice (n = 87). The primary endpoint was pain relief over 7 days of treatment, assessed daily using a 5-point verbal rating scale (no relief, slight relief, moderate relief, lots of relief, and complete relief). Secondary endpoints included a total reduction in pain intensity for the whole study period (using an 11-point Numeric Box Scale: 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain) and incidence of adverse events (AEs).<h4>Results</h4>More patients in the ibuprofen foam treatment group reported wound pain relief and lower wound pain intensity values after 7 days (p < 0.0001 for both variables).

Dissolution mechanism showed that the dissolution rate of ibuprofen from the poloxamer gels without menthol was independent of the time, but the drug might be dissolved from the poloxamer gels with menthol by Fickian diffusion.

Cataplasm was prepared by dispersing a model drug (ibuprofen), humectant (glycerol), adhesive (Indopol H100), polymer (Carbopol C934P) with other formulation ingredients in a beaker with an open-blade impeller. The paste was cast on a nonocclusive backing membrane and dried overnight. The diffusion of the model drug was studied across a cellulosic membrane using Franz's diffusion cells. The amounts of three formulation variables, carbopol (X1), glycerol (X2), and indopol (X3) were studied at three levels, and a face-centered cubic design was used to maximize the flux. An optimization procedure for maximum flux and minimum lag time predicted a flux of 97.22 mcg/cm2/hr at X1 (2% w/w), X2 (11.75% w/w), and X3 (6%, w/w).

With the diester pretreatment, drug permeation increased and the lag times decreased. No relationship was observed between the solubilities of the drugs in the diesters and the diester enhancement effects. The enhancement effect decreased with an increase of the drug lipophilicity, but increased with an increase of the lipophilic index of the diester up to about 3.5, after which the enhancement effect decreased or remained constant. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was employed to investigate the biophysical changes in the stratum corneum lipids caused by the diesters. The FTIR results showed that treatment of the skin with diesters did not produce a blue shift in the asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching peak positions. However, all of the above diesters showed a decrease in peak heights and areas for both asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching absorbances in comparison with water treatment. These results suggested that the diesters were more effective for enhancing the penetration of hydrophilic drugs than lipophilic drugs, and the enhancing effect of lipophilic diesters was more effective than that of hydrophilic diesters. The enhancement effects of diesters may be due to their causing lipid extraction in the skin.",2002,,"Takahashi K, Sakano H, Numata N, Kuroda S, Mizuno N.",https://doi.org/10.1081/ddc-120015362,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,no,skin,"['Detailed methodology of permeation studies', 'Quantitative results of ibuprofen permeation', 'Comparison with previous studies on permeation', 'Any formulation details of the diesters used']","The study focuses on the permeation of ibuprofen through rat skin using different diesters, providing both measurable endpoints and relevant comparisons in drug permeation.

Different types of intestine parts of cattle, sheep, and pig were applied as biological flat sheet membranes after different modes of pretreatment. Best results were obtained with special parts of cattle appendix. The concentration of each drug in the aqueous feed phase was in the range of 0.1-10 mg (cm3)(-1), the pH-values adjusted between 8 and 10. Pure water was used as the permeation phase. The influence of experimental parameters such as stirring velocity, temperature, pH-value, salt concentration, and the presence of surfactants as well as humic substances was studied. Under all conditions chosen the combined drugs permeate simultaneously through the natural membranes as the permeation kinetics of the individual compounds are very similar, while humic compounds were retained. Additional treatment of the permeate with liquid or solid phase extraction techniques increases crucially the depletion of the drugs from the feed. The mass transfer of the pharmaceuticals through the liquid membranes was carried out in three-compartment transport cells and supported liquid membrane-chambers. The three-phase liquid bulk membrane systems consisted of an aqueous feed solution, an organic solvent (dihexyl ether, decane, undecane, or decanol) with and without a dissolved sulfonic acid, tertiary amine or Cu(II)-chelate compound as a liquid bulk membrane and an aqueous stripping solutions containing dilute solutiuons of Na2CO3, NaOH, HCl, or HClO4. The transport of the drugs shows some differences, which can be attributed to their acid/base-behavior and partition coefficients log Kow. High extraction yields were obtained for sulfamethoxazol and carbamazepine by using polar organic solvents. Maximum transport efficiencies were obtained for the acidic compounds ibuprofen and diclofenac. They were completely extracted by using dihexyl ether loaded with octane sulfonic acid. A pH-gradient between feed and strip increases the efficiency of the transport. Certain three-phase compositions were successfully utilized in supported liquid membrane systems (SLM) so that high enrichment factors (approximately 75) were achieved for traces of diclofenac and ibuprofen.

In the present study, application of three types of water-soluble additives, namely polyethylene glycols (PEG 400, 3350, and 8000), maltodextrins (Maltrin M150, M100, and M040 in the order of lower to higher average polymer size and molecular weight; dextrose equivalence 16.9, 11.1, and 4.8, respectively), and xylitol, as porosity modifiers in the films of a commercially available aqueous ethylcellulose dispersion (Surelease/E-7-7060 plasticized with glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate) was investigated. The effect of type and level of these additives on drug release characteristics and surface and mechanical properties of the polymeric films was studied. Each additive was incorporated at 20 and 30% levels in the polymeric dispersion based on its solids content. Ibuprofen tablets were coated using the polymeric dispersion with and without additive at 3% w/w coat level in a fluid-bed equipment. The coated tablets were evaluated for their drug release rate, coat reflectivity (gloss), Brinell hardness, and elastic modulus. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis of the films was performed to determine the physico-chemical changes in the applied film-coats.

Using menthol and aqueous isopropanol (IPA) as melting point depressing agents, the two-phase melt systems (TMSs) of Ibu consisting of a homogeneous oily phase and a homogeneous aqueous phase were obtained. In TMS with a high S-Ibu: menthol ratio and a low IPA content, the oily phase primarily consisted of Ibu and menthol, whereas the majority of the aqueous phase was IPA and buffer. Using this method, the S-Ibu concentration in the oily phase reached as high as 70% (w/w). The compositional phase diagram was obtained using a titration method to study the relationship between the melting states of the solid components and system composition. S- and RS-Ibu showed different phase diagrams, and the maximum concentration of S-Ibu measured in the oily phase of TMS was much greater than that of RS-Ibu. The permeation study of a series of TMS and non-TMS systems showed that S-Ibu penetrated through shed snake skin faster than RS-Ibu, and the contents of IPA and menthol significantly affected the permeation rates of ibuprofen across shed snake skin, which may be attributed to the higher lipophilicity, and thus, higher solubility of S-Ibu in the skin than RS-Ibu.

Ketoprofen and ibuprofen were selected to study the effect of eutectic formation on membrane permeation using Franz diffusion cells and snake skin as the model membrane. The presence of aqueous isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was necessary to completely transform the solid drugs into an oily state at ambient temperature. As much as the 99.6% of ibuprofen and the 88.8% of ketoprofen added were found in the oily phase of the two-phase liquid system formed when aqueous IPA was added to the eutectic mixture.

MED,19125588,19125588.0,10.1089/neu.2007.0464,Ibuprofen enhances recovery from spinal cord injury by limiting tissue loss and stimulating axonal growth.,"The GTP-binding protein RhoA regulates microfilament dynamics in many cell types and mediates the inhibition of axonal regeneration by myelin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Unlike most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen suppresses basal RhoA activity (Zhou et al., 2003). A recent report suggested that ibuprofen promotes corticospinal axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (Fu et al., 2007). Here, we confirm that ibuprofen reduces ligand-induced Rho signaling and myelin-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth in vitro. Following 4 weeks of subcutaneous administration of ibuprofen, beginning 3 days after spinal cord contusion, animals recovered walking function to a greater degree, with twice as many rats achieving a hind limb weight-bearing status. We examined the relative role of tissue sparing, axonal sprouting, and axonal regeneration in the action of ibuprofen. Histologically, ibuprofen-treated animals display an increase in spared tissue without an alteration in astrocytic or microglial reaction. Ibuprofen increases axonal sprouting from serotonergic raphespinal axons, and from rostral corticospinal fibers in the injured spinal cord, but does not permit caudal corticospinal regeneration after spinal contusion. Treatment of mice with complete spinal cord transection demonstrates long-distance raphespinal axon regeneration in the presence of ibuprofen. Thus, administration of ibuprofen improves the recovery of rats from a clinically relevant spinal cord trauma by protecting tissue, stimulating axonal sprouting, and allowing a minor degree of raphespinal regeneration.",2009,,"Wang X, Budel S, Baughman K, Gould G, Song KH, Strittmatter SM.",https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2007.0464,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['In vitro methods used', 'Formulation details', 'Measurable endpoints', 'Diffusion cell usage']",The study focuses on the effects of ibuprofen on spinal cord injury recovery rather than its permeation properties.

Investigations of compounds that may ameliorate neuronal cell death have largely used rodent models, which are time consuming, expensive, and cumbersome to perform. Previous studies had demonstrated that steroids, particularly dexamethasone and its analog methylprednisolone sodium succinate, exhibit limited neuroprotective effects against neuronal injury. Significantly, many naturally occurring nonsteroidal plant compounds exhibit structural overlap with steroids. In this report, we present an in vitro cellular screen model to practically examine the efficacy of various phytoestrogens in modulating the ibuprofen-induced expression of p75(NTR) and reduced cell survival of CCFSTTG1 and U87MG cells in a rescue (postinjury) or prevention (preinjury) regimen. We show that the phytoestrogen, biochanin A, and, to a lesser extent, genistein are more effective than dexamethasone at reducing p75(NTR) expression and improving the viability of U87MG and CCFSTTG1 before and after p75(NTR) induction. Furthermore, these studies implicate biochanin A's inactivation of p38-MAPK as a possible contributor to reducing p75(NTR) with associated increased cell survival.

However, the inflammatory response to surgery cannot be prevented. This study was designed to evaluate the ability of ibuprofen-loaded poly(l-lactic acid)-polyethylene glycol (PELA) diblock copolymer fibrous membranes in preventing adhesion formation and reduce inflammation. Electrospun PELA fibrous membranes underwent mechanical testing and were characterized by morphology, surface wettability, drug release, and degradation. Results of an in vitro drug release study showed that a burst release was followed by sustained release from fibrous membranes with high initial ibuprofen content. Fewer L929 mouse fibroblasts adhered to and proliferated on the ibuprofen-loaded PELA fibrous membrane compared with tissue culture plates or PELA fibrous membrane without ibuprofen. In a chicken model of flexor digitorum profundus tendon surgery, the ibuprofen-loaded PELA fibrous membranes prevented tissue adhesion and significantly reduced inflammation.

We compared the microvasculature of etomidate-anesthetized animals to that of animals anesthetized with pentobarbital, since its effects on the microvasculature are known. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with etomidate or pentobarbital. The cremaster muscle was prepared for microscopic viewing, leaving the neural and vascular supply intact. Small arterioles were near their maximal diameters in etomidate-anesthetized rats, whereas the pentobarbital group had a large dilator capacity (maximal diameter-basal diameter/basal diameter). The effect on resting arteriolar diameters of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors was tested. Dilator capacity was not affected by the EDRF inhibitor nitro-L-arginine, but it was significantly increased by mefenamic acid and ibuprofen in etomidate-anesthetized animals. To test whether dilator and constrictor mechanisms were normal, serotonin concentration-response curves were obtained in pentobarbital and etomidate-anesthetized animals with and without mefenamate or ibuprofen present. The dilation of small arterioles to serotonin in the etomidate groups with mefenamate or ibuprofen was not significantly different from that of the pentobarbital groups. Serotonin produced a comparable constriction of large arterioles in both anesthetic groups. The topical application of etomidate to the cremaster muscle did not affect arteriolar diameters.

At the immediate site of injury, vessels lose patency. In the periphery, vasodilation and increased permeability become widespread. A variety of interventions were employed to prevent these vascular sequelae. While systemic treatment, immediately after burn trauma, with hydrocortisone or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound indomethacin, was ineffective in preventing vascular alteration, treatments with other NSAI agents such as ibuprofen and imidazole were effective in preventing microvascular occlusion. In addition, utilizing standard radioimmunoassay techniques, the concentrations of the metabolites of two potent eicosanoids, thromboxane and prostacyclin, were measured from fluid collected in the implanted wound chambers. Following full-thickness burns, the synthesis and release of thromboxane were inhibited by indomethacin, imidazole, and ibuprofen.

Significantly, ibuprofen was effective in preserving the dermal vasculature, even when administration was delayed as long as 6 hours after burn trauma.

Whether such drugs, here denoted as 'concomitant drugs', have anticancer effects or interact at the tumor cell level with the anticancer drugs is not very well known. The cytotoxic effects of nine concomitant drugs and their interactions with five anti-cancer drugs commonly used for the treatment of colorectal cancer were screened over broad ranges of drug concentrations in vitro in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116wt. Seven additional tyrosine kinase inhibitors were included to further evaluate key findings as were primary cultures of tumor cells from patients with colorectal cancer. Cytotoxic effects were evaluated using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) and interaction analysis was based on Bliss independent interaction analysis. Simvastatin and loperamide, included here as an opioid agonists, were found to have cytotoxic effects on their own at reasonably low concentrations whereas betamethasone, enalapril, ibuprofen, metformin, metoclopramide, metoprolol and paracetamol were inactive also at very high concentrations. Drug interactions ranged from antagonistic to synergistic over the concentrations tested with a more homogenous pattern of synergy between simvastatin and protein kinase inhibitors in HCT116wt cells.

We describe the occurrence of silent ACS of the hand in a 2-year old patient with atypical symptoms.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>Our patient experienced massive swelling but minimal pain of the hand after a heavy bistro table with a stone tabletop had fallen on the right hand.<h4>Diagnosis</h4>After monitoring the development of ACS for 1 night, we noted increased firmness of the swelling and impaired perfusion of the skin covering the palm and dorsum of the hand. Notably, the patient held the hand in an intrinsic minus position but did not complain of pain after administration of only a single (weight-matched) dose of ibuprofen. Our suspicion of ACS was confirmed intraoperatively because of the elevated intramuscular pressure (up to 60 mm Hg) in several hand compartments.<h4>Interventions</h4>We performed surgical fasciotomy of all hand compartments, followed by temporary coverage of the wounds with Epigard synthetic skin substitute. The wounds were closed stepwise after 2 and 7 days, and occupational therapy was initiated after 3 weeks.<h4>Outcomes</h4>At the 1-year follow-up, we noted unrestricted wrist and finger functions of the patient. The parents reported that there was no difference in the use of the 2 hands during daily activities.<h4>Lessons</h4>The possible development of ACS should be borne in mind even in the absence of marked pain. Although the 3 A's (i.e., anxiety, agitation, and increased analgesic requirements) in the diagnosis of ACS in children are well established, some patients may experience only minimal pain.

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the occurrence of only single propagators of discomfort. Clinical studies with eye drop solutions have shown that a mixture of diverse comfort agents selected to address multiple propagators of discomfort provide the greatest and longest lasting sensations of comfort for the patient. In this paper, multiple propagators of discomfort are addressed through the simultaneous release of four molecules from a novel contact lens to ensure high level of lens wear comfort.<h4>Methods</h4>Silicone hydrogel contact lenses were engineered via molecular imprinting strategies to simultaneously release up to four template molecules including hydropropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), trehalose, ibuprofen, and prednisolone.<h4>Results</h4>By adjusting the ratio of functional monomer to comfort molecule, a high level of control was demonstrated over the release rate. HPMC, trehalose, ibuprofen, and prednisolone were released at therapeutically relevant concentrations with varying rates from a single lens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate use as daily disposable lenses for single day release or extended-wear lenses with multiple day release.

This systematic review examined the effectiveness of topical interventions in the management chronic wound-related pain guided by PRISMA recommendations of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where pain reduction is the primary outcome. Inclusion criteria were adults (older than 18 years) with chronic venous, arterial, diabetic, or pressure ulcers where pain has been managed through topical administration of pharmacological/nonpharmacological agents. Searches were conducted in Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus.

At 10 mg/ml, ibuprofen showed a rapid cidal activity against exponential growth phase C. albicans, accompanied by rapid and extensive leakage of intracellular K+, permeation to propidium iodide, lysis of spheroplasts and severe membrane ultrastructural alterations. These results indicate that the killing of Candida cells is due to direct damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. At 5 mg/ml, ibuprofen inhibited growth; however, it did not kill the yeasts and did not directly affect the cytoplasmic membrane. Evaluation of yeast metabolic vitality with the fluorescent probe FUN-1 showed that growth inhibition induced by the fungistatic drug concentration was due to metabolic alterations. The combination of ibuprofen with fluconazole resulted in synergic activity with eight of the 12 Candida strains studied, including four of the five fluconazole-resistant strains. The MICs of fluconazole for the fluconazole-resistant strains decreased 2-128-fold when the drug was associated with ibuprofen. When in combination with fluconazole, MICs for ibuprofen decreased by up to 64-fold for all the 12 strains studied.

We summarized self-reported pharmacogenetic medication use, assessed concurrent use, and stratified the findings by age, sex, and ethnicity. <h4>Results</h4> Self-reported medication use was analysed in 1.78 million OFH cohort participants included in the June 2025 data release. The cohort was 57.3% female, ranged in age from 18 to 95 years (mean 53.1 years), and 90.2% self-identified as being of “White” ethnicity. Participants reported use of 18 medication groups that were explicitly mentioned in the baseline questionnaire. Due to the structure of the baseline questionnaire, it was only possible to identify exposure to medication groups rather than mention of specific individual medications. Medications and medication groups with pharmacogenetic guidance included anti-depressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclics), statins, proton pump inhibitors, ibuprofen, opioids, clopidogrel and warfarin. A total of 25.2% (N=449,641) of the cohort reported using at least one of these medication groups, and were older, more likely to be female, and reported having more medical conditions than non-users.

Here, we established complementary in vitro human lung models integrating alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells and airway air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures to evaluate standard-of-care antibiotics, host-directed therapies, and virulence-targeting agents. AMLs recapitulated key morphological, transcriptional, and functional features of primary alveolar macrophages, including a CD16 + immunoregulatory phenotype highly permissive to Mtb infection. In parallel, ALI cultures maintained epithelial barrier integrity and secretory functions, allowing apical Mtb infection, drug penetration analysis, and inflammatory profiling. Benchmarking of standard-of-care antibiotics revealed compartment-specific activity: isoniazid, rifampicin, and moxifloxacin were effective in both systems, while pyrazinamide was active only in AMLs. Anti-inflammatory host-directed therapies such as ibuprofen and doramapimod selectively reduced cytokine production without affecting bacterial load.

PF-06273340 is a small molecule inhibitor of Trks A, B and C that reduces pain in nonclinical models, and the present study aimed to investigate the pharmacodynamics of this first-in-class molecule in humans.<h4>Methods</h4>A randomized, double-blind, single-dose, placebo- and active-controlled five-period crossover study was conducted in healthy human subjects (NCT02260947). Subjects received five treatments: PF-06273340 50 mg, PF-06273340 400 mg, pregabalin 300 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg and placebo.

Here, we investigated the role of three different NSAIDs (naproxen, ibuprofen and oxaprozin) on neutrophil responses to CXCL8 and C5a.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>Human neutrophils were isolated from healthy volunteers by dextran and Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients. Neutrophils were pre-incubated with different concentrations (1-100 µM) of NSAIDs or kinase inhibitors. Neutrophil degranulation into supernatants was tested by elisa and zymography. Neutrophil chemotaxis was determined using Boyden chambers. F-actin polymerization was determined by Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin fluorescent assay. Integrin expression was assessed by flow cytometry. The phosphorylation of intracellular kinases was studied by Western blot.<h4>Key results</h4>Pretreatment with NSAIDs did not affect neutrophil degranulation, but inhibited neutrophil migration and polymerization of F-actin, in response to CXCL8 and C5a. Pretreatment with different NSAIDs prevented C5a-induced integrin (CD11b) up-regulation, while only ibuprofen reduced CXCL8-induced CD11b up-regulation. Pre-incubation with naproxen or oxaprozin, but not ibuprofen, inhibited the PI3K/Akt-dependent chemotactic pathways. Both endogenous (released in cell supernatants) or exogenous (added to cell cultures) PGE2 did not affect C5a- or CXCL8-induced activities. Short-term incubation with NSAIDs did not affect neutrophil PGE2 release.<h4>Conclusion and implications</h4>Treatment with NSAIDs reduced C5a- and CXCL8-induced neutrophil migration and F-actin polymerization via different mechanisms.

In a double blind, cross-over, double-dummy manner the patients were pretreated with placebo, a single dose of 200 micrograms of budesonide (topical corticosteroid) given 2 h prior to rechallenge with allergen or 600 mg ibuprofen (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) given per os t.i.d. to steady state starting 24 h prior to the initial allergen challenge. Treatment with ibuprofen induced a slightly lower composite symptom score (P less than 0.05) at the initial allergen challenge when compared with placebo. No differences were noted in the relevant TAME-esterase activities. The allergen challenge resulted in significantly increased proportions of eosinophils in the brush specimens 24 h after the initial allergen challenge (P less than 0.001) with no differences between the different treatment alternatives. At rechallenge there was a reduction in the symptoms of secretion and nasal blockage in both groups receiving active treatment compared with placebo (P less than 0.05), whereas the number of sneezes was not affected and no differences were noted in TAME-esterase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1990,,"Klementsson H, Lindqvist N, Andersson M, Pipkorn U.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.1990.tb00946.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Specific details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Experimental methodology regarding permeation', 'Data on ibuprofen release rates']","The study involves ibuprofen but does not focus on in vitro permeation or release, leading to a park designation.",0.7

In addition to the clinical history, diagnosis was confirmed by provocation to an alternative NSAID. Two groups were considered: (A) patients with cross-intolerance to NSAIDs and intolerance to paracetamol and (B) patients with cross-intolerance to NSAIDs and good tolerance to paracetamol. Etoricoxib was administered to Group A patients and to a representative sample of Group B patients. In the event of a positive response, serum tryptase levels were determined and skin biopsy was performed in five patients in each group.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen was the most commonly implicated drug, followed by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Urticaria was the most common manifestation, followed by angioedema. Most of the patients developed symptoms within 1 h. Twenty-five percent in Group A (n = 47) and 6% in Group B (n = 50) were intolerant to etoricoxib. Skin biopsy showed mast cell activation with the release of tryptase to the extracellular space but without the increase in serum tryptase levels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Selective COX-2 inhibitors may be unsafe in subjects with urticaria and/or angioedema caused by hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs with cross-intolerance if they are intolerant to paracetamol. A quarter of patients who were intolerant to this drug were also intolerant to etoricoxib. In subjects with hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and intolerance to paracetamol, selective COX-2 inhibitors should be administered as a controlled, incremental dose provocation test to assess tolerance.",2011,,"Doña I, Blanca-López N, Jagemann LR, Torres MJ, Rondón C, Campo P, Gómez AI, Fernández J, Laguna JJ, Rosado A, Blanca M, Canto G.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2011.02684.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Specifics on ibuprofen formulation', 'Details on permeability studies', 'Any mention of Franz diffusion cell methodology']","The study focuses on patient responses to a COX-2 inhibitor rather than the in vitro permeation of ibuprofen.

To obtain direct evidence of abnormal eicosanoid biosynthesis in rats injected with anti-glomerular-basement-membrane antibodies (a-GBM), products derived from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) were measured in 24 h urine collections before and after a-GBM. 2. Administration of a-GBM (9.5 mg) caused albuminuria, decreased creatinine clearance, increased numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and increased excretion of TXB2, 2,3-dinor-TXB2 (products of TXA2) and 6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha (products of PGI2) at 24 h. 3. Interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta; 5 micrograms) alone caused an increase in PGI2 metabolite excretion but had no effect on TXA2 metabolites. It had no effect on creatinine clearance but increased numbers of glomerular neutrophils by approximately 4-5 fold compared to a-GBM. 4. Pretreatment of rats with IL-1 beta before a-GBM synergistically increased albumin excretion but only additively increased eicosanoid excretion. Numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and creatinine clearance were unchanged compared to IL-1 beta alone. 5. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (10 mgkg-1 i.p., twice daily for 4 days) inhibited both serum TXB2 production and urinary prostaglandin excretion. It also caused an almost complete attenuation of albumin excretion. Creatinine clearance and glomerular neutrophils remained unchanged after a-GBM/IL-1 beta. 6. We conclude that the 50% inhibition of thromboxane production induced by ibuprofen does not modify the fall in creatinine clearance of accumulation of neutrophils in the glomerulus caused by the a-GBM.

The effect of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), concanavalin A (Con A) and lentil lectin agglutinin (LCA) were investigated on pre-contracted canine coronary artery rings in vitro. 2. In endothelium-intact canine coronary artery, contracted with the thromboxane A2-analogue, U46619, WGA relaxed the tissue in a concentration-dependent manner, with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 112 +/- 17 nM (n = 6).

In the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig taenia caeci, bradykinin produces a relaxation followed by a contraction. In the presence of hexamethonium and guanethidine, both these phases of the response were insensitive to tetrodotoxin (100 nM), omega-conotoxin GVIA (100 nM) and ibuprofen (1 microM), suggesting that they are due to a direct action on the smooth muscle. 2. The B1 receptor-selective agonist, [des-Arg9]-BK (1-100 microM), was inactive in the taenia caeci, and the B1 receptor-selective antagonist, [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK (1-10 microM), did not inhibit either phase of the bradykinin-induced response. The B2 receptor-selective antagonist, D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK (Hoe 140) (30-300 nM), inhibited both the bradykinin-induced relaxation and contraction with a similar affinity (apparent pKB estimates of 8.5 +/- 0.1 and 8.4 +/- 0.1 respectively). 3. In a depolarizing high-K(+)-solution, bradykinin produced concentration-related contractions, though of diminished magnitude; but no relaxation was observed in such media. In Krebs solution, the Ca(2+)-activated K(+)-channel blocker, apamin (10 nM), abolished relaxant responses. These observations suggest that contraction results both from membrane potential-dependent, and membrane potential-independent, mechanisms; whereas relaxant responses result entirely from membrane potential-dependent mechanisms. Contractile responses obtained in the high K(+)-solution were inhibited by D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK with an apparent pKB value of 8.4 +/- 0.1. 4. In a Ca(2+)-free, EGTA-containing medium, relatively high concentrations of bradykinin (> 100 nM) produced transient contractions, suggesting that a component of the contractile response results from release of Ca2+ from an intracellular store. This intracellular Ca2+ store could be refilled in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The B, receptor antagonist, [Leu8,des-Argj-BK (10 micro M), did not inhibit this bradykinin-induced contraction, whereas the B2 receptor antagonist, D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK(100 nM) markedly attenuated it (P<0.001; n = 6).5. Bradykinin (10 nM- 100 micro M) significantly elevated tissue levels of total [3H]-inositol phosphates in the presence of Li?, after incubation with myo-[3H]-inositol. The B, receptor-selective agonist, [des-Argl-BK(100IM) did not stimulate [3H]-inositol phosphate formation, and the B, receptor-selective antagonist,[Leu8,des-Argl-BK, did not inhibit the formation of [3H]-inositol phosphates in response to a submaximal concentration of bradykinin (1I0 1M; P> 0.05). Two B2 receptor antagonists, D-Arg-[Hyp3,DPhe7]-BK and D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-BK, inhibited bradykinin-induced accumulation of total[3H]-inositol phosphates with apparent pKB estimates of 5.4 +/0 0.3 and 8.4 +/- 0.1, respectively.6. These data suggest that in the guinea-pig taenia caeci, the five aspects of the action of bradykinin studied (the relaxant and the contractile elements of the biphasic mechanical response, the contractile response in a depolarizing high-K' solution medium and zero-Ca2+ media, and stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover), all result from activation of B2 receptors. A possible causal relationship is suggested between these B2 receptor-mediated membrane potential-dependent, and -independent events,and their roles in excitation contraction coupling.",1994,,"Field JL, Butt SK, Morton IK, Hall JM.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1510129?pdf=render,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Specific details on experimental setup', ""Any mention of ibuprofen's effects on permeation/release"", 'Formulation details if present', 'Measurable endpoints related to permeation', 'Discussion on relevance to in vitro studies']",The study focuses on smooth muscle responses to bradykinin and does not pertain directly to ibuprofen permeation/release in diffusion cells.,0.7

The mechanisms underlying bradykinin (BK)-mediated contractions in strips of guinea-pig gallbladder (GPG) were examined by use of selective bradykinin (BK) receptor agonists and antagonists. 2. Addition of BK and related kinins (0.1 pM-10 microM) after 2 h of equilibration of the preparation caused graded contractions characterized by two distinct phases: high affinity (0.1 pM-1 nM) and low affinity (3 nM-10 microM). The rank order of potency for the first phase (mean EC50, pM) was: BK (1.36) = Hyp3-BK (1.44) = Lys-BK (1.54) > Tyr8-BK (2.72) > Met-Lys-BK (4.30). The rank order of potency for the second phase (mean EC50, nM, at concentration producing 50% of the contraction caused by 80 mM KCl) was: Hyp3-BK (8.95) > Met-Lys-BK (12.78) > Tyr8-BK (33.75) > Lys-BK caused by 80 mM KCl) was: Hyp3-BK (8.95) > Met-Lys-BK (12.78) > Tyr8-BK (33.75) > Lys-BK (60.92) > BK (77.35). The contractile responses (g of tension) to 3 microM of BK (the highest concentration tested) were: Hyp3-BK, 1.76 +/- 0.09; BK, 1.65 +/- 0.12; Lys-BK, 1.45 +/- 0.13; Tyr8-BK, 1.36 +/- 0.15 and Met-Lys-BK, 1.36 +/- 0.15. The selective B1 agonist, des-Arg9-BK, caused only a weak contraction with maximal response (0.21 +/- 0.05 g), which corresponded to approximately 10% of that induced by BK. 3. BK-induced contraction in GPG was inhibited by indomethacin (3 microM) or ibuprofen (30 microM), and was partially reduced by phenidone (30 microM), but was not affected by atropine (1 JM), nicardipine (1 gM),Ca2+-free medium plus EGTA, dazoxiben (30 nM), L-655,240 (10 nM, a selective receptor antagonist ofthromboxane A2), MK-571 (0.1 microM, a selective leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist), tetrodotoxin(0.3microM), CP 96,345 (0.3 microM, a NK1 receptor antagonist), mepyramine (1 microM), glibenclamide (1 microM), H-7(3 microM), staurosporine (100 nM), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 microM). However, BK-induced contractions in GPG maintained in Ca2+-free medium were markedly attenuated by ryanodine (10microM).4. Prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2alpha or U46619 (0.1 nM to 100microM), caused concentration-dependent contractions in GPG with mean EC50s of 3.1 microM; 1.7 microM and 0.47 nM and maximal responses of1.36 +/-0.15; 1.32 +/- 0.20 and 0.96 +/- 0.09 g, respectively.5. The selective B2 receptor antagonists, Hoe 140, NPC 17731 and NPC 17761 (0.01 -1 microM), caused concentration-dependent displacements to the right of the contractile concentration-response curve for BK. The selective B1 receptor antagonist, des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (1 microM), did not affect BK-induced GPG contraction.6. These data suggest that both high and low affinity BK responses in GPG are mediated by activation of B2 receptors, and that BK-mediated contraction in GPG depends on the release of intracellular Ca2+sources sensitive to ryanodine. In addition, BK-induced contraction in GPG is mediated by release of proinflammatory eicosanoid(s) derived from the cyclo-oxygenase pathway from arachidonic acid metabolism unrelated to thromboxane A2, and seems not to be coupled to activation of a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism.",1995,,"Cabrini DA, Silva AM, Calixto JB.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1995.tb14938.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Endpoints measured related to ibuprofen', 'Formulation information for ibuprofen', 'Use of diffusion cells in the study']","The study focuses on bradykinin-induced contractions and mentions ibuprofen in context, but does not relate to ibuprofen permeation or release.

Our objective was to determine whether endotoxin (ETX) could directly trigger the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from perivascular sensory nerves in the isolated mesenteric arterial bed (MAB) of the rat and to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PGs) are involved. 2. ETX caused time- and concentration-dependent release of CGRP, and as much as a 17 fold increase in CGRP levels in the perfusate at 10-15 min after the administration of ETX (50 micrograms ml-1). 3. CGRP-like immunoreactivity in the perfusate was shown to co-elute with synthetic rat CGRP by reverse-phase h.p.l.c. 4. Pretreatment of MAB with capsaicin or ruthenium red inhibited ETX-induced CGRP release by 90% and 71%, respectively. ETX-evoked CGRP release was decreased by 84% during Ca2(+)-free perfusion. 5. The release of CGRP evoked by ETX was enhanced by L-arginine by 43% and inhibited by N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) and methylene blue by 37% and 38%, respectively. L-Arginine reversed the effect of L-NOARG. 6. Indomethacin and ibuprofen also inhibited the ETX-induced CGRP release by 34% and 44%, respectively. No additive inhibition could be found when L-NOARG and indomethacin were concomitantly incubated. 7. The data suggest that ETX triggers the release of CGRP from capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves innervating blood vessels. The ETX-induced CGRP release is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ influx and involves a ruthenium red-sensitive mechanism.

Ibuprofen was described as being able to revert resistance related to efflux activity in Candida. The aim of this study was to uncover the molecular base of antifungal resistance in C. albicans clinical strains that could be reverted by ibuprofen. Sixty-two clinical isolates and five control strains of C. albicans were studied: the azole susceptibility phenotype was determined according to the Clinical Laboratory for Standards Institute, M27-A2 protocol and minimal inhibitory concentration values were recalculated with ibuprofen (100 microg mL(-1)); synergistic studies between fluconazole and FK506, a Cdr1p inhibitor, were performed using an agar disk diffusion assay and were compared with ibuprofen results. Gene expression was quantified by real-time PCR, with and without ibuprofen, regarding CDR1, CDR2, MDR1, encoding for efflux pumps, and ERG11, encoding for azole target protein. A correlation between susceptibility phenotype and resistance gene expression profiles was determined. Ibuprofen and FK506 showed a clear synergistic effect when combined with fluconazole. Resistant isolates reverting to susceptible after incubation with ibuprofen showed CDR1 and CDR2 overexpression especially of the latter.

Twelve patients were randomised to ibuprofen-foam and 12 patients to local best practice. The study population consisted of patients with chronic, painful exudating leg ulcers. The patients rated their wound pain intensity at baseline and after the first dressing application. Pain intensity in the morning and evening was rated during a period of 1 week using a numeric box scale (NBS). A t-test compared the main differences in pain intensity and a five-point verbal rating scale measured the patients' pain relief. At the last clinical visit, pain after dressing change was assessed using an NBS. In addition, wound size, percentage of healthy granulation tissue and the presence of peri-ulcer erythema, were (all) evaluated at inclusion and the end of the study. The nurses and patients both evaluated the relative dressing performance and exudate management at the last study visit. This study demonstrates that the ibuprofen-foam dressing decreased wound pain in patients with leg ulcers compared to best practice.

A multinational and multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical investigation of 122 patients compared two moist wound-healing dressings, a non adhesive foam dressing with ibuprofen (62 patients randomised to Biatain-Ibu non adhesive, Coloplast A/S) with a non adhesive foam without ibuprofen (60 to Biatain non adhesive). The ibuprofen-foam was regarded successful, if the pain relief on a 5-point verbal rating scale was higher than the comparator without compromising safety, including appropriate healing rate. Additional endpoints were change in persistent wound pain between dressing changes and pain at dressing change on days 1-5 and days 43-47. The primary response variable, persistent pain relief, was significantly higher in the ibuprofen-foam group compared with the comparator on days 1-5, with a quick onset of action (P < 0.05). The patients in the ibuprofen-foam group had a significant (P < 0.05) higher reduction in the persistent wound pain from baseline (40%) as the comparator (30%). Women reported less pain intensity than men, and pain intensity decreased with increasing age. In addition, pain intensity increased with increasing initial pain intensity and increasing wound size. Wound healing was similar in the ibuprofen-foam group to that of the comparator group. No difference in adverse events between placebo and local sustained release of low-dose ibuprofen was observed in this study.

Increased dosage did not produce a proportional increase in the permeation and maximizing the skin-drug contact did not increase penetration: both factors indicate that absorption from deposited drug films was dissolution rate-limited. Occlusion of the skin did not increase the dissolution rate of the deposited drug film, but did elevate the penetration of drug already present within the skin at the time of occlusion. The diffusion coefficients for both drugs were calculated by two methods, yielding 1.8 +/- 1.3 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 and 1.0 +/- 0.56 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 for ibuprofen and 1.9 +/- 0.59 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 and 0.77 +/- 0.23 X 10(-11) cm2 s-1 for flurbiprofen. Increasing the acetone-skin contact time from 2 min to 2 h did not significantly alter the permeability of the skin. Absorption of flurbiprofen was similar from 10 and 100% saturated aqueous solutions, suggesting that the skin has a limited capacity for flurbiprofen transport beyond which further increase in drug penetration may be difficult.

The molecular packing of these various systems was also investigated in Langmuir monolayer studies.<h4>Key findings</h4>Loading and release of drugs within the liposome bilayer was shown to be influenced by their cholesterol content: increasing cholesterol content was shown to reduce drug incorporation and inclusion of cholesterol in the bilayer changed the release profile of propofol from zero-order, for phosphatidyl choline only liposomes, to a first-order model when 11 to 33 total molar % of cholesterol was present in the formulation. At higher bilayer concentrations substitution of cholesterol with tetradecanol was shown to have less of a detrimental impact on bilayer drug loading. However, the presence of cholesterol within the liposome bilayer was shown to reduce drug release compared with fatty alcohols. Monolayer studies undertaken showed that effective mean area per molecule for a 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC):cholesterol mixture deviated by 9% from the predicted area compared with 5% with a similar DSPC:tetradecanol mixture. This evidence, combined with cholesterol being a much more bulky structure, indicated that the condensing influence of tetradecanol was less compared with cholesterol, thus supporting the reduced impact of tetradecanol on drug loading and drug retention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Liposomes can be effectively formulated using fatty alcohols as an alternative bilayer stabiliser to cholesterol.

However, the exercise-induced release of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) may also contribute to the rise in T<sub>C</sub> by increasing the hypothalamic temperature set point. This study investigated whether the exercise-induced increase in T<sub>C</sub> is partly caused by an altered hypothalamic temperature set point.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifteen healthy, active men age 36 ± 14 y were recruited. Subjects performed submaximal treadmill exercise in 3 randomized test conditions: (1) 400 mg ibuprofen and 1000 mg acetaminophen (IBU/APAP), (2) 1000 mg acetaminophen (APAP), and (3) a control condition (CTRL). Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were used to block the effect of IL-6 at a central and peripheral level, respectively. T<sub>C</sub>, skin temperature, and heart rate were measured continuously during the submaximal exercise tests.<h4>Results</h4>Baseline values of T<sub>C</sub>, skin temperature, and heart rate did not differ across conditions. Serum IL-6 concentrations increased in all 3 conditions. A significantly lower peak T<sub>C</sub> was observed in IBU/APAP (38.8°C ± 0.4°C) vs CTRL (39.2°C ± 0.5°C, P = .02) but not in APAP (38.9°C ± 0.4°C) vs CTRL. Similarly, a lower ΔT<sub>C</sub> was observed in IBU/APAP (1.7°C ± 0.3°C) vs CTRL (2.0°C ± 0.5°C, P < .02) but not in APAP (1.7°C ± 0.5°C) vs CTRL. No differences were observed in skin temperature and heart-rate responses across conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combined administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen resulted in an attenuated increase in T<sub>C</sub> during exercise compared with a CTRL.

Sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1; SLC5A8) is expressed in kidney, thyroid gland, neurons, and intestinal tract and exhibits substrate specificity similar to that of the proton-dependent MCT (SLC16A) family. The role of SMCT1 in GHB disposition has not been determined. In this study we characterized the driving force, transport kinetics, and inhibitors of GHB uptake, as well as expression of SMCT and MCT isoforms, in rat thyroid follicular (FRTL-5) cells. GHB, as well as the monocarboxylates butyrate and d-lactate, exhibited sodium-dependent uptake at pH 7.4, which could be described with a simple Michaelis-Menten equation plus a diffusional component [K(m) 0.68 +/- 0.30 mM, V(max) 3.50 +/- 1.58 nmol . mg(-1) . min(-1), and diffusional clearance (P) 0.25 +/- 0.08 microl . mg(-1) . min(-1)]. In the absence of sodium, GHB uptake was significantly increased at lower pH, suggesting proton-gradient dependent transport. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western analyses demonstrated the expression of SMCT1, MCT1, and MCT2 in FRTL-5 cells, supporting the activity results. Sodium-dependent GHB uptake in FRTL-5 cells was inhibited by MCT substrates (d-lactate, l-lactate, pyruvate, and butyrate), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen), and probenecid. IC(50) values for l-lactate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and probenecid were 101, 31.6, 64.4, and 380 muM, respectively. All four inhibitors also significantly inhibited GHB uptake in rat MCT1 gene-transfected MDA/MB231 cells, suggesting they are not specific for SMCT1.

Because PARs are found in the spinal cord and increased prostaglandin release in the spinal cord causes thermal hyperalgesia, we hypothesized that activation of these spinal PARs would stimulate prostaglandin production and cause a cyclooxygenase-dependent thermal hyperalgesia. PARs were activated using either thrombin or peptide agonists derived from the four PAR subtypes, delivered to the lumbar spinal cord. Dialysis experiments were conducted in conscious, unrestrained rats using loop microdialysis probes placed in the lumbar intrathecal space. Intrathecal thrombin stimulated release of prostaglandin E (PGE)(2) but not aspartate or glutamate. Intrathecal delivery of the PAR 1-derived peptide SFLLRN-NH(2) and the PAR 2-derived peptide SLIGRL both stimulated PGE(2) release; PAR 3-derived TFRGAP and PAR 4-derived GYPGQV were inactive. Intrathecal thrombin had no effect upon formalin-induced flinching or tactile sensitivity but resulted in a thermal hyperalgesia. Intrathecal SFLLRN-NH(2) and SLIGRL both produced thermal hyperalgesia. Consistent with their effects on spinal PGE(2), hyperalgesia from these peptides was blocked by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen. SLIGRL-induced hyperalgesia was also blocked by the selective inhibitors SC 58,560 [5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole; cyclooxygenase (COX) 1] and SC 58,125 [5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole; COX 2].

Compared with controls, in SW480 colon and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, phospho-sulindac, phospho-aspirin, phospho-flurbiprofen, and phospho-ibuprofen (P-I) increased the levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and decreased GSH levels and thioredoxin reductase activity, whereas the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (CCDs), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan, oxaliplatin, chlorambucil, paclitaxel, and vincristine, did not. In both cell lines, phospho-NSAIDs induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation much more potently than CCDs. We then treated nude mice bearing SW480 xenografts with P-I or 5-FU that had an opposite effect on RONS in vitro. Compared with controls, P-I markedly suppressed xenograft growth, induced apoptosis in the xenografts (8.9 ± 2.7 versus 19.5 ± 3.0), inhibited cell proliferation (52.6 ± 5.58 versus 25.8 ± 7.71), and increased urinary F2-isoprostane levels (10.7 ± 3.3 versus 17.9 ± 2.2 ng/mg creatinine, a marker of oxidative stress); all differences were statistically significant. 5-FU's effects on tumor growth, apoptosis, proliferation, and F2-isoprostane were not statistically significant. F2-isoprostane levels correlated with the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth. P-I induced oxidative stress only in the tumors, and its apoptotic effect was restricted to xenografts.

Thus, there is a constant need to find new drugs to better manage fungal infections. Toward this end, the study described in this paper considered the repurposing of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and ibuprofen as alternative drugs to control the growth of cryptococcal cells. In vitro susceptibility tests, including a checkerboard assay, were performed to assess the response of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii to the above-mentioned anti-inflammatory drugs. Next, the capacity of these two drugs to induce stress as well as their mode of action in the killing of cryptococcal cells was determined. The studied fungal strains revealed a response to both aspirin and ibuprofen that was dose dependent, with ibuprofen exerting greater antimicrobial action. More importantly, the MICs of these drugs did not negatively (i) affect growth or (ii) impair the functioning of macrophages; rather, they enhanced the ability of these immune cells to phagocytose cryptococcal cells. Ibuprofen was also shown to act in synergy with fluconazole and amphotericin B. The treatment of cryptococcal cells with aspirin or ibuprofen led to stress induction via activation of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, and cell death was eventually achieved through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated membrane damage.

As for diverse gram-negative bacteria, this pathogenic bacterium accumulates diffusible N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules, and when a threshold concentration is reached, virulence factor genes are activated. Human submucosal tracheal gland serous (HTGS) cells are believed to play a major role in the physiopathology of CF. Since ATP and UTP stimulate CF epithelial cells through P2Y receptors, we sought to determine whether CF HTGS cells are capable of responding to the AHLs N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL), N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (HHL), N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), and N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL), with special reference to P2Y receptors.

Our aim was to explore the association between ns-NSAID-related AGI and arterial dysfunction.<h4>Methods</h4>The extent (augmentation index, AIX%) and timing (reflected wave transit time, RWT, ms) of aortic wave reflection (measured using radial applanation pulse wave analysis, PWA, SphygmoCor device) were assessed on a single occasion in 114 consecutive RA patients without overt CV disease aged 40-65 years. A higher AIX% and lower RWT indicate arterial dysfunction. Assessment included a fasting blood sample, patient questionnaire and medical record review. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for age, sex, mean blood pressure, smoking, cumulative erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR-years) and Stanford disability score.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 60 patients taking ns-NSAIDs and 25 non-users. Using a ns-NSAID with the highest AGI was associated with a higher AIX% (and lower RWT) versus treatment with a ns-NSAID with the lowest AGI (diclofenac AIX% 32.3, RWT 132.7 ms vs ibuprofen AIX% 23.8, RWT 150.9 ms): adjusted mean differences AIX% 6.5 (95% CI 1.0 to 11.9; p=0.02); RWT -14.2 ms (95% CI -22.2 to -6.3; p=0.001). Indomethacin demonstrated an intermediate level of arterial dysfunction. In relation to arterial dysfunction, both indomethacin and naproxen were more similar to diclofenac than to ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ns-NSAID-related AGI is associated with arterial dysfunction in patients with RA. These findings provide a potentially novel insight into the CV toxicity of commonly used ns-NSAIDs. However, the findings are limited by the small number of patients involved and require further replication in a much larger study.",2011,,"Crilly MA, Mangoni AA.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000076,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Formulation information about ibuprofen', 'Detailed methods for measuring AGI', 'Results related to ibuprofen specifically']","The study mainly focuses on the cardiovascular effects of NSAIDs in RA patients rather than in vitro permeation or release processes.

Certain HIV-exposed seronegative populations, who are naturally resistant to HIV infection, have an immune quiescent phenotype defined by reduced immune activation and inflammatory cytokines at the genital tract. Therefore, the aim of this study was to create an immune quiescent environment using immunomodulatory drugs to mitigate HIV infection. Using an <i>in vitro</i> peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) model, we found that inflammation was induced using phytohemagglutinin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR4) and R848 (TLR7/8). After treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen (IBF) and betamethasone (BMS), PBMCs were exposed to HIV NL4-3 AD8. Multiplexed ELISA was used to measure 28 cytokines to assess inflammation. Flow cytometry was used to measure immune activation (CD38, HLA-DR and CCR5) and HIV infection (p24 production) of CD4+ T cells. BMS potently suppressed inflammation (soluble cytokines, p<0.05) and immune activation (CD4+ T cells, p<0.05). BMS significantly reduced HIV infection of CD4+ T cells only in the LPS (0.98%) and unstimulated (1.7%) conditions (p<0.02). In contrast, IBF had minimal anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive but no anti-HIV effects. BMS demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects, regardless of stimulation condition. Despite uniform immunosuppression, BMS differentially affected HIV infection according to the stimulation conditions, highlighting the complex nature of these interactions. Together, these data underscore the importance of interrogating inflammatory signaling pathways to identify novel drug targets to mitigate HIV infection.",2021,,"Cromarty R, Sigal A, Liebenberg LJ, Mckinnon LR, Abdool Karim SS, Passmore JS, Archary D.",https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-001424,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specifics about the diffusion cell method', 'Data on permeation or release rates']","The study focuses on immunosuppression and HIV infection in an in vitro PBMC model, rather than on ibuprofen permeation or release using diffusion cells.

Ischemic conditions caused partial depolarization and decrease of excitability. Neither inhibition of PG synthesis (ibuprofen, 30 micrograms/mL) nor addition of exogenous PGF2 alpha (1 ng/mL) modified responses to ""ischemia."" Reperfusion with normal Tyrode's solution stimulated PG production (measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and induced a series of electrophysiological events. Under control conditions, Purkinje fibres rapidly repolarized. Subsequently, these tissues began to depolarize and oscillatory afterpotentials appeared. Purkinje tissues depolarized further and became temporarily inexcitable. Return of activity was associated with depolarization-induced automaticity. Ibuprofen prevented reperfusion-stimulated PG release. Ibuprofen also increased the magnitude of early repolarization and greatly attenuated subsequent depolarization. Depolarization-induced automaticity was not observed under these conditions; however, oscillatory afterpotentials were not abolished by ibuprofen. Addition of PGF2 alpha to ""ischemic"" and reperfusion solutions in the presence of ibuprofen restored the arrhythmogenic responses.

Xenopus laevis kidney A6 cells were used to investigate the effects of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity on Na+ transport. Application of aristolochic acid, a cPLA2 inhibitor, to the apical membrane of monolayers produced a decrease in apical [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) release and led to an approximate twofold increase in transepithelial Na+ current. Increased current was abolished by the nonmetabolized AA analog 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), suggesting that AA, rather than one of its metabolic products, affected current. In single channel studies, ETYA produced a decrease in ENaC open probability. This suggests that cPLA2 is tonically active in A6 cells and that the end effect of liberated AA at the apical membrane is to reduce Na+ transport via actions on ENaC. In contrast, aristolochic acid applied basolaterally inhibited current, and the effect was not reversed by ETYA. Basolateral application of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen also inhibited current. Both effects were reversed by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This suggests that cPLA2 activity and free AA, which is metabolized to PGE2, are necessary to support transport. This study supports the fine-tuning of Na+ transport and reabsorption through the regulation of free AA and AA metabolism.",2001,,"Worrell RT, Bao HF, Denson DD, Eaton DC.",http://intl-ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/281/1/C147,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific methods of diffusion cell use', 'Relevance of Na+ transport to ibuprofen permeation']","The study primarily focuses on Na+ transport mediated by cPLA2 and the effects of ibuprofen, but it does not specifically address ibuprofen's permeation or formulation in a diffusion context.

Acetate, the most abundant SCFA in the foregut lumen, is absorbed immediately after ingestion, although the mechanism by which this absorption occurs is not fully understood. We investigated the distribution and function of candidate SCFA transporters in rat duodenum. The Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter-1 (SMCT1) was localized to the brush border, whereas the pH-dependent monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and MCT4 were localized to the duodenocyte basolateral membrane. In Ussing chambered duodenal mucosa, luminal acetate dose-dependently increased short-circuit current (Isc) in the presence of serosal bumetanide and indomethacin by a luminal Na(+)-dependent, ouabain-sensitive mechanism. The Isc response was inhibited dose-dependently by the SMCT1 nonsubstrate inhibitor ibuprofen, consistent with net electrogenic absorption of acetate via SMCT1. Other SCFAs and lactate also increased Isc. Furthermore, duodenal loop perfusion of acetate increased portal venous acetate concentration, inhibited by coperfusion of ibuprofen or a MCT inhibitor. Luminal acetate perfusion increased duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion via capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerve activation and cyclooxygenase activity, consistent with absorption-mediated HCO3 (-) secretion. These results suggest that absorption of luminal SCFA via SMCT1 and MCTs increases duodenal HCO3 (-) secretion. In addition to SCFA sensing via free fatty acid receptors, the presence of rapid duodenal SCFA absorption may be important for the suppression of luminal bacterial colonization and implicated in the generation of functional dyspepsia due to bacterial overgrowth.",2015,,"Kaji I, Iwanaga T, Watanabe M, Guth PH, Engel E, Kaunitz JD, Akiba Y.",https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.00298.2014,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on experimental setup', 'Formulation of ibuprofen used', 'Any connections to diffusion studies']","The abstract discusses SCFA transport mechanisms and the role of ibuprofen as an inhibitor, but it does not focus on diffusion or permeation studies relevant to Franz cells.",0.7

It is well established that chronic inflammatory pain induces the expression of acid-sensitive ion channels (ASIC) in primary sensory neurons, where they contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia. The present study examines the effect of CH on ASIC expression in petrosal ganglion (PG), which contains chemoafferent neurons that innervate oxygen-sensitive type I cells in the carotid body. Five isoforms of ASIC transcript were increased ∼1.5-2.5-fold in PG following exposure of rats to 1, 3, or 7 days of hypobaric hypoxia (380 Torr). ASIC transcript was not increased in the sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG). In the PG, CH also increased the expression of channel-interacting PDZ domain protein, a scaffolding protein known to enhance the surface expression and the low pH-induced current density mediated by ASIC3. Western immunoblot analysis showed that CH elevated ASIC3 protein in PG, but not in SCG or the (sensory) nodose ganglion. ASIC3 transcript was likewise elevated in PG neurons cultured in the presence of inflammatory cytokines. Increased ASIC expression was blocked in CH rats concurrently treated with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (4 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)). Electrophysiological recording of carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity in vitro showed that the specific ASIC antagonist A-317567 (100 μM) did not significantly alter hypoxia-evoked activity in normal preparations but blocked ∼50% of the hypoxic response following CH. Likewise, a high concentration of ibuprofen, which is known to block ASIC1a, reduced hypoxia-evoked CSN activity by ∼50% in CH preparations. Our findings indicate that CH induces inflammation-dependent phenotypic adjustments in chemoafferent neurons. Following CH, ASIC are important participants in chemotransmission between type I cells and chemoafferent nerve terminals, and these proton-gated channels appear to enhance chemoreceptor sensitivity.",2011,,"Liu X, He L, Dinger B, Fidone SJ.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3233826,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,uncertain,yes,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Methods used for measuring ASIC expression', 'Specific conditions for in vitro testing', 'Discussion on permeation properties of ibuprofen']","The study focuses on chronic hypoxia and ASIC expression, mentioning ibuprofen but not its permeation properties or formulations relevant to the dataset.

Alpert and R.W. Walenga. Am. J. Physiol. 269 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 13): L734-L743, 1995]. Formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured tracheobronchial epithelial cells during ozone exposure was recently demonstrated (L.C. Chen and Q.Qu. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 143: 96-101, 1997). In the present study, we investigated if ROS generated by ozone-exposed human TE cells contribute to PGE2 production and/or CO inactivation and whether the delay in recovery of CO activity after ozone reflects impaired gene transcription and/or protein synthesis. Rapid, dose-dependent ROS generation, assessed by fluorescence of dihydrorhodamine 123, was detected in human TE monolayers exposed to 0.21-0.63 ppm ozone. In a different system, TE cells were exposed to air or 0.5 ppm ozone for 1 h by serial renewal/collection of an adherent film of media. Ozone-induced ROS formation, the transient increase and decline in PGE2, and CO inactivation were attenuated by an intracellular hydroxyl radical scavenger, 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea. Ibuprofen, a reversible CO inhibitor, prevented PGE2 release during ozone exposure (and hence autocatalytic CO inactivation) but not loss of CO activity. Although CO activity remained depressed for hours after ozone exposure, compared with air-exposed cultures, no differences were detected in mRNA and protein levels of prostaglandin endoperoxide G/H synthase 2 (PGHS-2), the only CO isoform present in human TE cells, or in the rate of de novo PGHS-2 synthesis. Our findings suggest that ozone-induced PGE2 production and CO inactivation are primarily the result of formation of intracellular oxidant molecules and that delayed recovery of CO activity in human TE cells after short-term ozone exposure is due to persistent inactivation of PGHS-2, rather than to interference with its synthesis.",1997,,"Alpert SE, Walenga RW, Jaspers I, Qu Q, Chen LC.",https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.1997.272.5.L879,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Detailed methods of CO activity measurement', 'Specific effects of ibuprofen on permeation characteristics', 'Formulations used in the study']","The study focuses on cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin production in human tracheal epithelial cells exposed to ozone, without direct relevance to ibuprofen permeation or release using diffusion cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of IL-1α production in the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to induce IL-1α in HaCaT cells, and this might be associated with the specific deficiency known to affect downstream signalling of the MEK/ERK pathway in these cells. The calcium ionophore, ionomycin, slightly enhanced the production of intracellular (icIL-1α), but this resulted in a necrotic release at higher concentrations. UV-B exposure significantly increased the production of icIL-1α in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal induction exhibited at 24 h with minimal necrotic and apoptotic effects. Validation of the HaCaT cell model indicated that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ibuprofen, and the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibited icIL-1α production, and this was associated with a slight inhibition of cell viability.

Targeted management of inflammation, therefore, is a plausible strategy to mitigate HIV risk and slow disease progression. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as hydroxychloroquine and aspirin have shown encouraging preliminary results in low-risk women by reducing systemic and genital immune activation. A topical NSAID, containing ibuprofen, is effective in treating vulvovaginal inflammation. Additionally, the glucocorticoids (GCs), prednisolone, and dexamethasone are used to treat HIV-associated immune activation. Collectively, these data inform on immune-modulating drugs to reduce HIV risk. However, the prolonged use of these pharmaceutical drugs is associated with adverse effects, both systemically and to a lesser extent topically. Natural products with their reduced side effects coupled with anti-inflammatory properties render them viable options. Lactic acid (LA) has immunomodulatory properties. LA regulates the genital microbiome by facilitating the growth of <i>Lactobacillus</i> species, while simultaneously limiting bacterial species that cause microbial dysbiosis and GI. Glycerol monolaurate, besides being anti-inflammatory, also inhibited SIV infections in rhesus macaques. The proposed pharmaceutical and natural products could be used in combination with either antiretrovirals for treatment or preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention. This review provides a summary on the associations between inflammation, HIV risk, and disease progression. Furthermore, we use the knowledge from immune quiescence to exploit the use of pharmaceutical and natural products as strategic interventions to manage inflammation, toward mitigating HIV infections.",2020,,"Cromarty R, Archary D.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/art/2020/8672850.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,uncertain,yes,uncertain,"['Formulation details of the topical NSAID containing ibuprofen', 'Measurable endpoints related to inflammation and HIV susceptibility', 'Specific methods used for permeation studies']",The abstract discusses topical NSAIDs and mentions ibuprofen but lacks clear focus on in vitro studies related to permeation or diffusion cells.

ESKAPE group of bacteria are associated with antibiotic resistance, and infections caused by these pathogens result in high mortality and morbidity. However, <i>de novo</i> synthesis of antibiotics is expensive and time-consuming since the development of a new drug has to go through several clinical trials. Repurposing of old drugs for the treatment of antimicrobial resistant pathogens has been explored as an alternative strategy in the field of antimicrobial drug discovery. Ten non-antimicrobial compounds were screened for antibacterial activity on two ESKAPE organisms, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The drugs used in this study were amodiaquine an antimalarial drug, probenecid used to prevent gout, ibuprofen a painkiller, 2-amino-5-chlorobenzaxazole used as a tool for assessing hepatic cytochrome P450 activity in rodents, ellargic acid an antioxidant, quercetin an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drug, N-N diacryloylpiperazine used to crosslink polyacrylamide gel in 2D-protein electrophoresis, epicatechin an antioxidant and antiviral drug, curcumin an anticancer drug, and quinine an antimalarial drug. Antibacterial susceptibility tests were carried out for the 10 compounds. Curcumin exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against both bacteria, with MICs of 50 <i>μ</i>g/ml and 100 <i>μ</i>g/ml for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>S. aureus</i>, respectively. Ellargic acid was found to have an MIC of 100 <i>μ</i>g/ml against <i>S. aureus.</i> Curcumin caused protein and nucleic acid leakage from the bacterial cell membrane in both bacterial species. When curcumin was combined with ciprofloxacin, it was found to enhance the antibacterial effects of ciprofloxacin.

Compared with other sports injuries, the injuries caused by piano practice are mainly chronic injuries caused by long-term strain of the upper limbs, and acute injuries rarely occur. The purpose of this study was to analyze the therapeutic effect of hand muscle injury caused by piano practice.<h4>Method</h4>A total of 60 patients with hand muscle injury caused by piano practice admitted to our hospital from January 2019 to June 2020 were selected. According to the number random grouping method, they were randomly divided into two groups. There were 30 patients in the observation group, including 20 males and 10 females, aged 24-53 (39.51 ± 7.01) years old, and the course of disease was 1-5 (3.24 ± 1.62) months. In the control group, there were 30 patients, including 18 males and 12 females, aged 24-56 (39.62 ± 7.17) years old, and the course of disease was 1.5-5 (3.14 ± 1.71) months. If the observation group experienced excessive pain, the group took ibuprofen sustained-release capsules. On weekdays, exercise your fingers 2-3 times per day. After the intervention, the wrist joint function score of the observation group was higher than that before the intervention.<h4>Results</h4>Before treatment, there was no significant difference in pain level scores between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). After treatment, the limb pain score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group. The effective rate of hand tendon rehabilitation in the observation group was 93.33%. The effective rate of hand tendon rehabilitation in the control group was 70.00%. The comparison results showed that there was statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The score of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group, with statistically significant differences (<i>P</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Piano workouts can cause hand muscle difficulties, which can be alleviated by daily finger gymnastics. Daily finger exercises are simple and not limited by time and place. Piano practitioners can use the spare time of daily training and performance to exercise for a long time, so as to prevent or recover finger muscle damage caused by piano practice.

The present study was designed to investigate the use of LSM as a mucoadhesive polymer using ibuprofen as a model drug. The mucilage was extracted following an aqueous extraction method and its percentage yield was found to be 13.2% w/w.

The microspheres were evaluated for various micromeritic properties and all the formulations exhibited free-flowing properties. Optical microscopic pictures of almost all the microspheres except F3 and F6 (which had more or less spherical shapes) were found to have irregular and discrete shapes.

Expression of p75(NTR) is lost as prostate cancer progresses and is minimal in several metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. NSAIDs induce p75(NTR) through activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, with a concomitant decrease in cell survival. Here, we show that treatment with R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen induces expression of the NSAID-activated gene-1 (Nag-1) protein, a divergent member of the TGF beta (TGF-β) family, in PC-3 cells. Using the selective pharmacologic inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190, and p38 MAPK-specific siRNA (small interfering RNA), we show that Nag-1 induction following NSAID treatment is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. p75(NTR)-specific siRNA pretreatment shows that Nag-1 induction by NSAIDs is downstream of p75(NTR) induction. Decreased survival of NSAID-treated cells is rescued by p75(NTR)-specific siRNA but not by Nag-1 siRNA. Transwell chamber and in vitro wound healing assays demonstrate decreased cell migration upon NSAID treatment. Pretreatment of PC-3 cells with p75(NTR) and Nag-1-specific siRNA shows that NSAID inhibition of cell migration is mediated by Nag-1 and p75(NTR).

In the present study, we have investigated systematically the influence of increasing amounts of the cosolvent ethanol on the solubility, ionization, and permeability characteristics of ibuprofen in silicone and in skin. The possibility of ibuprofen self-association was also examined. As the amount of ethanol was raised from 0 to 100%, ibuprofen solubility was enhanced 5,500-fold relative to its aqueous solubility. Up to 50%, the pK(a) of ibuprofen shifted from 4.44 to 5.68. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of ibuprofen in both monomer and dimer forms in vehicles containing 75 and 100% ethanol. In silicone membranes, the flux of ibuprofen increased 8-fold over the range of ethanol concentrations studied (0-100%) relative to aqueous solutions, with the highest flux observed for 100% ethanol. However, in skin, the flux of ibuprofen was optimal for 50:50 and 75:25 ethanol-water vehicles (>10-fold flux enhancement).

Propylene glycol (PG) has a long history of use as a component of topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations. In the present study we investigated the influence of PG on the solubility and membrane permeability characteristics of ibuprofen in silicone and skin using binary (PG:water) and ternary (ethanol:PG:water) solvent systems. Fluxes were maximum for 70:30 PG:water systems in silicone membrane; however, for experiments conducted with skin, the flux of ibuprofen systematically increased with increasing amounts of PG. For silicone membrane, the flux values of ibuprofen from ternary ethanol:PG:water (25:25:50 and 50:25:25) systems were 1.2- and 1.5-fold higher than the highest values observed from the PG:water systems. A comparison of the data from occluded versus non-occluded studies suggested that the ethanol content was the critical determinant of flux enhancement in these systems. For human skin, a PG:water (50:50) mixture enhanced ibuprofen flux to the same extent as the corresponding ethanol:PG:water (25:25:50) system. However, the ternary system, ethanol:PG:water (50:25:25), demonstrated the greatest enhancement. An analysis of the partition and diffusion parameters for experiments conducted with skin confirmed that the influence of PG in the PG:water systems is primarily on the solubility and partitioning behaviour of ibuprofen.

Participation of the cyclooxygenase pathway.,"Human peripheral blood leukocytes, activated by phorbol myristate acetate, disrupt canine sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport, in vitro, by an oxygen-derived free radical mechanism. Activated leukocytes significantly depress Ca++ uptake activity and Ca++ -stimulated, Mg++ -dependent ATPase activity. The depression is completely inhibited by sodium-azide (0.1 mM) or the combination of superoxide dismutase (10 micrograms/ml) and catalase (10 micrograms/ml). Exogenous hydrogen peroxide (0.441-4.41 mM) uncoupled Ca++ uptake activity from ATP hydrolysis, and this effect was inhibited by catalase. Mannitol alone did not inhibit the effects of activated leukocytes, but superoxide plus mannitol (20-100 mM) resulted in normal ATPase activity, while Ca++ uptake remained depressed. In the presence of indomethacin and ibuprofen, activated leukocytes depressed Ca++ uptake and had no effect on ATPase activity. 2-Amino-methyl-4-t-butyl-6-iodophenol (MK-447) further depressed Ca++ uptake and partially inhibited the effect on ATPase activity. Indomethacin plus catalase completely inhibited the effects of activated leukocytes on cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. We conclude, first, that activated leukocytes depress canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ transport by an oxygen-free radical mechanism with the generation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical.

Shrinkage behavior of the membrane in buffer at 37 degrees C was also evaluated. It was found that PLGA glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased with increasing PEG-g-CHN content in the composite membranes, which results in a decrease in tensile stress at break but an increase in tensile strain of the membranes. The degree of shrinkage of these composite membranes decreased from 76 to only 3% when the PEG-g-CHN content in the membranes increased from 10 to 30%. The presence of PEG-g-CHN significantly moderated the burst release rate of ibuprofen from the electrospun PLGA membranes.

MED,7697256,7697256.0,10.1164/ajrccm/151.4.1218,Paradoxic effect of ibuprofen on neutrophil accumulation in pulmonary and cutaneous inflammation.,"Evidence exists to suggest that the local accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary inflammation occurs by a different mechanism than in other microvascular beds. In the present study, this suggestion was investigated using the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen. This drug was used because in addition to inhibiting cyclooxygenase, it prevents several aspects of neutrophil function, including adhesion. Local inflammation in the lung and skin of the same rabbits was induced by the administration of C5a, and the effect of intravenous injection of ibuprofen on the accumulation of neutrophils at these two sites was examined. In the skin, neutrophil accumulation was inhibited by ibuprofen, and this appeared to be independent of cyclooxygenase blockade. A possible mechanism was prevention of neutrophil adherence to endothelium in postcapillary venules, and in vitro experiments showed that ibuprofen could entirely prevent neutrophil adherence, in addition to suppressing azurophil granule secretion and superoxide anion generation. However, the effect on adherence appeared to be independent of expression of the CD11/CD18 adhesion complex on the neutrophil. By contrast, in the pulmonary circulation of the same rabbit, C5a-induced neutrophil accumulation was enhanced by ibuprofen treatment. This was suggested to result from the prevention of thromboxane production, which normally serves to decrease local pulmonary blood flow to diminish delivery of neutrophils to the inflammatory site. Ibuprofen had no effect on retention of neutrophils in filters (models of pulmonary capillaries), suggesting that the drug was not enhancing the retention of neutrophils in capillaries on the first pass through the lung. Thus, it was possible that enhancement in the lung was caused by an increase in neutrophil supply. Because the accumulation of neutrophils in the skin is known to be dependent on the adherence phenomena, the paradoxic effects of ibuprofen on inflammation suggest that mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of neutrophils in cutaneous and pulmonary microcirculations are different.",1995,,"Hellewell PG, Young SK, Henson PM, Worthen GS.",https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.151.4.7697256,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Specific experimental methods used with ibuprofen', 'Details on in vitro experiments regarding ibuprofen', 'Quantitative results related to neutrophil accumulation', 'Formulations or concentrations of ibuprofen used']",The study focuses on the effects of ibuprofen on neutrophil accumulation rather than its permeation or release characteristics.

After washing, approximately 30 h were required before antibacterial activity recovered to its initial level. After culturing with topical corticosteroids (budesonide, triamcinolone, or beclomethasone, 0.1 microg/ml for 48 h), ASF antibacterial activity was 4- to 10-fold greater than the ASF from control monolayers. The increase in antibacterial activity was dose-dependent. The beta(2)-agonists salbutamol and terbutaline (100 microg/ml for 48 h) decreased ASF antibacterial activity by 5- to 8-fold. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ibuprofen and cromolyn sodium had no effect. Our results are most consistent with agonist-dependent changes in the composition of ASF antibacterial proteins.

Cellulose acetate/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (CA/PVP) blends were used to fabricate uniform nanofibers. Investigations on the physicochemical properties of CA/PVP solutions indicated that the addition of appropriate PVP improved the electrospinnability of original CA solutions. Detections on the physical states of IBU in medicated CA/PVP nanofibers suggested that IBU was uniformly distributed in nanofibers in an amorphous state. Comparing to IBU-loaded casting membrane, the medicated CA/PVP nanofibers provided a faster IBU diffusion manner and a better ex vitro skin permeation profile due to their high superficial areas and the amorphous IBU. Furthermore, CA/PVP nanofibers exhibited a high water vapor permeability, which could render an improved breathability to transdermal patches. In sum, the electrospun drug-loaded CA/PVP nanofibers exhibited great potentials to improve the thermodynamic stability and breathability of transdermal patches, which could be used to develop new types of transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS).",2013,,"Shi Y, Wei Z, Zhao H, Liu T, Dong A, Zhang J.",https://doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2013.7157,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,uncertain,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed methodology for diffusion study', 'Quantitative outcomes for skin permeation', 'Comparative data with other formulations']","The study focuses on the development of ibuprofen-loaded nanofibers for transdermal drug delivery, implicating diffusion and permeation evaluations, which are relevant for the dataset.",0.85

MED,3514678,3514678.0,10.1172/jci112431,Evidence that prostacyclin modulates the vascular actions of calcium in man.,"Increases in extracellular calcium (Ca++) can alter vascular tone, and thus may result in increased blood pressure (Bp) and reduced renal blood flow (RBF). Ca++ can stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and/or prostacyclin (PGI2) release in vitro, which may modulate Ca++ vascular effects. However, in man, the effect of Ca++ on PG release is not known. To study this, 14 volunteers received low-dose (2 mg/kg Ca++ gluconate) or high-dose (8 mg/kg) Ca++ infusions. The low-dose Ca++ infusion did not alter systemic or renal hemodynamics, but selectively stimulated PGI2, as reflected by the stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in urine (159 +/- 21-244 +/- 30 ng/g creatinine, P less than 0.02). The same Ca++ infusion given during cyclooxygenase blockade with indomethacin or ibuprofen was not associated with a rise in PGI2 and produced a rise in Bp and fall in RBF. However, sulindac, reported to be a weaker renal PG inhibitor, did not prevent the Ca++ -induced PGI2 stimulation (129 +/- 33-283 +/- 90, P less than 0.02), and RBF was maintained despite similar increases in Bp. The high-dose Ca++ infusion produced an increase in mean Bp without a change in cardiac output, and stimulated urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha to values greater than that produced by the 2-mg/kg Ca++ dose (330 +/- 45 vs. 244 +/- 30, P less than 0.05). In contrast, urinary PGE2 levels did not change. A Ca++ blocker, nifedipine, alone had no effect on Bp or urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels, but completely prevented the Ca++ -induced rise in Bp and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion (158 +/- 30 vs. 182 +/- 38, P greater than 0.2). However, the rise in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was not altered by the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin (159 +/- 21-258 +/- 23, P less than 0.02), suggesting that calcium entry and not alpha 1 receptor activation mediates Ca++ pressor and PGI2 stimulatory effects.

Lungs from rabbits exposed to 2,000 ppm-min phosgene were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 50 ml/min for 60 min. Phosgene caused no increase in lung generation of cyclooxygenase metabolites and no elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure, but markedly increased transvascular fluid flux (delta W = 31 +/- 5 phosgene vs. 8 +/- 1 g unexposed, P less than 0.001), permeability to albumin (125I-HSA) lung leak index 0.274 +/- 0.035 phosgene vs. 0.019 +/- 0.001 unexposed, P less than 0.01; 125I-HSA lavage leak index 0.352 +/- 0.073 phosgene vs. 0.008 +/- 0.001 unexposed, P less than 0.01), and lung malondialdehyde (50 +/- 7 phosgene vs. 24 +/- 0.7 mumol/g dry lung unexposed, P less than 0.01). Ibuprofen protected lungs from phosgene (delta W = 10 +/- 2 g; lung leak index 0.095 +/- 0.013; lavage leak index 0.052 +/- 0.013; and malondialdehyde 16 +/- 3 mumol/g dry lung, P less than 0.01). Because iron-treated ibuprofen failed to protect, we studied the effect of ibuprofen in several iron-mediated reactions in vitro. Ibuprofen attenuated generation of .OH by a Fenton reaction and peroxidation of arachidonic acid by FeCl3 and ascorbate. Ibuprofen also formed iron chelates that lack the free coordination site required for iron to be reactive.

MED,9710435,9710435.0,10.1172/jci2614,Ibuprofen inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-mediated Cl- secretion.,"We evaluated the acute effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion (Isc) in both colonic and airway epithelia. In T84 cells, ibuprofen inhibited the forskolin-dependent Isc in a concentration-dependent manner, having an apparent Ki of 142 microM. Salicylic acid inhibited Isc with an apparent Ki of 646 microM. We determined whether ibuprofen would also inhibit the forskolin-stimulated Isc in primary cultures of mouse trachea epithelia (MTE) and human bronchial epithelia (HBE). Similar to our results in T84 cells, ibuprofen (500 microM) inhibited the forskolin-induced Isc in MTEs and HBEs by 59+/-4% (n = 11) and 39+/-6% (n = 8), respectively. Nystatin was employed to selectively permeabilize the basolateral or apical membrane to determine the effect of ibuprofen on apical Cl- (ICl) and basolateral K+ (IK) currents after stimulation by forskolin. After forskolin stimulation, ibuprofen (500 microM) reduced both the ICl and IK; reducing ICl and IK by 60 and 15%, respectively. To determine whether this inhibition of ICl was due to the inhibition of CFTR, the effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on CFTR Cl- channels in excised, inside-out patches from L-cells were evaluated. Ibuprofen (300 microM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 60+/-16% and this was explained by a short-lived block (approximately 1.2 ms) which causes an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.07+/-0.04 pA to 0.59+/-0.04 pA (n = 3). Similarly, salicylic acid (3 mM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 50+/-8% with an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.08+/-0.03 pA to 0.48+/-0.06 pA (n = 4). Based on these results, we conclude that the NSAIDs ibuprofen and salicylic acid inhibit cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion in human colonic and airway epithelia via a direct inhibition of CFTR Cl- channels as well as basolateral membrane K+ channels. This may reduce their efficacy in conjunction with other therapeutic strategies designed to increase CFTR expression and/or function in secretory epithelia.",1998,,"Devor DC, Schultz BD.",http://www.jci.org/articles/view/2614/files/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific experimental setup', 'Data on permeation characteristics']",The study focuses on the inhibitory effects of ibuprofen on chloride secretion rather than its permeation or release characteristics in diffusion cells.

Early studies investigated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as indomethacin, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and naproxen, which had no benefit. More recently, protective effects of diclofenac and NSAIDs in the fenamate group have been reported. Diclofenac decreased the frequency of AD significantly compared to other NSAIDs in a large retrospective cohort study. Diclofenac and fenamates share similar chemical structures, and evidence from cell and mouse models suggests that they inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory mediators from microglia with leads to the reduction of AD pathology.

Ibuprofen (IBF) is known to be used to treat inflammatory diseases, but when administered orally, high concentrations can cause some adverse problems. In this work, the incorporation of IBF in the NRL membranes was evaluated by physical-chemical, <i>in vitro</i> permeation, hemocompatibility and molecular modeling assays. In addition, the <i>in vitro</i> release profile of IBF in acid and basic media was analyzed during 96 h. The IBF-NRL membrane exhibited the absence of intermolecular bonding that could hinder drug release and presented compatible mechanical properties for applications as a cutaneous adhesive (0.58 and 1.12 MPa to Young's modulus and rupture tension, respectively). The IBF-NRL system did not present a significant hemolysis degree (1.67%) within 24 h. The release test indicated that in the first hours of the study, 48.5% IBF was released at basic pH and 22.5% at acidic pH, which is characteristic of a burst effect. Then, a stable release profile was observed until the end of the assay, with total IBF release of 60% in alkaline medium and 50% in acidic medium. The drug permeation results indicated that the IBF-NRL membranes can be used for the local skin treatment with permeation of 3.11% of IBF. Dynamic Molecular simulations indicated a pronounced electric dipole in the ionized form of IBF, which suggests a more effective interaction with water, explaining the efficient drug release in alkaline solutions.

Dietary lipids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a published track record of providing protection against gastrointestinal malignancies. In this regard, we examined the effects of membrane plasmalogens and ibuprofen on regulation of cellular levels of diamines, polyamine mediators that are augmented in cancer cells. For these studies we utilized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and NRel-4 cells, a CHO cell line with defective plasmalogen synthesis.<h4>Results</h4>NRel-4 cells, which possess cellular plasmalogen levels that are 10% of control CHO cells, demonstrated 2- to 3-fold increases in cellular diamine levels. These diamine levels were normalized by plasmalogen replacement and significantly reduced by ibuprofen. In both cases the mechanism of action appears to mainly involve increased diamine efflux via the diamine exporter. The actions of ibuprofen were not stereospecific, supporting previous studies that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition is unlikely to be involved in the ability of NSAIDs to reduce intracellular diamine levels.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data demonstrate that ibuprofen, a drug known to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, reduces cellular diamine levels via augmentation of diamine efflux. Similarly, augmentation of membrane plasmalogens can increase diamine export from control and plasmalogen-deficient cells. These data support the concept that membrane transporter function may be a therapeutic point of intervention for dietary and pharmacological approaches to cancer chemoprevention.",2011,,"Wood PL, Khan MA, Smith T, Goodenowe DB.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-511X-10-214,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,uncertain,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'In vitro permeation methods used', 'Specifics on cell types and conditions', 'Measurement techniques for diamine levels']","The study focuses on the biochemical effects of ibuprofen on cellular diamine levels rather than its permeation or release characteristics.

However in gliomas the role of this prostanoid is poorly understood. Here, we report on the proliferative, migratory, and apoptotic effects of PGE(1), PGE(2) and Ibuprofen (IBP) observed in the T98G human glioma cell line in vitro.<h4>Methods</h4>T98G human glioma cells were treated with IBP, PGE(1) or PGE(2) at varying concentrations for 24-72 hours. Cell proliferation, mitotic index and apoptotic index were determined for each treatment. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity was measured using fluorescent probes in live cells (FITC-LEHD-FMK and FITC-DEVD-FMK respectively). The migratory capacity of the cells was quantified using a scratch migration assay and a transwell migration assay.<h4>Results</h4>A significant decrease was seen in cell number (54%) in the presence of 50 μM IBP. Mitotic index and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation were also decreased 57% and 65%, respectively, by IBP. The apoptotic index was increased (167%) and the in situ activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was evident in IBP treated cells. The inhibition of COX activity by IBP also caused a significant inhibition of cell migration in the monolayer scratch assay (74%) and the transwell migration assay (36%). In contrast, the presence of exogenous PGE(1) or PGE(2) caused significant increases in cell number (37% PGE(1) and 45% PGE(2)). When mitotic index was measured no change was found for either PG treatment. However, the BrdU incorporation rate was significantly increased by PGE(1) (62%) and to a greater extent by PGE(2) (100%). The apoptotic index was unchanged by exogenous PGs. The addition of exogenous PGs caused an increase in cell migration in the monolayer scratch assay (43% PGE(1) and 44% PGE(2)) and the transwell migration assay (28% PGE(1) and 68% PGE(2)).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study demonstrated that treatments which alter PGE(1) and PGE(2) metabolism influence the proliferative and apoptotic indices of T98G glioma cells.

Accumulation of cerebral vascular fibrillar Abeta is implicated in promoting local neuroinflammation, causes marked degeneration of smooth muscle cells, and can lead to loss of vessel wall integrity with hemorrhage. However, the relationship between cerebral vascular fibrillar Abeta-induced inflammatory responses and localized cytotoxicity in the vessel wall remains unclear.Steroidal-based anti-inflammatory agents, such as dexamethasone, have been reported to reduce neuroinflammation and hemorrhage associated with CAA. Nevertheless, the basis for the beneficial effects of steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment with respect to local inflammation and hemorrhage in CAA is unknown. The cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cell system is a useful in vitro model to study the pathogenic effects of Abeta in CAA. To examine the possibility that dexamethasone may influence CAA-induced cellular pathology, we investigated the effect of this anti-inflammatory agent on inflammatory and cytotoxic responses to Abeta by HCSM cells.<h4>Methods</h4>Primary cultures of HCSM cells were treated with or without pathogenic Abeta in the presence or absence of the steroidal anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin or ibuprofen. Cell viability was measured using a fluorescent live cell/dead cell assay. Quantitative immunoblotting was performed to determine the amount of cell surface Abeta and amyloid beta-protein precursor (AbetaPP) accumulation and loss of vascular smooth cell alpha actin. To assess the extent of inflammation secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured by ELISA and active matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) levels were evaluated by gelatin zymography.<h4>Results</h4>Pathogenic Abeta-induced HCSM cell death was markedly reduced by dexamethasone but was unaffected by ibuprofen or indomethacin. Dexamethasone had no effect on the initial pathogenic effects of Abeta including HCSM cell surface binding, cell surface fibril-like assembly, and accumulation of cell surface AbetaPP. However, later stage pathological consequences of Abeta treatment associated with inflammation and cell degeneration including increased levels of IL-6, activation of MMP-2, and loss of HCSM alpha actin were significantly diminished by dexamethasone but not by indomethacin or ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results suggest that although dexamethasone has no appreciable consequence on HCSM cell surface fibrillar Abeta accumulation it effectively reduces the subsequent pathologic responses including elevated levels of IL-6, MMP-2 activation, and depletion of HCSM alpha actin. Dexamethasone, unlike indomethacin or ibuprofen, may diminish these pathological processes that likely contribute to inflammation and loss of vessel wall integrity leading to hemorrhage in CAA.",2006,,"Previti ML, Zhang W, Van Nostrand WE.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-3-18,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,IVRT,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Comparison of ibuprofen with dexamethasone', 'Experimental conditions for using ibuprofen']","The study focuses on dexamethasone and its effects on smooth muscle cells with a mention of ibuprofen.

Samples of the receptor fluids were taken at predefined times over 6 hours and were analysed by UV-VIS high-performance liquid-chromatography. Histological examinations after methylene blue application were additionally performed to gather information about barrier disruption.<h4>Results</h4>Despite no visible pores in the stratum corneum, the microneedle pretreatment resulted in a twofold (200 μm) and threefold higher (300 μm) flux through the pretreated skin samples compared to untreated skin samples for ibuprofen and ketoprofen (LogK(ow) > 3, melting point < 100°C). The flux of the hydrophilic compounds diclofenac and paracetamol (logK(ow) < 1, melting point > 100°C) increased their amount by four (200 μm) to eight (300 μm), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Commercially available microneedle rollers with 200-300 μm long needles enhance the drug delivery of topically applied non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and represent a valuable tool for percutaneous permeation enhancement particularly for substances with poor permeability due to a hydrophilic nature and high melting points.",2012,,"Stahl J, Wohlert M, Kietzmann M.",https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/2050-6511-13-5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,no,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific experimental conditions', 'Complete data on permeation rates', 'Comparison metrics with other compounds']","The study directly examines ibuprofen's permeation through Franz-type diffusion cells, providing valuable insights into its permeability enhancement.

MED,16542487,16542487.0,10.1186/cc4850,Fatality after deliberate ingestion of sustained-release ibuprofen: a case report.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug available over the counter and on prescription for the management of pain and inflammation. Severe toxicity is rare following deliberate self-poisoning with ibuprofen, and patients are usually either asymptomatic or develop only mild gastrointestinal toxicity. Although there have been nine other reported fatalities, co-existent factors have probably contributed to all of these deaths. We report here a fatality from isolated toxicity following self-poisoning with sustained-release ibuprofen.<h4>Case report</h4>A 26-year-old female presented after deliberate ingestion of up to 105 g sustained-release ibuprofen, with a reduced level of consciousness, severe metabolic acidosis and haemodynamic compromise. Despite intensive supportive management, gut decontamination with multidose activated charcoal and correction of the metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate and haemofiltration, the patient did not survive. The ibuprofen concentration ante mortem on presentation in peripheral blood was 760 mg/l and the concentrations post mortem were 518 mg/l in peripheral blood, 74 mg/kg in liver extract and 116 mg/l in the gastric contents.<h4>Discussion</h4>Most patients with ibuprofen poisoning are either asymptomatic or have mild gastrointestinal symptoms; severe poisoning with ibuprofen is rare.

Although the NF-κB pathway is involved in an increase in CGRP levels and activation of the trigeminal system in the NTG model, the relationship between NTG and neuroinflammation remains unclear. This study aimed to optimize a chronic NTG rat model with hyperalgesia and the ethological capacity for estimating migraine therapies and to further explore the underlying mechanism of NTG-induced migraine.<h4>Methods</h4>Rats were administered different doses of NTG s.c. daily or every 2 d; 30 min and 2 h later, the mechanical threshold was tested. After 9 d, the rats were injected with EB or Cy5.5 for the permeability assay. The other animals were sacrificed, and then, brainstem and caudal trigeminal ganglion were removed to test CGRP, c-Fos and NOS activity; Cytokines levels in the tissue and serum were measured by ELISA; and NF-κB pathway and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-related indicators were analyzed using western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe microglial polarization and IL-17A<sup>+</sup> T cell migration in the medulla oblongata.<h4>Results</h4>NTG (10 mg/kg, s.c., every 2 d for a total of 5 injections) was the optimal condition, resulting in progressive hyperalgesia and migraine behavior. TNC neuroinflammation with increases in cytokines, CGRP and c-Fos and activation of the NF-κB pathway was observed, and these changes were alleviated by ibuprofen. Furthermore, NTG administration increased BBB permeability by altering the levels functional proteins (RAGE, LRP1, AQP4 and MFSD2A) and structural proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and VE-cadherin-2) to increase peripheral IL-17A permeation into the medulla oblongata, activating microglia and neuroinflammation, and eventually causing hyperalgesia and migraine attack.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study confirmed that NTG (10 mg/kg, s.c., every 2 d for a total of 5 injections) was the optimal condition to provoke migraine, resulting in mechanical hyperalgesia and observable migraine-like behavior. Furthermore, IL-17A crossed the blood-brain barrier into the medulla oblongata, triggering TNC activation through microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.

Bladder inflammation reduces prostasin expression and a loss of prostasin expression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human bladder transitional cell carcinomas. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the incidence of various cancers including bladder cancer, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of NSAIDs are not fully understood.<h4>Methods</h4>The normal human bladder urothelial cell line UROtsa, the normal human trophoblast cell line B6Tert-1, human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell lines UM-UC-5 and UM-UC-9, and the human breast cancer cell line JIMT-1 were used for the study. Expression changes of the serine proteases prostasin and matriptase, and cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) in these cells following ibuprofen treatments were analyzed by means of reverse-transcription/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunoblotting. The functional role of the ibuprofen-regulated prostasin in epithelial tight junction formation and maintenance was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and epithelial permeability in the B6Tert-1 cells. Prostasin's effects on tight junctions were also evaluated in B6Tert-1 cells over-expressing a recombinant human prostasin, silenced for prostasin expression, or treated with a functionally-blocking prostasin antibody. Matriptase zymogen activation was examined in cells over-expressing prostasin.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen increased prostasin expression in the UROtsa and the B6Tert-1 cells. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was up-regulated at both the mRNA and the protein levels in the UROtsa cells by ibuprofen in a dose-dependent manner, but was not a requisite for up-regulating prostasin expression. The ibuprofen-induced prostasin contributed to the formation and maintenance of the epithelial tight junctions in the B6Tert-1 cells. The matriptase zymogen was down-regulated in the UROtsa cells by ibuprofen possibly as a result of the increased prostasin expression because over-expressing prostasin leads to matriptase activation and zymogen down-regulation in the UROtsa, JIMT-1, and B6Tert-1 cells. The expression of prostasin and matriptase was differentially regulated by ibuprofen in the bladder cancer cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ibuprofen has been suggested for use in treating bladder cancer.

In this study the immunosuppressive effects of G. segetum and its constituents were investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>Isolation of compounds from G. segetum leaves was conducted using vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) and column chromatography (CC). Two new compounds, namely 4,5,4'-trihydroxychalcone and 8,8'-(ethene-1,2-diyl)-dinaphtalene-1,4,5-triol, together with stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were isolated from G. segetum methanol extract and their structures were determined spectroscopically. The presence of gallic acid and rutin in the extract was determined quantitatively by a validated HPLC method. G. segetum methanol extract and its constituents were investigated for their effects on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, β2 integrin (CD18) expression, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), lymphocytes proliferation, cytokine release and nitric oxide (NO) production of phagocytes.<h4>Results</h4>All the samples significantly inhibited all the innate immune responses tested except CD 18 expression on surface of leukocytes. Among the samples, 8,8'-(ethene-1,2-diyl)-dinaphtalene-1,4,5-triol exhibited the strongest inhibitory on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, ROS and NO production. The compound exhibited exceptionally strong inhibitions on ROS and chemotaxis activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values lower than the positive controls, aspirin and ibuprofen, respectively. 4,5,4'-Trihydroxychalcone revealed the strongest immunosuppressive activity on proliferation of lymphocytes (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.52 μM) and on release of IL-1β (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 6.69 μM).

It can produce strong firepower, infrared thermal radiation, and medicinal effects when burning on the acupoints. Thunder-fire moxibustion is commonly used in patients with neck pain, but its efficacy has rarely been systematically demonstrated. We designed a randomized trial of thunder-fire moxibustion on cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR) to investigate whether it is more effective than ibuprofen sustained-release capsules.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred patients will be recruited and randomly divided into thunder-fire moxibustion and ibuprofen groups. The intervention consists of ten treatments and will last for 2 weeks. The Yasuhisa Tanaka 20 Score Scale is used as the primary outcome measure. It contains a combination of the self-conscious symptom in patients, objective clinical evaluation from doctors, and social evaluation (the ability to work and live). The objective and comprehensive evaluation of CSR patients before and after treatment is particularly needed. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2), Neck Disability Index score scale (NDI), and the Quality of Life Assessment (SF-36) are applied as secondary outcome measures. The assessment will take place at the baseline and the first and second weekends of treatment. If an adverse event (AEs) occurs, it will be reported.<h4>Discussion</h4>The aim of this trial is to determine whether thunder-fire moxibustion is more effective than ibuprofen in the treatment of patients with CSR.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn), ChiCTR1800018820.

Indirect stimuli either non-allergic/non-IgE mediated (e.g. exercise, mannitol) or allergic/IgE mediated (i.e. allergen) trigger mast cells to release bronchoconstricting mediators (e.g. cysteinyl leukotrienes, histamine). Performing repeat challenges within a short timeframe (e.g. 3 h) with non-allergic indirect stimuli results in a diminished, refractory response to the second challenge that is inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Cross refractoriness occurs between indirect stimuli. It follows that repeat bronchoprovocation with allergen might exhibit refractoriness that might be altered by ibuprofen. We assessed the response to a second allergen challenge performed 24 h after an initial allergen challenge to determine if the response is refractory. If refractoriness developed, the study aimed to determine whether a single dose of ibuprofen would alter the refractory response to the second allergen challenge. In the absence of a refractory response, the study design allowed for the assessment of the effect of ibuprofen on allergen challenge outcomes, including indices of airway inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>Thirteen mild atopic asthmatics were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo was administered 1 h prior to the first of two allergen challenges, performed 24 h apart. Blood and sputum eosinophils, airway responsiveness to methacholine and levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide were assessed before and 7 h after each allergen challenge. All data were log transformed and differences in geometric means were analyzed by paired t-tests.<h4>Results</h4>After placebo, early asthmatic responses for the two challenges were not significantly different (p = 0.82). A single 400 mg dose of ibuprofen decreased both the early (p = 0.03; n = 12) and late asthmatic responses (p = 0.03; n = 3).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Allergen challenges conducted 24 h apart do not exhibit refractoriness. Single dose ibuprofen inhibits early and late asthmatic responses to allergen bronchoprovocation.

Despite therapeutic advances, the etiology of refractory vasculitides remains incompletely understood. Recently, (non)immunological mechanisms bypassing T cells and IgE have been proposed to explain resistance to standard immunosuppressants. Herein, we report a case of refractory drug-induced systemic small-vessel vasculitis with varied extracutaneous manifestations and incorporate multiple sources of data to provide detailed accounts of complex (non)immunological phenomena involved in this case. Study objectives are to provide an insight about rare presentations of commonly used drugs, upgrade the pathophysiological concepts of drug-induced vasculitis, raise need for further investigation to define causes and risk factors for refractory vasculitis, and discuss most of the current knowledge suggesting novel therapeutic approaches to treat this vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of the two flares of systemic small-vessel vasculitis in a single patient in response to clopidogrel and ticagrelor exposure, respectively. However, this report is limited by attribution/observer bias.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We herein report a 24-year-old Caucasian male student with a medical history of mild seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, tension-type headaches, posttraumatic arterial stenosis, and previous exposure to ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, and mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine who suffered largely from acute urticaria and dyspnea after 20 days of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel introduction. A skin punch biopsy confirmed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Serologic antibody testing, complement analysis, microbiologic testing, and cancer biomarkers revealed no abnormalities. Regarding the patient's medical history, both acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were exchanged for ticagrelor. Furthermore, the addition of naproxen, cyclosporine, bilastine, prednisolone, and montelukast resulted in complete recovery. After 7 days, diarrhea and hematuria occurred. Urinalysis and computed tomography showed reversible proteinuria with gross hematuria and hypodense changes in kidney medulla, respectively, associated with discontinuation of ticagrelor and naproxen. In addition, the patient recovered completely without any immunosuppression up-titration.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case highlights the role of clopidogrel and ticagrelor as possible triggering agents for systemic small-vessel vasculitis and offers an insight into novel therapeutic strategies for refractory vasculitides.

The elderly are at significant risk for developing pulmonary disorders and infectious diseases, but the contribution of inflammation in the pulmonary environment has received little attention. In this study, we demonstrate that the lungs of old mice have elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and a resident population of highly activated pulmonary macrophages that are refractory to further activation by IFN-γ. The impact of this inflammatory state on macrophage function was determined in vitro in response to infection with M.tb. Macrophages from the lungs of old mice secreted more proinflammatory cytokines in response to M.tb infection than similar cells from young mice and also demonstrated enhanced M.tb uptake and P-L fusion.

MED,14727861,14727861.0,10.1208/pt020424,Influence of ibuprofen as a solid-state plasticizer in Eudragit RS 30 D on the physicochemical properties of coated beads.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the physicochemical properties of nonpareil beads coated with Eudragit RS 30 D containing ibuprofen as a multifunctional agent. The influence of the concentration of ibuprofen in the film coating and the effect of the coating level on drug release from coated beads was determined in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer solution. The influence of storage time at 23 degrees C and 60 degrees C on the release of ibuprofen from coated beads was also investigated. The thermal properties of the films were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to image the surface morphology of the coated beads. Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of Eudragit RS 30 D and ibuprofen. Results from the dissolution studies demonstrated that increasing the amount of ibuprofen in the polymeric film reduced the rate of drug release, mainly because of a more complete coalescence of the polymeric particles of the latex dispersion. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of Eudragit RS 30 D films decreased and the surface of the coated beads became smoother as the concentration of ibuprofen was increased. Hydrogen bonding between the polymer and ibuprofen was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. No significant differences were found in drug dissolution between the coated beads stored at 23 degrees C for 12 months and those stored at 60 degrees C for 12 hours. The results of this study demonstrated that the ibuprofen plasticized the Eudragit RS 30 D.

Ibuprofen was used as the model drug and microcrystalline cellulose/sodium carboxymethyl cellulose hydrocolloid (Avicel(R) RC-581 or CL-611) was present as the diluent/binder. The mixture, in 1:1 ratio, was blended with and without 1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and spheronized with the rotor disk insert, using either water or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) as binder. Fluid-bed machines (Vector/Freund Flo-Coater model) FLM-1 (with 9-inch rotor insert for 0.75 kg) and FLM-15 (with a 12-inch and 19-inch rotor inserts for 1 kg and 5, 10 kg, respectively) were used. The critical process parameters included inlet air temperature, rotor disk speed and configuration, air flow, and rate of binder application. The 1 kg batch containing SLS that was made with 12-inch smooth stainless steel or waffle teflon plates rotating at 500 rpm had desirable characteristics. The sphericity values were 0.88 and 0.91, with percent yield of 85.4 and 91.2 and drug content values of 94.47% and 91.44%, respectively. The spheroids showed good flow properties with respective rapid drug release (Q20 = 83.27 and 91.75). No difference was seen in the Avicel RC-581 and CL-611.

Both transport a variety of monocarboxylates in a Na(+)-coupled manner. They are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, thyroid, brain, and retina. SLC5A8 is localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to neurons and the retinal pigment epithelium. The physiologic functions of SLC5A8 include absorption of short-chain fatty acids in the colon and small intestine, reabsorption of lactate and pyruvate in the kidney, and cellular uptake of lactate and ketone bodies in neurons. It also transports the B-complex vitamin nicotinate. SLC5A12 is also localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and proximal tubule. In the brain and retina, its expression is restricted to astrocytes and Müller cells. SLC5A8 also functions as a tumor suppressor; its expression is silenced in tumors of colon, thyroid, stomach, kidney, and brain. The tumor-suppressive function is related to its ability to mediate concentrative uptake of butyrate, propionate, and pyruvate, all of which are inhibitors of histone deacetylases. SLC5A8 can also transport a variety of pharmacologically relevant monocarboxylates, including salicylates, benzoate, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and fenoprofen, also interact with SLC5A8. These drugs are not transportable substrates for SLC5A8, but instead function as blockers of the transporter.

Increased curing times resulted in decreased drug release rates from Eudragit NE-coated beads. However, an increase in drug release rates was noticed at longer curing times and higher temperatures for the Eudragit RS coating system. The surface morphological changes of the film-coated beads revealed that there were no visible macroscopic changes as a result of curing. The absence of any ibuprofen melting peak in the DSC thermograms of cured NE and RS coated beads confirmed that there was no surface crystallization of ibuprofen. These results indicated that the increase in drug release rates from RS coated pellets, when subjected to long curing times, resulted from loss of plasticizer. Free films of Eudragit NE exhibited an increase in tensile strength with increased curing times, whereas Eudragit RS free films showed a decrease in tensile strength beyond 4 h of curing at 70 and 90 degrees C. The film thicknesses and weights of free films of Eudragit RS prepared with triethyl citrate plasticizer were found to change more dramatically with curing than did free films of Eudragit RS prepared with ibuprofen as the plasticizer.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of a series of lactate esters as penetration enhancers on the in vitro skin permeation of four drugs with different physicochemical properties, including ibuprofen, salicylic acid, dexamethasone and 5-fluorouracil. The saturated donor solutions of the evaluated drugs in propylene glycol were used in order to keep a constant driving force with maximum thermodynamic activity. The permeability coefficient (K(p)), skin concentration of drugs (SC), and lag time (T), as well as the enhancement ratios for K(p) and SC were recorded. All results indicated that lactate esters can exert a significant influence on the transdermal delivery of the model drugs and there is a structure-activity relationship between the tested lactate esters and their enhancement effects. The results also suggested that the lactate esters with the chain length of fatty alcohol moieties of 10-12 are more effective enhancers. Furthermore, the enhancement effect of lactate esters increases with a decrease of the drug lipophilicity, which suggests that they may be more efficient at enhancing the penetration of hydrophilic drugs than lipophilic drugs.

Unfortunately, this type of testing often yields permeation data that suffer from poor reproducibility. Moreover, this feature frequently occurs when synthetic membranes are used as barriers, in which case biological tissue-associated variability has been removed as an artefact of total variation. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the influence of a full-validation protocol on the performance of a tailor-made array of Franz diffusion cells (GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, UK) available in our laboratory. To this end, ibuprofen was used as a model hydrophobic drug while synthetic membranes were used as barriers. The parameters investigated included Franz cell dimensions, stirring conditions, membrane type, membrane treatment, temperature regulation and sampling frequency. It was determined that validation dramatically reduced derived data variability as the coefficient of variation for steady-state ibuprofen permeation from a gel formulation was reduced from 25.7% to 5.3% (n = 6).

Therefore, the in vitro permeation of excised porcine ear skin by drugs with different polarities [aminopyrine (AMP), antipyrine (ANP), methylparaben (MP), and ibuprofen (IP)] was analyzed under a constant skin surface temperature with different temperatures and humidities to reveal the effects of temperature and humidity on the skin permeation enhancement effects. Applied formulations were prepared by mixing the drug and a hydrophilic vehicle containing glycerin. The disposition-distance profiles of water and the humectant glycerin in the stratum corneum were also investigated using confocal Raman microscopy. High absolute humidity (AH) significantly contributed to the high skin penetration of the hydrophilic penetrants AMP, ANP, and MP but not the hydrophobic penetrant IP. An increase in the partition parameter and a decrease in the diffusivity parameter occurred with an increase in AH, independent of drug polarity. Moreover, we found that dew condensation induced by high AH on temperature-controlled skin surface may effectively increase water content and may provide higher glycerin distribution in the skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Increasing the amount of water and hydrophilic vehicles such as glycerin in the stratum corneum may enhance the permeation of hydrophilic penetrants AMP, ANP, and MP. These data suggested a dew condensation on the skin surface induced by high AH at a constant skin surface temperature would be important to enhance hydrophilic penetrants.",2019,,"Iikura H, Uchida K, Ogawa-Fuse C, Bito K, Naitou S, Hosokawa M, Uchida T, Sano T, Todo H, Sugibayashi K.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1208/s12249-019-1481-1.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Specific experimental conditions', 'Formulation details', 'Quantitative data for ibuprofen permeation']","The study includes ibuprofen in its analysis of skin permeation, employs IVPT methods, and discusses relevant formulations.

Ibuprofen is a commonly used anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic drug; however, because of its short biological half-life, it must be frequently administered orally and is highly irritating to the digestive tract. To prepare a novel transdermal delivery system for ibuprofen, a microemulsion was used as a drug carrier and dispersed in a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (ME/Gel) to increase percutaneous drug absorption while avoiding gastrointestinal tract irritation. The prepared microemulsion had a droplet size of ~ 90 nm, and the microemulsion had good stability in the hydrogel. Rheological tests revealed that the ME/Gel is a pseudoplastic fluid with decreased viscosity and increased shear rate. It displayed a certain viscoelasticity, and the microemulsion distribution displayed minor effects on the rheological characteristics of the hydrogel system. There was no significant difference in the rheology of the ME/Gel at 25°C and 32°C (normal skin surface temperature), which is beneficial for clinical application. Drug transdermal flux was significantly higher than that of the hydrogel and commercial cream groups (p < 0.01). The 24-h cumulative drug permeation amount was 1.42-fold and 2.52-fold higher than that of the hydrogel and cream groups, respectively. By loading into the ME/Gel, the cytotoxicity of the drug to HaCaT cells was reduced. These results indicate that the prepared ME/Gel can effectively improve transdermal ibuprofen delivery and the biosafety of the drug and could therefore have applicability as a drug delivery system.",2019,,"Zhang Y, Zhang K, Wang Z, Hu H, Jing Q, Li Y, Guo T, Feng N.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1208/s12249-019-1584-8.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on the diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics on ibuprofen release rates', 'Comparative analysis of formulations', 'Rheological properties in relation to skin permeation']","The study focuses on a transdermal system for ibuprofen using diffusion methods, and discusses measurable outcomes like drug flux and cumulative permeation, indicating its relevance for the dataset.",0.9

The inclusion complex with HP-β-CD, as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced the aqueous solubility of ibuprofen by almost 30-fold compared to ibuprofen alone. Different grades of Carbopol (Carbopol 934P/Carbopol 974P/Carbopol 980 NF/Carbopol Ultrez 10 NF) and cellulose derivatives (HPMC K100M/HPMC K15M/HPMC K4M/HPMC E15LV/HPC) were evaluated for mucoadhesive gels incorporating the inclusion complex. The central composite design generated by Design-Expert was employed to optimize the mucoadhesive gel using two independent variables (a varying combination of two gelling agents) on three dependent variables (drug content and in vitro drug release at 6 h and 12 h). Except for the methylcellulose-based gels, most of the gels (0.5%, 0.75%, and 1% alone or as a mixture thereof) exhibited an extended-release of ibuprofen, ranging from 40 to 74% over 24 h and followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetics model. Using this test design, 0.95% Carbopol 934P and 0.55% HPC-L formulations were optimized to increase ibuprofen release, enhance mucoadhesion, and be non-irritating in ex vivo chorioallantoic membrane studies.

The hydrogen bond networks and internal chemistry structures of the DESs were measured by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and <sup>1</sup>H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR), which demonstrated the successful synthesis of DESs. The viscosity of DES was decreased from 10,324.9 to 3219.6 mPa s, while glass transition temperature (Tg) of the DESs was increased from - 60.8 to - 51.4 °C, as the added water was increased from 45 to 60%. The solubility of ibuprofen, norfloxacin, and nateglinide in DES with 45% of water were increased by 79.3, 44.1, and 3.2 times higher than that in water, respectively.

The aim of this study to develop emulgel and nanostructured lipid carrier NLC-based gel formulations containing ibuprofen, evaluate their mechanical properties, bioadhesive value and ex-vivo rabbit skin permeability. All formulations showed non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior and their viscosity values are suitable for topical application. The particle size of the nanostructured lipid carrier system was found to be 468 ± 21 nm, and the encapsulation efficiency was 95.58 ± 0.41%. According to the index of viscosity, consistency, firmness, and cohesiveness values obtained as a result of the back extrusion study, E2 formulation was found to be more suitable for transdermal application. The firmness and work of shear values of the E2 formulation, which has the highest viscosity value, were also found to be the highest and it was chosen as the most suitable formulation in terms of the spreadability test.

These pathological markers can contribute to the loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain. Interestingly, men have a 2-fold increased incidence for Parkinson's disease than women. Although the mechanisms underlying this sex difference remain elusive, we propose that the primary male sex hormone, testosterone, is involved. Our previous studies show that testosterone, through a putative membrane androgen receptor, can increase oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity in dopamine neurons. Based on these results, this study examines the role of nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and apoptosis in the deleterious effects of androgens in an oxidative stress environment. We hypothesize, under oxidative stress environment, testosterone via a putative membrane androgen receptor will exacerbate oxidative stress-induced NF-κB/COX2 signaling in N27 dopaminergic neurons, leading to apoptosis. Our data show that testosterone increased the expression of COX2 and apoptosis in dopamine neurons. Inhibiting the NF-κB and COX2 pathway with CAPE and ibuprofen, respectively, blocked testosterone's negative effects on cell viability, indicating that NF-κB/COX2 cascade plays a role in the negative interaction between testosterone and oxidative stress on neuroinflammation. These data further support the role of testosterone mediating the loss of dopamine neurons under oxidative stress conditions, which may be a key mechanism contributing to the increased incidence of Parkinson's disease in men compared with women.",2016,,"Holmes S, Singh M, Su C, Cunningham RL.",https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2015-1738,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Formulation details of ibuprofen used', ""Measurable endpoints related to ibuprofen's effects"", 'Details on the diffusion cell methodology']","The study discusses the effects of ibuprofen on cellular signaling, but it is not primarily focused on permeability or formulation information relevant to the dataset's criteria.",0.6

The solubility of ibuprofen sodium was determined at a range of pH values. Saturated solutions were then used to determine the influence of pH on diffusion across PDMS as a model membrane. The apparent partition coefficient of ibuprofen sodium between n-octanol and phosphate buffer at various pH values was also investigated. Organic salts of ibuprofen using ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine and ethylene diamine as counter-ions were synthesized and the influence of these counter-ions on the permeation of ibuprofen was studied. The presence of ion-pairing was confirmed using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Diffusion studies at different pH values (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0) indicated that ibuprofen sodium flux increased significantly with increasing pH from 4.0 to 7.0. Above pH 7.0 a decrease in diffusion was observed. The permeability coefficient increased with an increase in the amount of unionized acid. The apparent partition coefficient was directly related to the steady-state flux. The steady-state flux of ibuprofen increased up to 16-fold using different counter-ions. The highest flux was measured from ibuprofen triethylamine. The flux of ibuprofen salts across a lipophilic membrane can be increased by formation of ion-pairs.

The permeability of all drugs was remarkably increased by the treatment of skin with EtOH/Panasate 800 binary systems compared with either EtOH or Panasate 800 alone, and the effect reached a maximum in EtOH/Panasate 800 (40/60) system. With regard to this binary system, the skin permeation ratio or flux of the drug increased in the following order: salicyluric acid (SU) > salicylic acid (SA) > alclofenac (ALC) > ketoprofen (KP) > ibuprofen (IBU). The one-layer skin model was applied concerning the above skin permeation profiles of the five drugs. Diffusion parameter (D'), partition parameter (K'), and permeation constant (Kp = D' x K') were calculated using the Laplace-transformed equations with the aid of MULTI (FILT). It was well demonstrated that the reduction of lag time and the increase of flux caused by EtOH/Panasate 800 binary vehicle systems was due to an increase of D' value by Panasate 800 and K' value by EtOH, respectively, in the skin. Especially, the EtOH/Panasate 800 (40/60) binary vehicle system produced the largest Kp value in each drug.

Five-month-old YMP skin showed small variation with respect to drug permeation rates, if the region of skin site was the same. But skin from 6-month-old YMPs showed faster and varied permeation rates due to skin defects. In the case of hydrophilic drugs, no effects on permeation due to the region from which the skin was obtained were observed, although higher permeation rates were observed through the flank than through dorsal skin in the case of ibuprofen and ketoprofen. For YMP skin, the permeation coefficients of drugs were lower than those for hairless rat skin, especially for hydrophilic drugs. Compared with reported human data on permeation coefficients, the permeation coefficients of drugs through YMP skin were 1/2-1/8 of those through human skin, regardless of whether the drugs were hydrophilic or lipophilic.

High encapsulation efficiency and release control of drugs are essential for clinical application of liposomes. For efficient drug loading into liposomes, remote loading method using driving force like transmembrane gradients of pH and ions are utilized. Ions are called as ""trapping agents,"" which are also critical for the controlled release of drugs loaded into liposomes inside. It is difficult to apply ions as trapping agents to various drugs because of limited physicochemical compatibility between drugs and ions. Cyclodextrins (CDs) with hydrophobic cavity can make inclusion complexes with various hydrophobic compounds. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the potential of CDs as a novel trapping agent using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) and ibuprofen (IB), a weak acid hydrophobic drug. Encapsulation efficiency of IB in liposomes with pH gradient was approximately 27%, and it was enhanced by intraliposomal SBE-β-CD inclusion in addition to pH gradient, which was SBE-β-CD concentration-dependent. In liposomes with pH gradient, a large fraction of IB was released in a short time. This early-stage rapid IB release was significantly suppressed by the inclusion of SBE-β-CD inside liposomes. Thus, novel remote loading technology by intraliposomal SBE-β-CD enabled the efficient encapsulation of the hydrophobic drug into the aqueous phase of liposomes as well as their controlled release.

Three kinds of drugs, indomethacin, ibuprofen and sulfanilamide which have similar solubilities in a mixed organic solvent (ethanol-diethylcarbitol, 40:60 v/v), were selected to evaluate the drug penetration with or without 5% AZ. Transdermal delivery rates were determined at 27 and 37 degrees C by using an in vitro diffusion cell procedure and the abdominal full-thickness skin of hairless rat. The solubility of each of the three drugs in the solvent with AZ was similar to that without AZ. Ethanol in the vehicle penetrated through the skin prior to the drugs. Activation energies for the skin penetration of the three drugs in the presence of AZ were decreased compared to those in its absence. For all drugs the partition coefficients between the skin and vehicle with AZ were 2-80 times higher than those without it. The activity coefficients of drugs in the presence of AZ in the skin were 2-90 times lower than those without the enhancer.

Liquid paraffin (LP) was used as the oil, and indomethacin (IM), ketoprofen (KP), flurbiprofen (FP) and ibuprofen (IP) were used as model drugs. IM did not dissolve in LP, but solubilized when heated with HSL at a concentration of about 1% with 15% HSL at 95 degrees C. IM gel was thus prepared as follows: IM and HSL were mixed, added into LP, capped tightly, heated in a water bath and cooled. The consistency of the gel increased with increasing IM concentration, indicating some kind of interaction between IM and HSL. The release of IM from the IM gel was faster than that from a preparation in which IM was mixed in gel at room temperature (Gel + IM). The release rate of IM from IM gel was proportional to IM concentrations up to 1%, but became constant above that. Permeation of IM through hairless rat abdominal skin from IM gel was higher than that from the Gel + IM. The permeation rate was proportional to IM concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 0.5% in 15% HSL gel. KP and FP also solubilized in gel when subjected to the same procedure as IM, and their release and permeation increased when they were formulated as gels. However, no evident improvement of permeation was observed in the case of IP, which had high LP solubility. It was suggested that HSL showed no enhancing effect, but solubilized IM, KP or FP, leading to high permeation from the gel. After 3 months' storage, the permeation rate did not change for 0.5% IM in 15% HSL gel, but decreased for 1% IM in 15% HSL gel. This indicates that in the case of 1% IM in 15% HSL gel, IM is in a supersaturated state immediately after preparation and then recrystallizes with time.",1994,,"Henmi T, Fujii M, Kikuchi K, Yamanobe N, Matsumoto M.",https://doi.org/10.1248/cpb.42.651,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen release and permeation rates', 'Comparison of formulations', 'Statistical methods used for measurements', 'Long-term stability data']","The study directly investigates the permeation of ibuprofen through skin using an oily gel formulation, which is relevant for ongoing research in drug delivery systems.",0.9

We determined the permeation of both compounds from the IL through a silicone membrane selected as a model biological membrane, and mathematically analyzed the permeation data from the viewpoint of the thermodynamic activities of lidocaine, ibuprofen, and the IL. As a result, IL and ibuprofen diffusely permeated through the membrane in the case of applying IL preparations with a molar fraction of ibuprofen of 0.5 or higher. The IL was thought to separate into lidocaine and ibuprofen in the receiver. On the other hand, when applying IL preparations with a molar fraction of lidocaine of 0.5 or higher, IL and lidocaine permeated. The permeation rate of IL itself was maximized when the applied IL was prepared using equimolar amounts of lidocaine and ibuprofen, and it decreased when the fraction of lidocaine or ibuprofen increased by more than 0.5. Their membrane permeation rates increased with an increase in their activity, and no more increase was found when the drugs were saturated in the IL.

It was found in the test of rat edema induced by various phlogists that carrageenin and yeast-induced edemas were markedly inhibited by FP-70, whereas dextran, formalin, serotonin and bradykinin-induced edemas were scarcely inhibited by FP-70. The action of FP-70 was similar to that of soy bean trypsin inhibitor. However, FP-70 showed no effects on kinin synthetase and kininase. FP-70 showed a marked inhibition on prostaglandin synthesis. The inhibitory effect of FP-70 was 10.1, 96.5 and 2280.6 times as large as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid, respectively. FP-70 did not inhibit the permeability of dye induced by prostaglandin E2 in the rat skin. FP-70 inhibited the acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase activities of isolated lysosome of rat liver and also suppressed the release of acid phosphatase from the lysosome. These effects were similar to those of indomethacin. On the other hand, FP-70 suppressed markedly the heat-induced hemolysis of dog erythrocytes. The effect was similar to that of indomethacin and was 10 times stronger than those of ibuprofen, ibufenac and phenylbutazone. Activation of rat liver mitochondrial ATPase by FP-70 at a concentration of 10 muM was 74.7%, while indomethacin showed 37.8% activation at the same concentration. FP-70 as well as ibuprofen and phenylbutazone uncoupled the oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria.

In search for this mechanism we found that Abeta(1-42) oligomers, the assembly state correlating best with cognitive decline in AD, but not Abeta fibrils, induce a massive entry of Ca(2+) in neurons and promote mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload as shown by bioluminescence imaging of targeted aequorin in individual neurons. Abeta oligomers induce also mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release, apoptosis and cell death. Mitochondrial depolarization prevents mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, cytochrome c release and cell death.

Promoting regeneration of severed axons requires the inactivation of growth inhibitory influences from the tissue environment and stimulation of the neuron intrinsic growth potential. Especially glial cell derived factors, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, Nogo-A, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and myelin in general, prevent axon regeneration. Most of the glial growth inhibiting factors converge onto the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway in neurons. Although conditions in the injured nervous system are clearly different from those during neurite outgrowth in vitro, here we use a chemical approach to manipulate Rho/ROCK signalling with small-molecule agents to encourage neurite outgrowth in cell culture. The development of therapeutic treatments requires drug testing not only on neurons of experimental animals, but also on human neurons. Using human NT2 model neurons, we demonstrate that the pain reliever Ibuprofen decreases RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A GTPase) activation and promotes neurite growth. Inhibition of the downstream effector Rho kinase by the drug Y-27632 results in a strong increase in neurite outgrowth. Conversely, activation of the Rho pathway by lysophosphatidic acid results in growth cone collapse and eventually to neurite retraction. Finally, we show that blocking of Rho kinase, but not RhoA results in an increase in neurons bearing neurites.

Compared with commercial granular activated carbon (GAC), MSM-500 had a ~100 times higher sorption rate at neutral pH. IBP uptake by MSM-500 was thermodynamically favorable at room temperature, which was interpreted as indicating relatively weak bonding because the entropy (∆adsS, -0.07 J mol(-1) K(-1)) was much smaller. Five times recycling tests revealed that MSM-500 had 83-87% recovery efficiencies and slower uptake speeds due to slight deformation of the outer pore structure. In the IBP delivery test, MSM-500 drug loading was 41%, higher than the reported value of SBA-15 (31%).

Both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and isotherm data indicated that the high sorption capacity and density of IBP by MPPAC was primarily attributable to donor-acceptor complexes with the C = O group and dispersive π-π interactions with the carbon surface. Based on kinetic and repeated adsorption tests, pore diffusion was the rate-limiting step, and MPPAC-Fe(3.8%) had about 1.9~2.8- and 9.1~15.8-fold higher rate constants than MPPAC-Fe(8.6%) and palm shell-waste granular activated carbon (PGAC, avg. size 621 μm), respectively.

The Flu-AM1 and Ibu-AM5 derivatives of flurbiprofen and ibuprofen retain similar COX-inhibitory properties and are more potent inhibitors of FAAH than the parent compounds. However, little is known as to the nature of their interaction with FAAH, or to the importance of their chirality. This has been explored here.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>FAAH inhibitory activity was measured in rat brain homogenates and in lysates expressing either wild-type or FAAH(T488A)-mutated enzyme. Molecular modelling was undertaken using both docking and molecular dynamics. The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of Flu-AM1 inhibited rat FAAH with similar potencies (IC50 values of 0.74 and 0.99 μM, respectively), whereas the (S)-enantiomer of Ibu-AM5 (IC50 0.59 μM) was more potent than the (R)-enantiomer (IC50 5.7 μM). Multiple inhibition experiments indicated that both (R)-Flu-AM1 and (S)-Ibu-AM5 inhibited FAAH in a manner mutually exclusive to carprofen. Computational studies indicated that the binding site for the Flu-AM1 and Ibu-AM5 enantiomers was located between the acyl chain binding channel and the membrane access channel, in a site overlapping the carprofen binding site, and showed a binding mode in line with that proposed for carprofen and other non-covalent ligands. The potency of (R)-Flu-AM1 was lower towards lysates expressing FAAH mutated at the proposed carprofen binding area than in lysates expressing wild-type FAAH.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>The study provides kinetic and structural evidence that the enantiomers of Flu-AM1 and Ibu-AM5 bind in the substrate channel of FAAH.

In melanoma, despite recent advances in targeted therapy and immunomodulatory therapies, this cancer remains difficult to treat. Our previous studies show melanoma cells interact with skin cells in their invasion into tissue engineered skin and suggest inflammation stimulates invasion. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. To do this we developed a wounded and inflamed in vitro 3D melanoma model in which to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. The tissue engineered skin model was based on human de-epidermised acellular dermis to which keratinocytes, fibroblasts and three different melanoma cell lines were added in various combinations. A simple incisional wound was made in the model and TNF-α and fibrin were added to simulate conditions of inflammation. Topical ibuprofen in a hydrogel was added and the extent of melanoma invasion into the dermis was assessed under the various conditions. The results showed that penetration of two of the cell lines (HBL and A375SM) into the tissue engineered skin was exacerbated by wounding and ibuprofen significantly decreased invasion of A375SM cells and slightly reduced invasion of HBL cells. A third cell line, C8161, was aggressively invasive under all conditions to an extent that was not influenced by wounding, TNF-α or the addition of ibuprofen. In summary, the results for one these cell lines (and a trend for a second cell line) support the hypothesis that a wound environment is conducive to melanoma invasion but the local addition of an anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen may attenuate invasion.",2016,,"Marques CM, MacNeil S.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156931&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation and concentration', 'Methods for measuring melanoma invasion', 'Specific results on permeation through the skin model', 'Comparison of cell line responses', 'In vitro conditions description']","The study focuses on ibuprofen's effects within a tissue engineered skin model, highlighting significant interactions with melanoma cells and skin barriers, which aligns with permeation research.",0.9

For this purpose, octanol has been applied as an organic phase to extract IP and 4-IBAP from the aqueous solution due to high solubility of solutes in octanol. Finite element (FE) technique is used as a promising tool to simultaneously solve continuity and Navier-Stokes equations and their associated boundary conditions in tube, shell and porous membrane compartments of the PMC. The results demonstrated that the application of PMC and liquid-liquid extraction process can be significantly effective due to separating 51 and 54% of inlet IP and 4-IBAP molecules from aqueous solution, respectively. Moreover, the impact of various operational / functional parameters such as packing density, the number of fibrous membrane, the module length, the membrane porosity / tortuosity, and ultimately the aqueous solution flow rate on the molecular separation efficiency of IP and 4-IBAP is studied in more details.",2020,,"Pishnamazi M, Taghvaie Nakhjiri A, Sodagar Taleghani A, Ghadiri M, Marjani A, Shirazian S.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237271,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on membrane properties', 'Specific methodologies for ibuprofen separation', 'Measurable outcomes from experimental results', 'Formulation details of octanol used']","The study focuses on the separation of ibuprofen using membranes, but it does not appear to involve in vitro diffusion or release experiments relevant to Franz cells.",0.7

We studied the dynamics of ibuprofen decomposition and its relationship with the physiological status of bacteria and with additional carbon and energy sources. The involvement of cytoplasmic enzymes in ibuprofen biodegradation was confirmed. Within the tested actinobacteria, Rhodococcus cerastii IEGM 1278 was capable of complete oxidation of 100 μg/L and 100 mg/L of ibuprofen in 30 h and 144 h, respectively, in the presence of an alternative carbon source (n-hexadecane). Besides, the presence of ibuprofen induced a transition of rhodococci from single- to multicellular lifeforms, a shift to more negative zeta potential values, and a decrease in the membrane permeability. The initial steps of ibuprofen biotransformation by R. cerastii IEGM 1278 involved the formation of hydroxylated and decarboxylated derivatives with higher phytotoxicity than the parent compound (ibuprofen).

Andrographolide is a naturally derived bioactive compound with promising anti-inflammatory activity in many clinical studies. However, its cytokine-inhibiting activity, in direct comparison to commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), has not been extensively investigated in existing literature. The anti-inflammatory activities of andrographolide and common NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen were measured on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ induced RAW264.7 cells. The levels of PGE2, nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α & LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines on differentiated human macrophage THP-1 cells were measured against increasing concentrations of andrographolide and aforementioned NSAIDs. The associated mechanistic pathway was examined on NFκB using flow cytometry on the human endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM9) (E-selectin) transfected RAW264.7 cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Andrographolide exhibited broad and potent anti-inflammatory and cytokine-inhibiting activity in both cell lines by inhibiting the release of IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ, which are known to play a key role in the etiology of cytokine storm and the pathogenesis of inflammation. In comparison, the tested NSAIDs demonstrated weak or no activity against proinflammatory mediators except for PGE2, where the activity of andrographolide (IC50 = 8.8 μM, 95% CI = 7.4 to 10.4 μM) was comparable to that of paracetamol (IC50 = 7.73 μM, 95% CI = 6.14 to 9.73 μM). The anti-inflammatory action of andrographolide was associated with its potent downregulation of NFκB.

The method outlined in this article draws together a number of scientific techniques and makes use of generally unwanted biological tissues as a means of determining skin inflammation <i>ex vivo</i>, and focuses on probing aspects of the arachidonic acid inflammation pathway. Freshly excised skin contains elevated levels of short-lived inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and, under viable conditions, COX-2 and its eicosanoid products will continue to be produced until tissue necrosis, providing a window of time in which relative levels can be probed to determine exacerbation due to an upregulating factor or downregulation due the presence of an agent exerting anti-inflammatory activity. <i>Ex vivo</i> porcine skin, mounted in Franz diffusion cells, is dosed topically with the xenobiotic challenge and then techniques such as Western blotting and immunohistochemistry can then be used to probe relative COX-2 levels on a semi-quantitative or qualitative level. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or LCMS can be used to determine relative prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) levels. Thus far, the technique has been used to examine the effects of topically applied anti-inflammatories (betamethasone, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and methotrexate), natural products (fish oil, Devil's claw extract and pomegranate rind extract) and drug delivery vehicle (polyNIPAM nanogels). Topically applied xenobiotics that modulate factors such as COX-2 and PGE-2 must penetrate the intact skin, and this provides direct evidence of overcoming the ""barrier function"" of the stratum corneum in order to target the viable epidermis in sufficient levels to be able to elicit such effects.

With the melting temperature-membrane transport model, the flux ratio of enantiomer/racemate was calculated from their thermodynamic properties obtained by differential scanning calorimetry. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) study was performed to evaluate the interaction between the enantiomers and the SC. New fluorescent probes were designed and utilized in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) study for visualization of the enantioselective permeation of the enantiomers through the intact rabbit skin.<h4>Result</h4>The flux of (S)-ibuprofen through normal skin was significantly higher than that of (RS)-ibuprofen and (R)-ibuprofen (p < 0.05), whereas in damaged skin, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). The predicted flux ratio of (S)-ibuprofen/(RS)-ibuprofen (2.50) was in close agreement with the experimentally determined ratio (2.48). These results were supported by ATR-FTIR and CLSM studies that indicated that a chiral environment of the skin led to the enantioselective permeation of enantiomers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The chiral nature of the SC and the different physicochemical properties of the enantiomers should be taken into account in the assessment of different skin permeability of the racemate and enantiomers.

Pharmacological characterization of this behavior has implicated the spinal release of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and cyclooxygenase (COX) products. To address this hypothesis, we examined the effect of paw formalin injection on release of EAAs and prostaglandin E2-like immunoreactivity (PGE2-LI) from the spinal cord in unanesthetized rats using a dialysis probe placed in the lumbar subarachnoid space. To assess the contribution of spinal COX products, the effects of S(+)- and R(-)-ibuprofen (active and inactive COX inhibitors) were examined. Paw formalin injection evoked a biphasic spinal release of PGE2-LI with an increase above resting concentrations of 110% in the 0-10 min sample, and of 83% in the 20-30 min sample. Significantly increased release of glutamate (Glu; 110%) and aspartate (Asp; 112%) was only observed in the 0-10 min sample. Saline injection into the paw had no effect on behavior, PGE2-LI, or EAA release. Intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg, S(+)-ibuprofen reduced paw flinching, blocked the elevated levels of PGE2-LI, and suppressed Glu and Asp release to 50% of control. Intrathecal delivery of 10 micrograms, but not 1 microgram, S(+)-ibuprofen also suppressed formalin-induced behavior, PGE2-LI, Glu, and Asp release. R(-)-ibuprofen showed no effect on formalin-induced behaviors or spinal release.

We considered that these dynorphin actions are mediated by a cascade involving the spinal release of excitatory amino acids and prostaglandins. Unanesthetized rats with lumbar intrathecal injection and loop dialysis probes received intrathecal NMDA, dynorphin A(1-17), or dynorphin A(2-17). These agents elicited an acute release of glutamate, aspartate, and taurine but not serine. The dynorphin peptides and NMDA also elicited a long-lasting spinal release of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin release evoked by dynorphin A(2-17) or NMDA was blocked by the NMDA antagonist amino-5-phosphonovalerate as well the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen. To identify the COX isozyme contributing to this release, SC 58236, a COX-2 inhibitor, was given and found to reduce prostaglandin E2 release evoked by either agent. Unexpectedly, the COX-1 inhibitor SC 58560 also reduced dynorphin A(2-17)-induced, but not NMDA-induced, release of prostaglandin E2. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which elevated levels of spinal dynorphin seen in pathological conditions may produce hyperalgesia through the release of excitatory amino acids and in part by the activation of a constitutive spinal COX-1 and -2 cascade.",2004,,"Koetzner L, Hua XY, Lai J, Porreca F, Yaksh T.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/24/6/1451.full.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Specific formulations of ibuprofen used', 'Details on measurement endpoints for glutamate and prostaglandin E2 release']","The study focuses on spinal dynorphin and its effects rather than ibuprofen's permeation or release characteristics.

Epidemiological studies suggest reduced AD risk associates with long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Whereas chronic ibuprofen suppressed inflammation and plaque-related pathology in an Alzheimer transgenic APPSw mouse model (Tg2576), excessive use of NSAIDs targeting cyclooxygenase I can cause gastrointestinal, liver, and renal toxicity. One alternative NSAID is curcumin, derived from the curry spice turmeric. Curcumin has an extensive history as a food additive and herbal medicine in India and is also a potent polyphenolic antioxidant. To evaluate whether it could affect Alzheimer-like pathology in the APPSw mice, we tested a low (160 ppm) and a high dose of dietary curcumin (5000 ppm) on inflammation, oxidative damage, and plaque pathology. Low and high doses of curcumin significantly lowered oxidized proteins and interleukin-1beta, a proinflammatory cytokine elevated in the brains of these mice. With low-dose but not high-dose curcumin treatment, the astrocytic marker GFAP was reduced, and insoluble beta-amyloid (Abeta), soluble Abeta, and plaque burden were significantly decreased by 43-50%. However, levels of amyloid precursor (APP) in the membrane fraction were not reduced. Microgliosis was also suppressed in neuronal layers but not adjacent to plaques.

Keratinocytes, which occupy much of the skin epidermis, are situated at the interface between the external environment and the body's internal milieu, and have long been appreciated for their barrier function against external insults. The recent discovery of temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) ion channels in keratinocytes has raised the possibility that these cells also actively participate in acute temperature and pain sensation. To address this notion, we generated and characterized transgenic mice that overexpress TRPV3 in epidermal keratinocytes under the control of the keratin 14 promoter. Compared with wild-type controls, keratinocytes overexpressing TRPV3 exhibited larger currents as well as augmented prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release in response to two TRPV3 agonists, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) and heat. Thermal selection behavior and heat-evoked withdrawal behavior of naive mice overexpressing TRPV3 were not consistently altered. Upon selective pharmacological inhibition of TRPV1 with JNJ-17203212 [corrected], however, the keratinocyte-specific TRPV3 transgenic mice showed increased escape responses to noxious heat relative to their wild-type littermates. Coadministration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, with the TRPV1 antagonist decreased inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia in transgenic but not wild-type animals.

By matching metabolome profiles, we predicted which small molecules targeted which signaling systems and recovered known interactions.

A previous analysis of colorectal tumors revealed that overexpression of splice variant Rac1b occurs in around 80% of tumors with mutant BRAF and both events proved to cooperate in tumor cell survival. Here, we provide evidence for increased expression of Rac1b in patients with inflamed human colonic mucosa as well as following experimentally induced colitis in mice. The increase of Rac1b in the mouse model was specifically prevented by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, which also inhibited Rac1b expression in cultured HT29 colorectal tumor cells through a cyclooxygenase inhibition.independent mechanism. Accordingly, the presence of ibuprofen led to a reduction of HT29 cell survival in vitro and inhibited Rac1b-dependent tumor growth of HT29 xenografts. Together, our results suggest that stromal cues, namely, inflammation, can trigger changes in Rac1b expression in the colon and identify ibuprofen as a highly specific and efficient inhibitor of Rac1b overexpression in colorectal tumors.

MED,21903019,21903019.0,10.18433/j3160b,A new vesicle-loaded hydrogel system suitable for topical applications: preparation and characterization.,"PURPOSE. Aim of this research was to prepare and study drug release from a new formulation consisting of non ionic surfactant vesicular structures, niosomes (NSVs), loaded with model molecules calcein (CALC), nile red (NR), ibuprofen (IBU) or caffeine (CAFF), and embedded in a hydrogel matrix. METHODS. The system locust bean gum/xanthan (1:1), prepared at 60 °C, was used to entrap the vesicles (Tween 20/cholesterol 1:1), loaded with guest molecules and the release profiles were detected at 32 °C. The hydrogel systems were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy; niosomes were characterized by means of size and -potential measurements. RESULTS. Size measurements showed that a slight increase in vesicle dimensions occurs after inclusion of CALC or CAFF (hydrophilic molecules) in the vesicular structures. -potential measurements showed that the inclusion of these molecules did not significantly modify the surface charge of empty vesicles. This was probably related to an almost negligible drug adsorption on the vesicle surface. The release from the niosomes-gel systems of two probes (CALC and NR) showed that the diffusion of CALC through the gel was not affected by the niosome entrapment while for NR, the presence of vesicles was crucial. The release profiles from niosomes-gel systems and from the hydrogel alone of model drugs, CAFF and IBU, showed an appreciable difference between the two drugs: the more hydrophilic CAFF was released much faster than IBU. In all release studies turbidity, dimension and -potential analyses indicated that the loaded niosomes were released by the hydrogel matrix without being damaged. CONCLUSIONS.

Firstly, cinnamon oil was extracted by steam distillation, then the compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the cinnamaldehyde content in cinnamon oil was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). With azone as positive control, ibuprofen as model drug, cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde as penetration enhancers (PE) were prepared and administered to the SD rat's abdominal skin. The penetration-enhancing effects of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde and their own transdermal absorption properties were compared. The results showed that yield of cinnamon oil was (3.55±0.36)% (<i>n</i>=3), and the cinnamaldehyde content in cinnamon oil was (73.48±0.21)% (<i>n</i>=3). As compared with blank group, the enhancing rate (ER) of cinnamon oil, cinnamaldehyde, and azone was 3.56, 1.13, 2.47 respectively.

Under the presence of 3 kinds of the primary bile salts such a sodium taurocholate, etc., or a secondary bile salt such a sodium taurochenodeoxycholate at 0.01 mmol/L concentration, a significant difference was not demonstrated in the permeation clearance of the ibuprofen entrapped O/W microemulsion, as compared with the case without the bile salts. Thus, the bile salts did not have a remarkable influence on the permeability of the drug entrapped in the O/W microemulsion, and it was verified that this O/W microemulsion was hardly influenced by the flow of the bile secretion. On the other hand, when N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) with the removal ability of a mucin layer was combined with the ibuprofen entrapped O/W microemulsion at the concentration of 3 and 10 mmol/L, it was shown that the permeation clearance of free ibuprofen did not decrease, but that of ibuprofen entrapped in the O/W microemulsion decreased with the increase of the NAC concentration. Therefore, it is confirmed that the mucin layer participates in the permeability of the drug entrapped in the O/W microemulsion.

However, inflammation may lead to life-threatening conditions. The most common treatment of inflammation is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nowadays, the development of safer new NSAIDs is critical as most of the existing NSAIDs have serious adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and cardiotoxicity. In the present study, four compounds as Schiff base derivatives of 7-hydroxy-4-formyl coumarin and 7-methoxy-4-formyl coumarin were designed and synthesized aiming to develop a lead compound that exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and circumvents the side effects of NSAIDs, especially GI toxicity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Lipinski's rule of five was applied for each designed molecule to evaluate the drug-likeness properties. Molecular docking studies were performed using the ligands and the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein to select the best-scored molecule using AutoDock 4.2.6. The molecules were then synthesized and characterized. An in vitro anti-inflammatory assay of the compounds against the COX-2 receptor was realized through a protein denaturation assay.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>All four synthesized ligands passed Lipinski's rule of five and exhibited higher binding free energy compared to the positive standard control (ibuprofen), and the <i>K</i>i values of compounds 5, 7, and 8 were in the nanomolar range. However, only compounds 6 and 7 obtained a higher percentage of inhibition of protein denaturation relative to ibuprofen.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present study suggested that compound 7 may be a lead molecule because this ligand not only exhibited the best computational and experimental results but also exhibited the strongest correlation between the concentration and percentage of protein denaturation (R = 0.986 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.972) with the lowest P-value (0.014).",2022,,"Hamid SJ, Salih T.",https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S364746,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,yes,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Details on in vitro studies', 'Specific methods used in protein denaturation assay', 'Comparison results with ibuprofen', 'Formulation details of synthesized compounds']","The study focuses on the synthesis and anti-inflammatory activity of new compounds, with ibuprofen as a comparison, but does not mention in vitro permeation or diffusion specifically.",0.6

However, due to the low selectivity of cancer cells, chemotherapy drugs produce a series of grievous side effects on normal cells.<h4>Methods</h4>In this research, we developed novel nanocarriers for magnetically targeted near-infrared (NIR) light-electromagnetic wave dual controlled drug delivery based on MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS nanoparticles (NPs) modified with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in response to magnetic, NIR light, and electromagnetic wave irradiation. Synthesis and characterization of MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS-APTES NPs was carried out using X-ray diffraction measurements, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence emission spectra, UV-1800 spectrophotometer, N5230A vector network analyzer, MDS-6 microwave sample preparation system, and superconducting quantum interference device. In addition to that mentioned above, we also explored many other sides, such as the drug-loading, drug-controlled release efficiency, elect99omagnetic wave thermal effect and photo-thermal effect.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that APTES-modified MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS NPs had 37% high drug-loading capacity and high electromagnetic wave thermal conversion ability and NIR-light thermal conversion ability. In addition, ibuprofen (IBU) release from the MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS-APTES-IBU depends on the electromagnetic wave (2.45 GHz) and 1060 nm NIR light irradiation. After five cycles, the drug-release percentage was 90% and 66% separately, and could be adjusted by the time and cycles times of electromagnetic wave and NIR light irritation. Electromagnetic wave irradiation compared with NIR light irradiation, has a higher drug release rate and better penetration. Therefore, choosing different stimulation methods according to the treatment needs of the disease, we can achieve accurate personalized treatment of the disease.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our findings indicate that multifunctional APTES modified MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS NPs could be used for the first time as a new drug carrier for ""location-timing-quantification"" drug release with magnetic targeting and dual control of NIR light-electromagnetic waves.",2020,,"Peng H, Wang M, Hu C, Guo J.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S267614,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,both,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology on drug release measurements', 'Specifics of the diffusion cell setup used', 'Comparative results for different barriers tested', 'Formulation details of the MgFe2O4@CuS-APTES-IBU']","The study discusses ibuprofen release using a novel nanocarrier and evaluates its drug release under specific irradiation conditions, making it highly relevant for permeation analysis.",0.9

A nanoemulsion is a transparent mixture of oil, surfactant and water with a very low viscosity, usually the product of its high water content. The present study investigated the modification of nanoemulsions with different hydrocolloid gums, to enhanced drug delivery of ibuprofen. The in vitro characterization of the initial and modified nanoemulsions was also studied.<h4>Methods</h4>A palm kernel oil esters nanoemulsion was modified with different hydrocolloid gums for the topical delivery of ibuprofen. Three different hydrocolloids (gellan gum, xanthan gum, and carrageenan) were selected for use. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed using palm kernel oil esters as the oil, Tween 80 as the surfactant, and water. Nanoemulsions were prepared by phase inversion composition, and were gradually mixed with the freshly prepared hydrocolloids. The initial nanoemulsion and modified nanoemulsions were characterized. The abilities of the nanoemulsions to deliver ibuprofen were assessed in vitro, using a Franz diffusion cell fitted with rat skin.<h4>Results</h4>No significant changes were observed in droplet size (~16-20 nm) but a significant difference in polydispersity indexes were observed before and after the modification of nanoemulsions using gellan gum, carrageenan, and xanthan gum. The zeta potentials of the initial nanoemulsions (-11.0 mV) increased to -19.6 mV, -13.9 mV, and -41.9 mV, respectively. The abilities of both the initial nanoemulsion (T802) and the modified nanoemulsion to deliver ibuprofen through the skin were evaluated in vitro, using Franz diffusion cells fitted with rat skin. The in vitro permeation data showed that the modified nanoemulsion (Kp value of 55.4 × 10(-3) cm · h(-1)) increased the permeability of ibuprofen 4.40 times over T802 (Kp value of 12.6 × 10(-3) cm · h(-1)) (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The modified nanoemulsion may be a promising vehicle to enhance the permeation of ibuprofen for topical delivery.",2012,,"Salim N, Basri M, Rahman MB, Abdullah DK, Basri H.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S34700,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed methodology of nanoemulsion preparation', 'In vitro permeation data breakdown', 'Characterization results of different hydrocolloid gums', 'Statistical analysis of permeability results']","The study involves in vitro permeation of ibuprofen using a Franz diffusion cell, with measurable endpoints related to drug delivery efficiency.

Recently, we demonstrated the antiproliferative effects of ibuprofen on the human gastric cancer cell line MKN-45. However, high doses of ibuprofen were required to elicit these antiproliferative effects in vitro. The present research compared the antiproliferative effects of ibuprofen delivered freely and released by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) in MKN-45 cells.<h4>Methods</h4>MKN-45 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells were treated with ibuprofen-loaded PLGA NPs. The proliferation of MKN-45 cells was then assessed by cell counting. The uptake of NPs was imaged by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The release of ibuprofen from ibuprofen-loaded PLGA NPs in the cells was evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.<h4>Results</h4>Dramatic inhibition of cellular proliferation was observed in cells treated with ibuprofen-loaded PLGA NPs versus those treated with free ibuprofen at the same concentration. The localization of NPs was cytoplasmic. The initiation of ibuprofen release was rapid, commencing within 2 hours, and then increased slowly over time, reaching a maximum concentration at 24 hours. The inhibition of proliferation was confirmed to be due to the intracellular release of ibuprofen from the NPs. Using PLGA NPs as carriers, ibuprofen exerted an antiproliferative activity at concentrations > 100 times less than free ibuprofen, suggesting greater efficiency and less cellular toxicity. In addition, when carried by PLGA NPs, ibuprofen more quickly induced the expression of transcripts involved in proliferation and invasiveness processes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ibuprofen exerted an antiproliferative effect on MKN-45 cells at low concentrations. This effect was achieved using PLGA NPs as carriers of low doses of ibuprofen.",2012,,"Bonelli P, Tuccillo FM, Federico A, Napolitano M, Borrelli A, Melisi D, Rimoli MG, Palaia R, Arra C, Carinci F.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S34723,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation in PLGA NPs', 'Specific methods of ibuprofen release measurement', 'Impact of ibuprofen release on permeation characteristics', 'Comparison of permeation with and without NPs']","The study focuses on the cellular effects of ibuprofen delivered via PLGA nanoparticles, which may not directly relate to in vitro permeation/release studies relevant for the dataset.",0.7

Recurrent wound infections and prolonged treatment impose significant economic and psychological burdens, drastically reducing patients' quality of life. Modulating the inflammatory response is a promising strategy to accelerate diabetic wound healing. Ibuprofen (IBU), a widely used anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent, has the potential to promote healing by mitigating excessive inflammation and alleviating wound-associated pain. However, its clinical application is hindered by poor water solubility and a short half-life. Therefore, a controlled and sustained-release system for IBU could enhance its therapeutic efficacy in diabetic wound management.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Here, we present an in situ multi-crosslinked composite hydrogel system that integrates oxidized alginate (OSA), methacryloylated gelatin (GelMA), and an ibuprofen/amino-modified β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (IBU/CD-NH<sub>2</sub>) via ion crosslinking, photocrosslinking, and Schiff-base reactions.<h4>Results</h4>The optimized hydrogel formulation was synthesized at 35°C, with a P/A molar ratio of 2 and an methacrylamide(MA) volume fraction of 20%. Physicochemical and biocompatibility analyses demonstrated that the IBU-loaded composite hydrogel exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, favorable biocompatibility, tunable degradation, and injectability. This system effectively addresses IBU's solubility and absorption challenges while conforming to wounds of varying shapes and sizes, enabling controlled and sustained drug release. Cellular and animal studies confirmed that the hydrogel continuously and uniformly releases IBU, exerting anti-inflammatory effects while promoting angiogenesis and fibroblast migration. This leads to enhanced granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and epidermal regeneration, significantly accelerating wound closure within 14 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By simultaneously suppressing inflammation and stimulating tissue regeneration through controlled IBU release, this hydrogel system offers a highly effective strategy for diabetic wound healing and holds strong potential for clinical application.",2025,,"Li Z, Dong H, Yang S, Wang X, Li Z.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S504924,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Specifics on the in vitro diffusion study setup', 'Details on the Franz diffusion cell methodology', 'Quantitative data on ibuprofen release rates', 'Comparative analysis of drug release profiles', 'Characterization of hydrogel properties and their impact on permeation']","The abstract indicates the development of a controlled-release ibuprofen formulation and mentions its release characteristics, which aligns with in vitro permeation studies.

Screening and molecular docking of ibuprofen as a therapeutic target. The effectiveness of ibuprofen was verified by constructing a PD model in vitro, and constructing ""COVID19-PD"" signaling pathway, and exploring the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in PD.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 13 DEG were screened from the GSE36980 and GSE5281 datasets. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the DEG were mainly associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, etc. After analysis, it is found that ibuprofen alleviates PD symptoms by inhibiting the expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Based on signal pathway construction, the importance of ACE2 in COVID-19-induced PD has been identified. ACE2 is found to have widespread distribution in the brain. In the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-te-trahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced <i>ACE2</i>-null PD mice model, more severe motor and non-motor symptoms, increased NF-κB p65 and α-synuclein (α-syn) expression with significant aggregation, decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), severe neuronal loss, and neurodegenerative disorders.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases the risk of PD through an inflammatory environment and downregulation of ACE2, providing evidence for the molecular mechanism and targeted therapy associated with COVID-19 and PD.",2024,,"Liu T, Wu H, Sun L, Wei J.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=99291,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'In vitro experimental methods', 'Endpoints measured in PD model', 'Diffusion cell usage related to ibuprofen']","While the study includes ibuprofen, it primarily focuses on its effects in a PD model and does not provide direct information on ibuprofen permeation using Franz cells.

Most commercially available topical NSAID formulations are clinically effective, but direct comparisons of anti-inflammatory activity including both skin absorption and inhibitory potency are lacking. This study examined the skin absorption of representative commercially available topical diclofenac- and ibuprofen-based formulations along with published potency values to determine formulations with superior anti-inflammatory activity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Cumulative absorption and flux profiles of 12 commercially available topical NSAIDs (6 diclofenac-based and 6 ibuprofen-based) were evaluated in vitro using human skin in static Franz diffusion cells. Each formulation was applied as a single dose. In vitro permeation parameters and published COX-2 inhibition values were used to calculate a modified index of topical anti-inflammatory activity (mITAA).<h4>Results</h4>All diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations permeated human skin in vitro. The rate and degree of absorption differed between diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations and between formulations of the same drug. NSAID concentration within a product was not solely responsible for the permeation flux or degree of absorption. Ibuprofen formulations permeated the skin more rapidly and to a greater degree than diclofenac, but calculated mITAAs were higher for diclofenac.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Diclofenac exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity as measured by the index. Differences beyond drug concentration, including excipients, drug salt form, and dosage form, contribute to differences in absorption and thus in anti-inflammatory activity. Both absorption and COX-2 inhibition potency are important for anti-inflammatory activity, but their priority depends upon the products being compared-with the same NSAID, absorption determines superiority; with different NSAIDs, superiority is determined by the balance between absorption and COX-2 potency. These findings should be considered when selecting a topical NSAID for treating patient pain and inflammation.",2020,,Pradal J.,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=63364,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on formulations used', 'Specific in vitro measurement techniques', 'Data on permeation rates and flux', 'COX-2 inhibition results', 'Comparison of results between formulations']",The study directly involves in vitro permeation using Franz diffusion cells to evaluate ibuprofen formulations.

In the study reported here, we tested the efficacy of celecoxib, diclofenac, and ibuprofen on preprotachykinin mRNA synthesis, substance P (SP) release, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release, and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCɛ) translocation in rat cultured sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). The efficacy of these NSAIDs was compared with the efficacy of paracetamol and nimesulide in in vitro models of hyperalgesia (investigated previously). While nimesulide and paracetamol, as in previous experiments, decreased the percentage of cultured DRG neurons showing translocation of PKCɛ caused by 100 nM thrombin or 1 μM bradykinin in a dose-dependent manner, the other NSAIDs tested did not have a significant effect. The amount of SP released by peptidergic neurons and the expression level of preprotachykinin mRNA were assessed in basal conditions and after 70 minutes or 36 hours of stimulation with an inflammatory soup (IS) containing potassium chloride, thrombin, bradykinin, and endothelin-1. The release of SP at 70 minutes was inhibited only by nimesulide, while celecoxib and diclofenac were effective at 36 hours. The mRNA basal level of the SP precursor preprotachykinin expressed in DRG neurons was reduced only by nimesulide, while the increased levels expressed during treatment with the IS were significantly reduced by all drugs tested, with the exception of ibuprofen.

We proposed ""Invigorating Qi and activating Blood"" (IQAB) acupuncture, compared with Fenbid, and local electroacupuncture (LEA), to observe whether it has advantages in the protection of the CSR rat model and to elucidate its mechanism through the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, sham, model, Fenbid, LEA, and IQAB. The CSR model was induced by inserting nylon sutures to compress the C<sub>4</sub>-T<sub>1</sub> nerve root. The Fenbid group was treated with ibuprofen sustained-release capsules (15 mg/kg·d, <i>ig</i>). The LEA group received electroacupuncture at both C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>7</sub> EX-B2 once a day. The IQAB group received acupuncture at both ST36 and BL17 based on the LEA group's intervention.

IQAB significantly alleviated these changes, and the effects were generally comparable to those of Fenbid. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation ratios of p38 and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), co-expression of p-p38 with neuron/microglia, and MCP-1 levels in the spinal cord were markedly down-regulated by IQAB compared with those in CSR model rats.<h4>Conclusion</h4>IQAB reduced p38-activation-related microglia activation and MCP-1 levels, thus alleviating pathological changes, inflammation levels in the local spinal cord, and pain behavior of CSR.",2023,,"Shi T, Liu Y, Ji B, Wang J, Ge Y, Fang Y, Xie Y, Xiao H, Wu L, Wang Y.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=94480,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Formulation details of ibuprofen', 'Method of measuring ibuprofen release', 'Comparison data between Fenbid and acupuncture effects']","The study primarily focuses on acupuncture effects in a rat model and includes ibuprofen as a treatment, but does not address in vitro permeation or diffusion cells.

Significant improvement is usually achieved by surgery. However, postoperative pain can be moderate to severe for 2-3 days. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of transdermal fentanyl for postoperative pain management after forefoot surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty patients undergoing hallux valgus or hallux rigidus surgery were allocated to receive a patch delivering either fentanyl 12 μg/hour or placebo for postoperative pain. The consumption of rescue opioid oxycodone, the primary outcome measure, was evaluated daily until the fourth postoperative day.

Few studies have been conducted in other patient populations. A 4-week prospective multicenter open-label observational study was designed to explore and describe the combined effect of ibuprofen SR and standard medical care in patients suffering from osteoarthritis in 15 general medical practices in Egypt.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>In total, 519 patients were prescribed ibuprofen SR 2 ×800 mg once daily for 4 weeks.<h4>Results</h4>Ibuprofen SR combined with standard medical care significantly improved day and night pain, with 99.4% of the patients reporting improvement. The treatment reduced the symptom severity of joint tenderness/stiffness and the duration of morning stiffness, and allowed more patients to carry out normal activities. Overall compliance with the prescribed ibuprofen SR regimen was 98.6%. Ibuprofen SR was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported during the study.

In this context the removal efficiencies of sewage treatment plants (STPs) are of importance, as their effluents are important point sources for the release of those substances into the aquatic environment. Activated sludge based wastewater treatment is the worldwide prevalently used treatment technique. In conventional plants the separation of treated wastewater and sludge occurs via sedimentation. A new development is the application of membrane technology for this separation step. The studies focus on the influence of the solids retention time (SRT) on the removal efficiency, as the SRT is the most important parameter in the design of STPs. A conventional activated sludge plant (CASP) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR) were operated at different SRTs. The substances selected are the antiepileptic carbamazepine, the analgesics diclofenac and ibuprofen, the lipid regulator bezafibrate, the polycyclic musks tonalide and galaxolide and the contraceptive 17alpha-ethinylestradiole.

Three membrane methods (micro-, ultra-, and nano-filtration), and two advanced oxidations (gamma radiation and electrochemical oxidation) were applied. Best results concerning the removal of pharmaceuticals and hormones from urine by membrane separation were achieved using the membrane NF-200 (FilmTec). Pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen and diclofenac), and hormones (oestrone, beta-oestradiol, ethenyloestradiol, oestriol) were removed completely from urine. NF-separation also has some disadvantages: losses of urea, and lowering the conductivity in the product (permeate). The retentates (concentrates) received have to be treated further by oxidation to destroy the ""problem"" compounds. The results showed that electrochemical oxidation is more suitable than gamma radiation. Gamma-radiation with intensities higher than 10 kGy has to be applied for efficiently destroying of ibuprofen, and especially diclofenac. A high quantity of intermediate ""problem"" substances with oestrone structure was formed during the gamma oxidation of hormone containing urine samples.

A search of MEDLINE was conducted and articles published in English until December 2003 were included. The results from in vitro and animal experiments as well as from human clinical trials are presented. Non-selective cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors used in periodontal research include compounds such as aspirin, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen and piroxicam. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors represent a new group of pharmaceutical products termed ""coxibs"" that include meloxicam, nimesulide, etodolac and celecoxib. Evidence from animal experiments and clinical trials documents that selective and non-selective NSAIDs are mainly responsible for the stabilization of periodontal conditions by reducing the rate of alveolar bone resorption. This is achieved through local inhibition of both enzymes (e.g. COX-1 and COX-2) responsible for the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites. Evidence shows that the effects of NSAIDs drop off rapidly after drug withdrawal. One of the major advantages of selective COX-2 inhibition is the reduction of adverse systemic effects. Although some studies present promising results, no data from long-term, multicenter prospective clinical trials are yet available for determining whether these therapeutic effects can be retained on a long-term basis. Many of these compounds, such as flurbiprofen, are readily absorbed through the gingival tissues. Therefore, the development of topical NSAIDs formulations (e.g. gels, toothpastes, rinses) with a daily application seems to be of particular interest. This may help to further reduce adverse systemic effects of non-selective NSAIDs in the long-term host modulation of periodontitis-susceptible patients.",2005,,"Salvi GE, Lang NP.",https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612053764878,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,skin,"['Specific formulation details for ibuprofen', 'In vitro permeation data', 'Experimental methods related to diffusion cells', 'Comparative analysis of NSAIDs effects on periodontal treatment']","The study discusses NSAIDs and their effects on periodontal conditions, but details on ibuprofen’s permeation through diffusion cells are not provided.

The cyclooxygenase inhibitors, Na-salicylate and Na-acetylsalicylate, potentiated glucose-induced insulin release, despite a decrease in Ca influx evidenced by inhibition of the Ca-dependent electrical activity in beta-cells and 45Ca efflux from islets perifused with a medium containing Ca. This paradox can probably be explained by a mobilization of intracellular Ca (acceleration of 45Ca efflux in the absence of Ca) with subsequent activation of K+ channels (acceleration of 86Rb efflux) and repolarization of the membrane. These effects of salicylate could not be ascribed to a change in intracellular pH because they were not mimicked by 2-Cl-benzoate, which has a similar pK as salicylate but increased insulin release by stimulating Ca influx in beta-cells. Among the other cyclooxygenase inhibitors tested, indomethacin caused a slight potentiation of insulin release accompanied by marginal increases in 45Ca efflux and electrical activity, whereas flurbiprofen and ibuprofen were ineffective.

Additionally, many attempts have been made to tune hydrophobic/hydrophilic drug release kinetics over time, avoiding the so-called <i>burst release</i>. In this scenario, hydrogels resulting from the assembly of micellar structures showing a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell could represent a promising alternative to design versatile drug vehicles. In this regard, this work aimed at designing new thermosensitive micellar hydrogels starting from a custom-made amphiphilic poly(ether urethane) (PEU). Specifically, a commercial triblock copolymer (Poloxamer<sup>®</sup> 407), selected to ensure the temperature-driven chain arrangement into micelles, was reacted with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. The successful PEU synthesis was proved by size-exclusion chromatography ( M ¯ <sub><i>w</i></sub> 50000 Da) and infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, the wettability-driven drug arrangement within the micelle network as well as the influence of drug-loading on the resultant formulation thermosensitivity was investigated by selecting ibuprofen (IBU) and ibuprofen sodium salt (IBUSS) as hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, respectively. Specifically, growing drug amounts were loaded into PEU solutions, and the average hydrodynamic micelle diameters and the critical micellar temperatures (CMT) were measured. Systems containing IBU at the highest tested concentration (i.e., 20 mg/mL) showed a significantly higher micelle average diameter (58.2 ± 4.7 nm) and a remarkably lower CMT (8.9°C) with respect to both the control (40.1 ± 1.4 nm and 21.6°C) and IBUSS-loaded formulations (37.3 ± 2.1 nm and 22.4°C). Then, the influence of drug encapsulation on the temperature at which micelles begin to aggregate was rheologically assessed, showing that IBU-loading induced a decrease in this parameter (14.6, 8.7, and 13.7°C for virgin, IBU-loaded, and IBUSS-loaded hydrogel, respectively). Finally, IBU and IBUSS releasing mechanism was analysed using the Korsmayer-Peppas model (<i>n</i> value of 0.63 ± 0.007 and 0.89 ± 0.003 for IBU- and IBUSS-loaded gels, respectively).

But, it is also produced from plants and microorganisms. The natural occurrence of styrene led to several microbiological strategies to form and also to degrade styrene. One pathway designated as side-chain oxygenation has been reported as a specific route for the styrene degradation among microorganisms. It comprises the following enzymes: styrene monooxygenase (SMO; NADH-consuming and FAD-dependent, two-component system), styrene oxide isomerase (SOI; cofactor independent, membrane-bound protein) and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PAD; NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming) and allows an intrinsic cofactor regeneration. This specific way harbors a high potential for biotechnological use. Based on the enzymatic steps involved in this degradation route, important reactions can be realized from a large number of substrates which gain access to different interesting precursors for further applications. Furthermore, stereochemical transformations are possible, offering chiral products at high enantiomeric excess. This review provides an actual view on the microbiological styrene degradation followed by a detailed discussion on the enzymes of the side-chain oxygenation. Furthermore, the potential of the single enzyme reactions as well as the respective multi-step syntheses using the complete enzyme cascade are discussed in order to gain styrene oxides, phenylacetaldehydes, or phenylacetic acids (e.g., ibuprofen). Altered routes combining these putative biocatalysts with other enzymes are additionally described. Thus, the substrates spectrum can be enhanced and additional products as phenylethanols or phenylethylamines are reachable. Finally, additional enzymes with similar activities toward styrene and its metabolic intermediates are shown in order to modify the cascade described above or to use these enzyme independently for biotechnological application.",2018,,"Oelschlägel M, Zimmerling J, Tischler D.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00490,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,yes,uncertain,uncertain,no,uncertain,"['Specific methods of permeation study', 'Formulation details about ibuprofen', 'Endpoints measured', 'Relevance to Franz diffusion cells']","The abstract discusses styrene degradation mechanisms and enzymes, with a tangential mention of ibuprofen as a product, but lacks focus on in vitro permeation studies.",0.6

To address this, understanding the effects of NSAIDs on bacteria is crucial for bioremediation efforts in pharmaceutical-contaminated environments. The primary challenge in breaking down persistent compounds lies not in the biochemical pathways but in capacity of bacteria to surmount stressors.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we examined the biodegradative activity, morphological and physiological changes, and ultrastructural adaptations of <i>Rhodococcus cerastii</i> strain IEGM 1243 when exposed to ibuprofen, diclofenac, and their mixture.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Our findings revealed that <i>R. cerastii</i> IEGM 1243 exhibited moderate biodegradative activity towards the tested NSAIDs. Cellular respiration assay showed higher metabolic activity in the presence of NSAIDs, indicating their influence on bacterial metabolism. Furthermore, catalase activity in <i>R. cerastii</i> IEGM 1243 exposed to NSAIDs showed an initial decrease followed by fluctuations, with the most significant changes observed in the presence of DCF and the NSAID mixture, likely influenced by bacterial growth phases, active NSAID degradation, and the formation of multicellular aggregates, suggesting potential intercellular synergy and task distribution within the bacterial community. Morphometric analysis demonstrated alterations in size, shape, and surface roughness of cells exposed to NSAIDs, with a decrease in surface area and volume, and an increase in surface area-to-volume ratio (SA/V). Moreover, for the first time, transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of lipid inclusions, polyphosphates, and intracellular membrane-like structures in the ibuprofen-treated cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results provide valuable insights into the adaptive responses of <i>R. cerastii</i> IEGM 1243 to NSAIDs, shedding light on the possible interaction between bacteria and pharmaceutical compounds in the environment.",2023,,"Tyumina E, Bazhutin G, Kostrikina N, Sorokin V, Mulyukin A, Ivshina I.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1275553,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,yes,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific analytical methods used', 'Endpoints measured during the study']","The study examines bacterial adaptations to ibuprofen but does not focus on in vitro permeation or release, making it less relevant for the dataset.",0.4

Inflammation is associated with increasing cancer incidence. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that NSAID treatment could cause an anti-tumor effect in cancers. In the present study, blood was taken from healthy individuals (<i>n</i> = 17) and patients with respiratory diseases or lung cancer (<i>n</i> = 36). White blood cells (WBC) were treated with either a micro-suspension, i.e., bulk (B) or nano-suspension (N) of aspirin (ASP) or ibuprofen (IBU) up to 500 μg/ml in the comet assay and up to 125 μg/ml in the micronucleus assay. In this study results were compared against untreated lymphocytes and their corresponding treated groups. The results showed, that NSAIDs in their nano form significantly reduced the DNA damage in WBCs from lung cancer patients in bulk and nano compared to untreated lymphocytes. Also, there was a decrease in the level of DNA damage in the comet assay after treating WBCs from healthy individuals, asthma and COPD groups with aspirin N (ASP N) but not with IBU N. In addition, the number of micronuclei decreased after treatment with NSAIDs in their nano form (ASP N and IBU N) in the healthy as well as in the lung cancer group.

The dipeptide is distributed unevenly over the brain but the majority is concentrated in the cerebral cortex. The putative KTP receptor has not been identified yet. As many other neuropeptides, KTP clearance is mediated by extracellular peptidases and peptide transporters. From the wide spectrum of biological activity of KTP, analgesia was by far the most studied. The mechanism of action is still unclear, but researchers agree that KTP induces Met-enkephalins release. More recently, KTP was proposed as biomarker of Alzheimer disease. Despite all that, KTP limited pharmacological value prompted researchers to develop derivatives more lipophilic and therefore more prone to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and also more resistant to enzymatic degradation. Conjugation of KTP with functional molecules, such as ibuprofen, generated a new class of compounds with additional biological properties.

Hearing loss can be the result of intense or prolonged noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, infections, and trauma, which trigger inflammatory signaling cascades that lead to irreversible damage to cochlear structures. To address this, we developed and characterized a series of covalent conjugates of anti-inflammatory drugs to hyaluronic acid (HA), for potential use as topical ototherapeutics. These conjugates were tested in <i>in vitro</i> assays designed to mirror physiological processes typically observed with acoustic trauma. Intense noise exposure leads to macrophage recruitment to the cochlea and subsequent inflammatory damage to sensory cells. We therefore first tested our conjugates' ability to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. This anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages also translated to increased cochlear cell viability. In our initial screening, one conjugate, ibuprofen-HA, demonstrated significantly higher anti-inflammatory potential than its counterparts. Subsequent cytokine release profiling of ibuprofen-HA further confirmed its ability to reduce a wider range of inflammatory markers, to a greater extent than its equivalent unconjugated drug. The conjugate's potential as a topical therapeutic was then assessed in previously developed tympanic and round window membrane tissue permeation models. As expected, our data indicate that the conjugate has limited tympanic membrane model permeability; however, it readily permeated the round window membrane model and to a greater extent than the unconjugated drug. Interestingly, our data also revealed that ibuprofen-HA was well tolerated in cellular and tissue cytocompatibility assays, whereas the unconjugated drug displayed significant cytotoxicity at equivalent concentrations. Moreover, our data highlighted the importance of chemical conjugation of ibuprofen to HA; the conjugate had improved anti-inflammatory effects, significantly reduced cytotoxicity, and is more suitable for therapeutic formulation. Overall, this work suggests that ibuprofen-HA could be a promising safe and effective topical ototherapeutic for inflammation-mediated cochlear damage.",2024,,"Birru B, Veit JGS, Arrigali EM, Van Tine J, Barrett-Catton E, Tonnerre Z, Diaz P, Serban MA.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1355283/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVPT,yes,yes,both,"['specific permeability data for ibuprofen-HA', 'comparison with unconjugated ibuprofen', 'mechanism of action of HA conjugation', 'details on the in vitro models used']",The study develops a novel ibuprofen conjugate and tests its effectiveness in permeability models; relevant for IVPT data.,0.9

Thus, developing a dual inhibitor that targets both could be more effective as an anticancer agent than single inhibitors. We have previously shown that an analog of the bezafibrate named AA520 is a PPARα antagonist. Herein, we report the identification of AA520 as a potent COX-2 inhibitor using <i>in silico</i> approaches. In addition, we performed a thorough pharmacological characterization of AA520 towards COX-1 and COX-2 in different <i>in vitro</i> models.<h4>Methods</h4>AA520 was characterized for inhibiting platelet COX-1 and monocyte COX-2 activity in human whole blood (HWB) and for effects on lipidomics of eicosanoids using LC-MS/MS. The kinetics of the interaction of AA520 with COX-2 was assessed in the human colon cancer cell line, HCA-7, expressing only COX-2, by testing the COX-2 activity after extensive washing of the cells. The impact of AA520 on cancer cell viability, metabolic activity, and cytotoxicity was tested using the MTT reagent.<h4>Results</h4>In HWB, AA520 inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion LPS-stimulated leukocyte prostaglandin (PG) E<sub>2</sub> generation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05-0.263) μM while platelet COX-1 was not affected up to 300 μM. AA520 did not affect LPS-induced monocyte COX-2 expression, and other eicosanoids generated by enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. AA520 inhibited COX-2-dependent PGE<sub>2</sub> generation in the colon cancer cell line HCA7. Comparison of the inhibition of COX-2 and its reversibility by AA520, indomethacin (a time-dependent inhibitor), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (an irreversible inhibitor), and ibuprofen (a reversible inhibitor) showed that the compound is acting by forming a tightly bound COX-2 interaction. This was confirmed by docking and molecular dynamics studies. Moreover, AA520 (1 μM) significantly reduced MTT in HCA7 cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We have identified a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor with a unique scaffold.

The cause-effect relationship for these events remains unclear. We investigated the inflammatory role of ROS-sensitive AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in IH-induced airway hypersensitivity mediated by lung vagal C fibers (LVCFs) in rats. Conscious rats were exposed to room air (RA) or IH with or without treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, an antioxidant), Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), ibuprofen (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), or their vehicles. Immediately after exposure (24 h), we found that intravenous capsaicin, phenylbiguanide, or α,β-methylene-ATP evoked augmented LVCF-mediated apneic responses and LVCF afferent responses in rats subjected to IH exposure in comparison with those in RA rats. The potentiating effect of IH on LVCF responses decreased at 6 h after and vanished at 12 h after the termination of IH exposure. The potentiating effect of IH on LVCF-mediated apneic and LVCF afferent responses was significantly attenuated by treatment with NAC, compound C, or ibuprofen, but not by their vehicles. Further biochemical analysis revealed that rats exposed to IH displayed increased lung levels of lipid peroxidation (an index of oxidative stress), AMPK phosphorylation (an index of AMPK activation), and prostaglandin E2 (a cyclooxygenase metabolite), compared with those exposed to RA. IH-induced increase in lipid peroxidation was considerably suppressed by treatment with NAC but not by compound C or ibuprofen. IH-induced increase in AMPK phosphorylation was totally abolished by NAC or compound C but not by ibuprofen. IH-induced increase in prostaglandin E2 was considerably prevented by any of these three inhibitor treatments. The vehicles of these inhibitors exerted no significant effect on the three IH-induced responses. These results suggest that 24-h IH exposure sensitizes LVCFs, leading to an exaggerated reflex and afferent responses to chemical stimulants in rats. Moreover, this IH-induced LVCF sensitization is mediated through a cascade of inflammatory responses in the airways involving increases in ROS, AMPK activation, and cyclooxygenase metabolite release.",2016,,"Yang CH, Shen YJ, Lai CJ, Kou YR.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00263/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology on ibuprofen usage', 'Endpoints measured related to ibuprofen', 'Formulation details of ibuprofen used']",The study investigates the role of ibuprofen in a model unrelated to ibuprofen permeation or release but involves biological responses that may be relevant for pharmacological effects in the context of respiratory health.,0.6

The incidence and activity of IBD are determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Among these factors, polymorphisms in genes related to autophagy and the consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been consistently associated with IBD. We show that NSAIDs induce mitochondrial stress and mitophagy in intestinal epithelial cells. In an altered mitophagy context simulating that observed in IBD patients, NSAID-induced mitochondrial stress leads to the release of mitochondrial components, which act as Danger Associated Molecular Patterns with pro-inflammatory potential. Furthermore, colonic organoids from Crohn's disease patients and healthy donors show activation of the mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) upon treatment with ibuprofen. Finally, colon biopsies from Crohn's disease patients in remission or with low-to-moderate activity also show expression of genes involved in UPR<sup>mt</sup>, while patients with severe activity show no increase compared to healthy donors.

Perturbations of the intestinal epithelium or supporting factors can lead to the development of intestinal hyperpermeability, termed ""leaky gut"". A leaky gut is characterized by loss of epithelial integrity and reduced function of the gut barrier, and is associated with prolonged use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatories. The harmful effect of NSAIDs on intestinal and gastric epithelial integrity is considered an adverse effect that is common to all drugs belonging to this class, and it is strictly dependent on NSAID properties to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase enzymes. However, different factors may affect the specific tolerability profile of different members of the same class. The present study aims to compare the effects of distinct classes of NSAIDs, such as ketoprofen (K), Ibuprofen (IBU), and their corresponding lysine (Lys) and, only for ibuprofen, arginine (Arg) salts, using an in vitro model of leaky gut. The results obtained showed inflammatory-induced oxidative stress responses, and related overloads of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) accompanied by protein oxidation and morphological changes to the intestinal barrier, many of these effects being counteracted by ketoprofen and ketoprofen lysin salt.

FDE typically presents as localized spots or plaques without systemic symptoms; however, it can manifest in other forms, such as blisters and papules. In FDE, effector memory CD8-positive T cells that remain dormant in the basal layer after a previous inflammation are reactivated upon re-exposure to the causative drug, leading to the development of erythema at the same sites. <b>Case Presentation:</b> Herein, we report the case of a 23-year-old man who developed ibuprofen-induced multiple FDE. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting a rash immediately following ibuprofen administration, and histopathological findings were consistent with FDE. Ibuprofen is widely available as an over-the-counter medication, and patients may not always report its use-making the diagnosis of ibuprofen-induced FDE particularly challenging. Approximately 24 h following drug-induced CD8-positive T cell activation, regulatory T cells normally infiltrate the epidermis to suppress inflammation and promote resolution. However, in multiple FDE, CD8-positive T cell activity may outweigh that of regulatory T cells, causing uncontrolled inflammation and leading to the spread of poorly-demarcated lesions that can progress to severe drug reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). We reviewed 13 cases of ibuprofen-induced multiple FDE. <b>Conclusions:</b> Over-the-counter medications can cause multiple FDEs, and the repeated administration of the causative drug can result in severe reactions such as SJS/TEN. The early diagnosis and strict discontinuation of the causative drugs are therefore crucial.",2024,,"Mima Y, Yamamoto M, Obikane H, Norimatsu Y, Iozumi K.",https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics15010048,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Relevance to ibuprofen permeation', 'Methodology details regarding in vitro studies', 'Formulation specifics', 'Endpoints measured']",This article discusses a case report of drug reaction and does not focus on in vitro permeation studies.

The approach presented here is centered around the development of a prototypic synthetic glycerogel scaffold for bone regeneration, which simultaneously features therapeutic activity. The main novelty of this work lies in the combination of an open meso and macroporous nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC)-based glycerogel with a fully biocompatible microporous bioMOF system (CaSyr-1) composed of calcium ions and syringic acid. The bioMOF framework is further impregnated with a third bioactive component, i.e., ibuprofen (ibu), to generate a multifold bioactive system. The integrated CaSyr-1(ibu) serves as a reservoir for bioactive compounds delivery, while the NCC scaffold is the proposed matrix for cell ingrowth, proliferation and differentiation. The measured drug delivery profiles, studied in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 310 K, indicate that the bioactive components are released concurrently with bioMOF dissolution after ca. 30 min following a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Furthermore, according to the semi-empirical Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model, this release is governed by a case-II mechanism, suggesting that the molecular transport is influenced by the relaxation of the NCC matrix. Preliminary in vitro results denote that the initial high concentration of glycerol in the NCC scaffold can be toxic in direct contact with human osteoblasts (HObs).

Among them, cellulose is a great option for this challenging application due to its increased water retention capacity, mechanical strength, versatility and unlimited availability. Since algae are an unexploited source of cellulose, the novelty of this study is the decellularization of two different species, freshly collected from the Black Sea coast, using two different chemical surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulphate and Triton X-100), and characterisation of the resulted complex biopolymeric 3D matrices. The algae nature and decellularization agent significantly influenced the matrices porosity, while the values obtained for the hydration degree included them in hydrogel class. Moreover, their capacity to retain and then controllably release an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, led us to recommend the obtained structures as drug delivery systems.

The purpose of this study was to compare the release and permeation ability of two commonly used permeation enhancers-diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGME) and oleyl alcohol-by the changes in oil composition, the addition of a gelling agent, and water content using ibuprofen as a model drug. Four microemulsions were formulated, selection was based on ternary phase diagrams, and physicochemical properties were evaluated. The release and permeation of the microemulsion formulations were performed in vitro by Franz cell studies on a regenerated cellulose membrane and a Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane, respectively, and the amount of ibuprofen permeated and released was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All four microemulsions were compatible with the skin pH, and the average pH ranged from 4.9 to 5.6. The average droplet size of the microemulsions ranged from 119.8 to 153.3 nm. Drug release was significantly the highest from the gel-based microemulsions (59% and 64%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). However, there was a fourfold difference in drug permeation from these gels-a significantly higher permeation from the microemulsion-gel containing oleic acid and oleyl alcohol compared to the DGME formulation. These results indicated that the microemulsion-gel with oleyl alcohol as the permeation enhancer could be a preferable formulation approach for the topical administration of ibuprofen.

Gel-like dispersions were created by blending either gel or powder NCC (gNCC or pNCC) with natural polymers (alginate, pectin, or chitosan) in water, with glycerol serving as a plasticiser. Ibuprofen (IBU) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was dissolved in a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) to improve its solubility prior to its addition to gel-like dispersions. Dispersions were dried, and resulting films were cut to 3 cm × 1.5 cm size, appropriate for buccal delivery. Rheological measurements revealed that shorter, thinner, and less crystalline nanocellulose fibres are more favourable for stronger gel properties. While overall, weaker gel structure prior to film casting also resulted in shorter disintegration time, this was not the case for NCC-chitosan films; here, the low solubility of chitosan in neutral media proved to be the main obstacle. Nevertheless, the prolonged disintegration of NCC-chitosan films did not impact the dissolution of IBU, as these films exhibited the fastest dissolution rate, followed by NCC-pectin and NCC-alginate. Furthermore, NCC properties significantly influenced the dissolution behaviour of the chitosan formulations, with gNCC favouring faster IBU release due to weaker gel formation prior to film casting.",2025,,"Bolko Seljak K, Grilc B, Gašperlin M, Gosenca Matjaž M.",https://doi.org/10.3390/gels11030163,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on diffusion cell methodology', 'Quantitative data on ibuprofen permeability', 'Comparison with Franz diffusion cell results']","The study focuses on buccal films and not on traditional Franz diffusion setups, making it less relevant for our dataset.

Due to a short half-life and rapid elimination, multiple doses of ibuprofen are required in a day to maintain pharmacological action for a long duration of time. Due to multiple intakes of ibuprofen, certain severe adverse effects, such as gastric irritation, bleeding, ulcers, and abdominal pain are produced. Therefore, a system is needed which not only prolongs the release of ibuprofen but also overcomes the drug's adverse effects. Hence, the authors have synthesized chondroitin sulfate/sodium polystyrene sulfonate-co-poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels by the free radical polymerization technique for the controlled release of ibuprofen. Sol-gel, porosity, swelling, and drug release studies were performed on the fabricated hydrogel. The pH-responsive behavior of the fabricated hydrogel was determined by both swelling and drug release studies in three different pH values, i.e., pH 1.2, 4.6, and 7.4. Maximum swelling and drug release were observed at pH 7.4, as compared to pH 4.6 and 1.2. Similarly, the structural arrangement and crosslinking of the hydrogel contents were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluated the hard and irregular surface with a few macrospores of the developed hydrogel, which may be correlated with the strong crosslinking of polymers with monomer content. Similarly, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated the high thermal stability of the formulated hydrogel, as compared to pure polymers. A decrease in the crystallinity of chondroitin sulfate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate after crosslinking was revealed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD).

An aqueous insoluble hydrophobic anti-inflammatory compound, i.e., ibuprofen (IBU), was investigated in this study as the matrix-forming agent of a doxycycline hyclate (DH)-loaded solvent removal-induced in situ forming gel (ISG) using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and <i>N</i>-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvents. Their physicochemical properties, including pH, density, viscosity, surface tension, contact angle, water tolerance, injectability, mechanical properties, gel formation, and drug release, were determined. Their antimicrobial activities were tested using agar cup diffusion, and their anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using thermal inhibition of protein denaturation of egg albumin. Increasing the IBU content decreased the density, pH, surface tension, and contact angle but increased the viscosity, force and work of injection, and gel formation of IBU-based ISG solution. Although their water tolerance values decreased with the increase in IBU content, the addition of DH and the use of NMP led to high water tolerance. The characterization of the dried gel remnants of ISGs presented no change in IBU crystallinity and thermal properties and confirmed no chemical interaction among the components of ISGs. The obtained transformed IBU matrix prolonged the release of DH and IBU from ISGs over 7 days from its tortuously packed IBU matrix with small pores, and conformed well with Fickian diffusion mechanism.

The average cumulative mass of IBU after a 24 h permeation test from an emulsion-based gel formulation through human skin was 1.6-4.0 times higher than for the commercial products. Ibuprofen derivatives were evaluated as chemical penetration enhancers. After 24 h of penetration, the cumulative mass was 1086.6 ± 245.8 for IBUNa and 948.6 ± 87.5 µg IBU/cm<sup>2</sup> for [PheOEt][IBU], respectively.

Special emphasis was given to the potential applications of the examined oil gels as sustained delivery systems and as fat substitutes in food products. The applicability of oil gelators is envisaged in food, cosmetics, and the pharmaceutical industry. The regulations requiring the elimination of saturated fats and rising concerns among consumers health motivated us to investigate small organic molecules capable of efficiently transforming from liquid oil to a gel state. The oxalamide organogelators showed remarkable gelation efficiency in vegetable oils, thermal and mechanical stability, self-healing properties, and a long period of stability. The physical properties of the gels were analysed by TEM microscopy, DSC calorimetry, and oscillatory rheology. The controlled release properties of acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, and hydrocortisone were analysed by the LC-MS method. The influence of the oil type (sunflower, soybean, and olive oil) on gelation efficiency of diverse oxalamide derivatives was examined by oscillatory rheology. The oxalamide gelators showed thermoreversible and thixotropic properties in vegetable oils with a minimum gelation concentration of just 0.025 wt%.

The prepared PIMs can be obtained by a simple, fast, and high-yield preparation process. Physicochemical characterizations of such membranes occurred in a homogeneous structure. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis found that DBP was inserted between these polymeric chains by non-covalent interactions. This led to a spacing of PVC/poly(β-cyclodextrin) chains inducing a better access of guest molecules to PIM cyclodextrins. To achieve the elimination of ibuprofen and progesterone, two examples of emerging environmental contaminants that can lead to possible alterations to aquatic environments and affect human health, the effect of three operating parameters was studied (pH, the proportion of β-cyclodextrin polymer, and wastewater agitation). The proportion of β-cyclodextrin polymer and wastewater agitation had a favorable influence on drug extraction at 10 ppm.

Different tumor cells were treated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions with various drugs that affect cellular metabolism. HIF1α was silenced by siRNA in normoxic/hypoxic tumor cells, before RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed while using the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as a model. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed and validated by qPCR, while the activity of the metabolites was determined by enzyme assays. Under normoxic conditions, HIF1 activity was significantly increased by (i) glutamine metabolism, which was associated with the release of ammonium, and it was decreased by (ii) acetylation via acetyl CoA synthetase (ACSS2) or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), respectively, and (iii) the presence of L-ascorbic acid, citrate, or acetyl-CoA. Interestingly, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, L-ascorbic acid, and citrate each significantly destabilized HIF1α only under normoxia. The results from the deep sequence analyses indicated that, in HIF1-siRNA silenced MDA-MB-231 cells, 231 genes under normoxia and 1384 genes under hypoxia were transcriptionally significant deregulated in a HIF1-dependent manner. Focusing on glycolysis genes, it was confirmed that HIF1 significantly regulated six normoxic and 16 hypoxic glycolysis-associated gene transcripts. However, the results from the targeted metabolome analyses revealed that HIF1 activity affected neither the consumption of glucose nor the release of ammonium or lactate; however, it significantly inhibited the release of the amino acid alanine. This study comprehensively investigated, for the first time, how normoxic HIF1 is stabilized, and it analyzed the possible function of normoxic HIF1 in the transcriptome and metabolic processes of tumor cells in a breast cancer cell model.

The differences observed between human and rodent oligodendrocytes make animals inadequate for modeling these diseases. Although developing human in vitro models for oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons has been a great challenge, 3D cell cultures derived from iPSC are now available and able to partially reproduce the myelination process. We have previously developed a human iPSC-derived 3D brain organoid model (also called BrainSpheres) that contains a high percentage of myelinated axons and is highly reproducible. Here, we have further refined this technology by applying multiple readouts to study myelination disruption. Myelin was assessed by quantifying immunostaining/confocal microscopy of co-localized myelin basic protein (MBP) with neurofilament proteins as well as proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). Levels of PLP1 were also assessed by Western blot. We identified compounds capable of inducing developmental neurotoxicity by disrupting myelin in a systematic review to evaluate the relevance of our BrainSphere model for the study of the myelination/demyelination processes. Results demonstrated that the positive reference compound (cuprizone) and two of the three potential myelin disruptors tested (Bisphenol A, Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, but not methyl mercury) decreased myelination, while ibuprofen (negative control) had no effect.

The composites consisted of biomimetic hydroxyapatite (mHA) enriched with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, type I collagen, alginate, and, additionally, chitosan and sericin. The granules were loaded with ibuprofen sodium salt. The investigation encompassed a morphology characterization, a porosity analysis, a chemical structure assessment, and an examination of the swelling behavior, drug release kinetics (ibuprofen), and release profiles of zinc and magnesium ions. The granules exhibited irregular surfaces with an enhanced homogeneity in the chitosan-coated granules and well-developed mesoporous structures. The FT-IR spectra confirmed the presence of ibuprofen sodium, despite overlapping bands for the polymers. The granules demonstrated a high water-absorption capacity, with delayed swelling observed in the chitosan-coated granules. Ibuprofen displayed burst-release profiles, especially in the G1 and G3 samples. In the case of the chitosan-coated granules (G2 and G4), lower amounts of ibuprofen were released. In turn, there was a significant difference in the released amount of magnesium and zinc ions from the granules, which was most likely caused by their different location in the hydroxyapatite crystals. The cytotoxicity assays confirmed the non-cytotoxic behavior of the biomaterial. These findings suggest the potential applicability of these biomaterials in dental scenarios, emphasizing their multifunctional and biocompatible nature.",2023,,"Kołodziejska B, Figat R, Kolmas J.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/16751/pdf?version=1700902868,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed drug release kinetics for ibuprofen', 'Formulation specifics of the biomaterials', 'Swelling behavior analysis results']","The study specifically investigates ibuprofen release from composite granules, indicating measurable drug release endpoints and formulation information related to ibuprofen in a relevant context.",0.9

Yet, when exposed to toxic substances, the cell triggers multiple signals in response. With this in mind, we have developed a promising cell-based toxicity method that observes various cell responses when exposed to toxic substances (either death, division, or remain viable). Based on the collective cell response, we observed and predicted the dynamics of the cell population to determine the toxicity of the toxicant. The method was tested with two different conformations: In the first conformation, we exposed a monoculture model of blood macrophages to UV light, hydrogen peroxide, nutrient deprivation, tetrabromobisphenol A, fatty acids, and 5-fluorouracil. In the second, we exposed a coculture liver model consisting of hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to rifampicin, ibuprofen, and 5-fluorouracil. The method showed good accuracy compared to established toxicity assessment methods.

In the gastrointestinal tract, the primary enzyme responsible for metabolizing ingested histamine is diamine oxidase (DAO), and a shortage of this enzyme has been associated with some diseases related to the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, muscular, and digestive systems, in addition to migraines. The treatment of migraines typically revolves around the utilization of both anti-migraine and anti-inflammatory drugs, but their interaction with DAO is not thoroughly understood. In this study, we examined the impact of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anti-migraine medications on DAO activity through in vitro experiments. We also investigated their effects on the human intestinal cell line Caco-2, assessing changes in DAO expression (both at the mRNA and protein levels) as well as DAO activity. The tested drugs, including ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, a combination of acetylsalicylic acid with paracetamol and caffeine, zolmitriptan, and sumatriptan, did not inhibit DAO activity or reduce their levels.

To overcome this issue, the prior administration of high doses of HSA competitive binders, such as ibuprofen (IBF), has been proposed as a complementary clinical protocol to increase HD efficiency. In this work, we designed and prepared novel hybrid membranes conjugated with IBF, thus avoiding its administration to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Two novel silicon precursors containing IBF were synthesized and, by the combination of a sol-gel reaction and the phase inversion technique, four monophasic hybrid integral asymmetric cellulose acetate/silica/IBF membranes in which silicon precursors are covalently bonded to the cellulose acetate polymer were produced.

MED,39449423,39449423.0,10.3390/jox14040082,Pharmaceutical Pollutants: Ecotoxicological Impacts and the Use of Agro-Industrial Waste for Their Removal from Aquatic Environments.,"Medicines are pharmaceutical substances used to treat, prevent, or relieve symptoms of different diseases in animals and humans. However, their large-scale production and use worldwide cause their release to the environment. Pharmaceutical molecules are currently considered emerging pollutants that enter water bodies due to inadequate management, affecting water quality and generating adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Hence, different alternatives for pharmaceuticals removal from water have been sought; among them, the use of agro-industrial wastes has been proposed, mainly because of its high availability and low cost. This review highlights the adverse ecotoxicological effects related to the presence of different pharmaceuticals on aquatic environments and analyzes 94 investigations, from 2012 to 2024, on the removal of 17 antibiotics, highlighting sulfamethoxazole as the most reported, as well as 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac and ibuprofen, and 27 pharmaceutical drugs with different pharmacological activities. The removal of these drugs was evaluated using agro-industrial wastes such as wheat straw, mung bean husk, bagasse, bamboo, olive stones, rice straw, pinewood, rice husk, among others. On average, 60% of the agro-industrial wastes were transformed into biochar to be used as a biosorbents for pharmaceuticals removal. The diversity in experimental conditions among the removal studies makes it difficult to stablish which agro-industrial waste has the greatest removal capacity; therefore, in this review, the drug mass removal rate (DMRR) was calculated, a parameter used with comparative purposes. Almond shell-activated biochar showed the highest removal rate for antibiotics (1940 mg/g·h), while cork powder (CP) (10,420 mg/g·h) showed the highest for NSAIDs. Therefore, scientific evidence demonstrates that agro-industrial waste is a promising alternative for the removal of emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals substances.",2024,,"Estrada-Almeida AG, Castrejón-Godínez ML, Mussali-Galante P, Tovar-Sánchez E, Rodríguez A.",https://doi.org/10.3390/jox14040082,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,yes,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology on ibuprofen removal', 'Experimental conditions for ibuprofen', 'Measurable endpoints related to ibuprofen']","The abstract discusses the removal of pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen, using agro-industrial wastes, but does not provide specific details relevant to in vitro permeation studies or formulation information.",0.5

We compared hydroactive nanocellulose-based, silver-impregnated and ibuprofen-containing foam wound dressings. Methods: A total of 46 patients scheduled for elective surgery were evaluated on the STSG donor site for wound healing (time-to-healing, Hollander Wound Evaluation Scale), pain level (Visual Analogue Scale), and handling (ease of use), as well as scar quality (Patient Scar Assessment Scale, Vancouver Scar Scale) after 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: Almost all dressings compared equally well. We observed statistically relevant differences for pain level favoring the ibuprofen-containing dressing (p = 0.002, ΔAIC = 8.1), and user friendliness in favor of nanocellulose (dressing removal: p = 0.037, ΔAIC = 2.59; application on patient: p = 0.042, ΔAIC = 2.33; wound adhesion: p = 0.017, ΔAIC = 4.16; sensation on skin: p = 0.027, ΔAIC = 3.21). We did not observe any differences for wound healing across all groups. Treatment with hydroactive nanocellulose and the ibuprofen-containing foam revealed statistically relevant better scar appearances as compared to the silver wound dressing (p < 0.001, ΔAIC = 14.77). Conclusion: All wound dressings performed equally well, with the detected statistical differences hinting future directions of clinical relevance. These include the reserved use of silver containing dressings for contaminated or close to contaminated wounds, and the facilitated clinical application of the nanocellulose dressing, which was the only suitable candidate in this series to be impregnated with a range of additional therapeutic agents (e.g., disinfectants and pain-modulating drugs).

Therefore, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are frequently used as a concomitant medication to reduce this risk. However, the impact of NSAIDs or metamizole, in combination with PPIs, on bone metabolism is still unclear. Therefore, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were cultured in monolayer cultures in 10 different groups for 21 days. New bone formation was induced as follows: Group 1 negative control group, group 2 osteogenic differentiation media (OSM), group 3 OSM with pantoprazole (PAN), group 4 OSM with ibuprofen (IBU), group 5 OSM with diclofenac (DIC), group 6 OSM with metamizole (MET), group 7 OSM with ibuprofen and pantoprazole (IBU + PAN), group 8 OSM with diclofenac and pantoprazole (DIC + PAN), group 9 OSM with metamizole and pantoprazole (MET + PAN) and group 10 OSM with diclofenac, metamizole and pantoprazole (DIC + MET + PAN). Hydroxyapatite content was evaluated using high-sensitive radioactive <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HDP labeling. Within this study, no evidence was found that the common analgetic medication, using NSAIDs alone or in combination with pantoprazole and/or metamizole, has any negative impact on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. To the contrary, the statistical results indicate that pantoprazole alone (group 3 (PAN) (<i>p</i> = 0.016)) or diclofenac alone (group 5 (DIC) (<i>p</i> = 0.008)) enhances the deposition of minerals by hMSCS in vitro. There is an ongoing discussion between clinicians in the field of orthopaedics and traumatology as to whether post-surgical (pain) medication has a negative impact on bone healing. This is the first hMSC in vitro study that investigates the effects of pain medication in combination with PPIs on bone metabolism.

The percutaneous permeation across the human skin and transdermal diffusion test model (Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membranes) of ibuprofen and its structural modification were measured and compared using Franz diffusion cells. For comparison, the penetration of ibuprofen from a commercial product was also investigated. The cumulative amount of drug permeated through human skin at the end of the 24 h study was highest for ibuprofen derivatives containing propyl (C3), isopropyl (C3), ethyl (C2), and butyl (C4) esters. For Strat-M<sup>®</sup>, the best results were obtained with the alkyl chain length of the ester from C2 to C5. The permeation profiles and parameters were appointed, such as steady-state flux, lag time, and permeability coefficient. It has been shown that L-valine alkyl ester ibuprofenates, with the propyl, butyl, and amyl chain, exhibit a higher permeation rate than ibuprofen.

Different vegetable (castor, canola, olive, peanut, grapeseed, linseed), mineral (paraffin) and semisynthetic (isopropyl myristate, oleic acid) oils were screened for ibuprofen (IBU) solubility and for their capacity for high-shear emulsification in a 17% (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>) aqueous solution of poloxamer 407. Chosen emulgels were subject to a rheological evaluation, a syringeability test (TA.XT texture analyser; 2 mL syringe; 18 G, 20 G and 22 G needles) and a drug release study (48 h; cellulose membrane; 0.05 mol/L phosphate buffer at pH 7.4). Castor oil turned out to be an optimal component for IBU incorporation. Blank and drug-loaded castor oil emulgels were susceptible to administration via a syringe and needle, with the absolute injection force not exceeding 3 kg (29.4 N). The drug release test revealed dose-dependent, quasi-linear kinetics, with up to 44 h of controlled, steady, linear release.

It has been classified as a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC) that has received global attention in the search for a better wastewater separation technology. The emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) is one of the potential solutions for IBP removal from wastewater owing to its advantages, such as the ability to remove a highly soluble solute, energy efficient and tuneable formulation. To develop this ELM, a series of parameters such as stirring speed, emulsification time, organic to internal phase volume ratio (O/I), internal phase concentration, carrier concentration and surfactant concentration were studied. The extraction was carried out for 15 min stirring time and the concentration of IBP in the feed phase was determined using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The optimum formulation for the ELM was found at 300 rpm stirring speed, 20 min emulsification time, 3:1 of O/I, 0.1 M ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub> (stripping agent), 6 wt% trioctylamine, TOA (carrier) and 2 wt% sorbitan monooleate, Span 80 (non-ionic surfactant).

The influence of the structure and properties of the tested compounds on the retention coefficient and filtration rate was investigated. The influence of pH on the filtration parameters was also checked. The properties of selected membranes influencing the retention of pharmaceuticals and filtrate flux were analysed. An extensive analysis of the retention coefficients dependence on the contact angle and surface free energy was performed. It was found that there is a correlation between the hydrophilicity of the membrane and the effectiveness and efficiency of the membrane. As the contact angle of membrane increased, the flow rate of the filtrate stream increased, while the retention coefficient decreased. The studies showed that the best separation efficiency was achieved for compounds with a molecular weight (MW) greater than 300 g/mol. During the filtration of pharmaceuticals with MW ranging from 300 to 450 g/mol, the type of membrane used practically did not affect the filtration efficiency and a high degree of retention was achieved.

The morphology and elemental composition of the active layer of unmodified and modified membranes were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. Initial characterization membranes was carried out, studying their water permeability coefficient and their permeate flux and rejection coefficients, at different applied pressures, using magnesium chloride solutions. The behavior of both pristine and coated membranes against ibuprofen solutions were analyzed by studying the permeate fluxes and the rejection coefficients at different pressures and at different contaminant concentrations.

The principles of PMRs are based on photocatalytic degradation and membrane rejection, the different processes occurring simultaneously. Coupled photocatalysis and membrane filtration has made PMRs suitable for application in the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs), such as diclofenac, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, lincomycin, diphenhydramine, rhodamine, and tamoxifen, from wastewater, while reducing the likelihood of byproducts being present in the permeate stream. The viability of PMRs depends on the hypotheses used during design and the kinetic properties of the systems. The choice of design models and the assumptions made in their application can have an impact on reactor design outcomes. A design's resilience is due to the development of a mathematical model that links material and mass balances to various sub-models, including the fluid dynamic model, the radiation emission model, the radiation absorption model, and the kinetic model. Hence, this review addresses the discrepancies with traditional kinetic models, fluid flow dynamics, and radiation emission and absorption, all of which have an impact on upscaling and reactor design. Computational and analytical descriptions of how to develop a PMR system with high throughput, performance, and energy efficiency are provided. The potential solutions are classified according to the catalyst, fluid dynamics, thickness, geometry, and light source used. Two main PMR types are comprehensively described, and a discussion of various influential factors relating to PMRs was used as a premise for developing an ideal reactor. The aim of this work was to resolve potential divergences that occur during PMRs design as most real reactors do not conform to the idealized fluid dynamics.

TEM micrographs showed uniform distribution of Ag/Pd nanoparticles within the PES matrix, while SEM images showed uniform, fingerlike structures that were not affected by the presence of embedded nanoparticles. The presence of Ag/Pd nanoparticles resulted in rougher membranes. There was an increase in membrane hydrophilicity with increasing nanoparticles loading, which resulted in improved pure water permeability (37−135 Lm2h−1bar−1). The membranes exhibited poor salt rejection (<15%), making them less susceptible to flux decline due to concentration polarization.

This plant contains small amounts of essential oil whose composition and properties have not been extensively investigated. There are few reports in the literature on the antioxidant and antifungal properties of this essential oil and the possibility of applying it as a potential promoter of the skin penetration of drugs. The essential oil was obtained by distillation using a Clavenger type apparatus. The chemical composition was analyzed by the GC-MS method. The major active compounds of <i>E. angustifolium</i> L. essential oil (EOEa) were terpenes, including α-caryophyllene oxide, eucalyptol, β-linalool, camphor, (S)-carvone, and β-caryophyllene. The analyzed essential oil was also characterized by antioxidant activity amounting to 78% RSA (Radical Scavenging Activity). Antifungal activity against the strains <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>A. ochraceus</i>, <i>A. parasiticum</i>, and <i>Penicillium cyclopium</i> was also determined. The largest inhibition zone was observed for strains from the <i>Aspergillus</i> group. The EOEa enhanced the percutaneous penetration of ibuprofen and lidocaine. After a 24 h test, the content of terpene in the skin and the acceptor fluid was examined. It has been shown that the main compounds contained in the essential oil do not penetrate through the skin, but accumulate in it. Additionally, FTIR-ATR analysis showed a disturbance of the <i>stratum corneum</i> (SC) lipids caused by the essential oil application. Due to its rich composition and high biological activity, EOEa may be a potential candidate to be applied, for example, in the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries.

OMCs' efficiency could be further increased by embedding them into a hydrogel phase for an <i>in loco</i> prolonged drug release. In this work, OMCs were embedded into injectable thermosensitive hydrogels. In detail, rod-like (diameter ca. 250 nm, length ca. 700 nm) and spherical (diameter approximately 120 nm) OMCs were synthesized by nanocasting selected templates and loaded with ibuprofen through a melt infiltration method to achieve complete filling of their pores (100% loading yield). In parallel, an amphiphilic Poloxamer® 407-based poly(ether urethane) was synthesized (Mn¯ 72 kDa) and solubilized at 15 and 20% <i>w/v</i> concentration in saline solution to design thermosensitive hydrogels. OMC incorporation into the hydrogels (10 mg/mL concentration) did not negatively affect their gelation potential. Hybrid systems successfully released ibuprofen at a slower rate compared to control gels (gels embedding ibuprofen as such), but with no significant differences between rod-like and spherical OMC-loaded gels. OMCs can thus work as effective drug reservoirs that progressively release their payload over time and also upon encapsulation in a hydrogel phase, thus opening the way to their application to treat many different pathological states (e.g., as topical medications).",2020,,"Boffito M, Laurano R, Giasafaki D, Steriotis T, Papadopoulos A, Tonda-Turo C, Cassino C, Charalambopoulou G, Ciardelli G.",https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10112165,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology of ibuprofen loading', 'Release kinetics data', 'Comparison of permeation with and without OMCs', 'Characterization of hydrogels and OMCs']","The abstract discusses the release profile of ibuprofen from hydrogels containing ordered mesoporous carbons, indicating a relevant study for the dataset.

Compared to monoaxial nanofibers, core-shell nanofibers can control the drug release profile easier, providing sustainable and effective drugs and growth factors for wound healing. However, it is challenging to produce core-shell structured nanofibers with a high production rate at low energy consumption. Co-axial centrifugal spinning is an alternative method to address the above limitations to produce core-shell nanofibers effectively. In this study, a co-axial centrifugal spinning device was designed and assembled to produce core-shell nanofibers for controlling the release rate of ibuprofen and hEGF in inflammation and proliferation phases during the wound healing process. Core-shell structured nanofibers were confirmed by TEM. This work demonstrated that the co-axial centrifugal spinning is a high productivity process that can produce materials with a 3D environment mimicking natural tissue scaffold, and the specific drug can be loaded into different layers to control the drug release rate to improve the drug efficiency and promote wound healing.",2021,,"Li Z, Mei S, Dong Y, She F, Li P, Li Y, Kong L.",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/11/6/1546/pdf?version=1623405753,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed drug release profiles', 'Formulation specifics of ibuprofen nanofibers', 'Methodology of drug loading and release testing', 'Comparative efficacy of drug release profiles over time']","The study involves controlled release of ibuprofen in nanofibers, which is relevant for permeation studies.

Traditional treatment methods often fail to adequately degrade these contaminants. This study explored the efficacy of a hybrid ozonation membrane filtration (HOMF) process using CeO<sub>2</sub> and CeTiO<sub>x</sub>-doped ceramic crossflow ultrafiltration ceramic membranes for the degradation of OMPs. Hollow ceramic membranes (CM) with a 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) were modified to serve as substrates for catalytic nanosized metal oxides in a crossflow and inside-out operational configuration. Three types of depositions were tested: a single layer of CeO<sub>2</sub>, a single layer of CeTiO<sub>x</sub>, and a combined layer of CeO<sub>2</sub> + CeTiO<sub>x</sub>. These catalytic nanoparticles were distributed uniformly using a solution-based method supported by vacuum infiltration to ensure high-throughput deposition. The results demonstrated successful infiltration of the metal oxides, although the yield permeability and transmembrane flow varied, following this order: pristine > CeTiO<sub>x</sub> > CeO<sub>2</sub> > CeO<sub>2</sub> + CeTiO<sub>x</sub>. Four OMPs were examined: two easily degraded by ozone (carbamazepine and diclofenac) and two recalcitrant (ibuprofen and pCBA). The highest OMP degradation was observed in demineralized water, particularly with the CeO<sub>2</sub> + CeTiO<sub>x</sub> modification, suggesting O<sub>3</sub> decomposition to hydroxyl radicals.

Currently, it affects 1% of the population, with a projection to exceed 23 million cases by 2030. Despite significant advancements, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the first line of treatment, are associated with a range of adverse effects. Consequently, plant-based derivatives are being utilized as an effective alternative. This study evaluates the anti-inflammatory and safety profile of <i>Colchicum luteum</i> hydroethanolic extract (CLHE) in comparison to NSAIDs, with a focus on COX-2 and TNFα inhibition.<h4>Methods</h4>CLHE potential was evaluated by phytochemical screening and in vitro bioactivity assays. Toxicity profile was conducted in Human Colon Epithelial Cells (HCEC) and Balb/c mice. Anti-inflammatory potential was explored in a collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) mice model. Bioactive compounds were identified computationally from GCMS data and subjected to docking and simulation studies against COX2 and TNFα.<h4>Results</h4>CLHE demonstrated significant antioxidant (IC-50 = 6.78 µg/mL) and anti-inflammatory (IC-50 = 97.39 µg/mL) activity. It maintained 50% cell viability at 78.5 μg/µL in HCEC cells and exhibited no toxicity at a dose of 5000 mg/kg in mice. In the CIA model, CLHE significantly reduced paw swelling, arthritic scoring, C-reactive protein levels, and spleen indices, outperforming ibuprofen. Expression analysis confirmed the downregulation of COX-2, TNFα, and MMP-9.

Additionally, our results show significant synergy between water soluble Na-ibuprofen (IBU-Na) and ionic strength. Salt concentrations above 0.5 M modify the zeta potential promoting the action of Na-IBU; thus, with 1 M sodium chloride, IBU-Na is ten times more efficient than in the absence of ionic strength, and the minimum effective contact time is reduced from hours to minutes. In short time periods, where neither IBU-Na nor controls with 1 M NaCl show activity, the combination of both leads to a reduction in the bacterial load. We also analyzed whether the changes caused by salt on the bacterial membrane also promoted the activity of other microbicide compounds used in cystic fibrosis like gentamicin, tobramycin and phosphomycin. The results show that the presence of ionic strength only enhanced the bactericidal activity of the amphipathic molecule of IBU-Na. In this respect, the effect of saline concentration was also reflected in the surface properties of IBU-Na, where, in addition to the clear differences observed between 145 mM and 1 M, singular behaviors were also found, different in each condition.

Cu<sup>2+</sup> and ibuprofen were co-released over time in a sustained manner with a significantly lower burst release compared to MBG particles alone (burst release reduction approx. 85% and 65% for ibuprofen and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, respectively). Additionally, released Cu<sup>2+</sup> species triggered polyurethane chemical degradation, thus enabling a possible tuning of gel residence time at the pathological site.

The treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) aims to reduce pain and improve function. An innovative magnetophoresis technology has been developed that facilitates transdermal delivery of ibuprofen. The study used measures that were taken over a relatively short time period to monitor the pharmacodynamic response to ibuprofen. Each participant received magnetophoresis-enhanced transdermal ibuprofen or placebo in randomised order, with a five-day washout period. The participants were 24 volunteers with medically diagnosed, painful knee OA. The primary outcome measures were VAS rating of pain on movement and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain and function scores. VAS for pain on movement (<i>p</i> < 0.001), WOMAC pain score (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and WOMAC function score (<i>p</i> = 0.004) were all significantly improved. There was a significant reduction in movement-related pain (<i>p</i> < 0.05) during the first patch application and for the remainder of the study period. The number needed to treat for a 50% reduction in movement related pain was 2.2. The study showed a rapid and significant analgesic effect in response to transdermal ibuprofen.

However, several factors such as skin, physicochemical properties of the drug, and vehicle characteristics influence the permeation. Within a formulation, critical factors such as concentration of drug, physical state of drug in the formulation, and organoleptic properties affect the flux across the skin. The aim of the study was to develop and investigate topical semisolid preparations (creams and gels) with ibuprofen as the model drug and investigate the effect of various formulation parameters on the in-vitro performance across the Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane using flow-through cells. In addition, the physical stability of the developed formulations was investigated by studying viscosity, pH, and appearance. All the formulations developed in the study had appealing appearance with smooth texture and no signs of separation. Viscosity and pH of the formulations were acceptable. Cumulative amount of drug permeated at the end of 24 h was highest for clear gel (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> ibuprofen; F6: 739.6 ± 36.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>) followed by cream with high concentration of ibuprofen in suspended form (5% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>; F3: 320.8 ± 17.53 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), emulgel (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> ibuprofen; F5: 178.5 ± 34.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and cream with solubilized ibuprofen (3% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>; F2A: 163.2 ± 9.36 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>). Results from this study showed that permeation of ibuprofen was significantly influenced by formulation parameters such as concentration of ibuprofen (3% vs. 5% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), physical state of ibuprofen (solubilized vs. suspended), formulation type (cream vs. gel), mucoadhesive agents, and viscosity (high vs. low).

The size reduction makes the eutectic formation a viable option to improve the dissolution rate of the poorly soluble APIs. In the present study, ibuprofen, naproxen, and sorafenib were investigated in terms of their phase behaviors with fatty alcohols, such as tetradecanol, octadecanol, and docosanol. Among the studied APIs, only ibuprofen was able to form eutectics with the fatty alcohols, and this was in agreement with the feasibility prediction based on the van 't Hoff equation and solubility parameters. In vitro release behavior was significantly improved for the ibuprofen/octadecanol eutectic mixture, although the practical insolubility of octadecanol in water was the opposite of the outstanding hydrophilicity of usual eutectic formers.

However, their biological performance has not yet been carefully scrutinized. Herein, THEDES based on the binary mixture of perillyl alcohol (POH) and ibuprofen (IBU) were prepared using different molar ratios. Our comprehensive strategy includes the characterization of their thermal and structural behavior to identify the molar ratios that successfully form deep eutectic systems. The in vitro solubility of the different systems prepared has demonstrated that, unlike other reported examples, the presence of the terpene did not affect the solubility of the anti-inflammatory agent in a physiological simulated media. The biological performance of the systems was studied in terms of their antimicrobial activity against a wide panel of microorganisms. The examined THEDES showed relevant antimicrobial activity against all tested microbial strains, with the exception of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. A synergistic effect from the combination of POH and IBU as a eutectic system was verified. Furthermore, the cytotoxic profile of these eutectic systems towards colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro cell models was also evaluated. The results provide the indication that the cell viability varies in a dose-dependent manner, with a selective THEDES action towards CRC cells. With tunable bioactivities in a ratio-dependent manner, THEDES enhanced the antimicrobial and anticancer properties, representing a possible alternative to conventional therapies. Therefore, this study provides foreseeable indications about the utility of THEDES based on POH and IBU as strong candidates for novel active pharmaceutical systems.",2020,,"Silva E, Oliveira F, Silva JM, Matias A, Reis RL, Duarte ARC.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12111121,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,yes,uncertain,"['In vitro permeation/release results', 'Study of diffusion cell methods', 'Formulation details of THEDES with ibuprofen', 'Comparison of bioavailability metrics', 'Detailed outcomes on antimicrobial and anticancer activity']","The study focuses on the characterization of THEDES and their biological performance rather than on specific percutaneous permeation/release data, making it less relevant for the dataset.",0.7

To select safe excipients for nanoemulsion formulation and to discard any haemolytic potential, an in vitro miniaturized test was performed on human whole blood. From haemolysis results obtained on eighteen of the most commonly used excipients, a medium chain triglyceride, a surfactant, and a solubilizer were selected for formulation assays. Based on a design of experiments and a ternary diagram, the feasibility of nanoemulsions was determined. The composition was defined to produce monodisperse nanodroplets with a diameter of either 50 or 120 nm, and their physicochemical properties were optimized to be suitable for intravenous administration. These nanoemulsions, stable over 21 days in storage conditions, were shown to be able to encapsulate with high encapsulation efficiency and high drug loading, up to 16% (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), two water practically insoluble drug models: ibuprofen and fenofibrate.

The broth microdilution checkerboard assay revealed synergistic interactions between all investigated antipyretics, namely acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, with EEPs samples. The values of the fractional inhibitory concentration (ΣFIC) index for all these combinations were <0.5. While, in the case of considered antiseptics, namely chlorhexidine, octenidine dihydrochloride, and 2-phenoxyethanol, the positive interaction was confirmed only for the last one (values of ΣFIC in the range 0.0625-0.25). Combinations of two other agents with all four samples of EEPs resulted in an important antagonistic effect (values of ΣFIC ≥ 4.5). Propolis is mostly dedicated to the treatment of skin/wound infections; thus, these findings are of particular practical importance. The outcomes of the study also support the hypothesis that the propolis's antimicrobial effect is due to the combined (synergistic) action of several ingredients rather than the presence of one component of high antibacterial activity.

The objective of this study was to produce taste-masked ibuprofen granules using a novel process, twin-screw melt granulation (TSMG). TSMG is an emerging, high-productivity, continuous process. Granules of ibuprofen embedded in a lipid matrix were produced across a range of process conditions, resulting in a range of output granule particle sizes. The ibuprofen appeared to be miscible with the lipid binder though it recrystallized after processing. The ibuprofen melt granules were tested in simulated saliva using a novel, small-volume dissolution technique with continuous acquisition of the ibuprofen concentration. The ibuprofen release from the granules was slower than the neat API and physical blend, beyond the expected residence time of the granules in the mouth.

These drugs must overcome the skin barrier to cause a therapeutic effect. Human skin has been widely used as a model to study in vitro drug diffusion and permeation, however, it suffers from many limitations. Therefore, to perform in vitro permeation test (IVPT), we used a Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane with diffusion characteristics well-correlated to human skin. This study's objective was to optimize the IVPT conditions using Plackett-Burman experimental design for bio-predictive evaluation of the in vitro permeation rates of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, etofenamate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen) across Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane from commercial topical formulations. The Plackett-Burman factorial design was used to screen the effect of seven factors in eight runs with one additional center point. This tool allowed us to set the sensitive and discriminative IVPT final conditions that can appropriately characterize the NSAIDs formulations.

Ibuprofen, tofacitinib citrate, rhodamine B, and lidocaine were loaded into proposomes. These drug formulations were analyzed for particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, and in vitro skin permeation. The confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on skin treated with calcein and rhodamine B laden proposomes. The transdermal delivery relative to physicochemical properties of drugs such as logP, melting point, molecular weight, solubility, etc., were analyzed. We tested the safety of the proposomes using reconstructed human skin tissue equivalents, which were fabricated in-house. We also used human cadaver skin samples as a control. The proposomes had an average diameter of 128 to 148 nm. The drug's entrapment efficiencies were in the range of 42.9-52.7%, translating into the significant enhancement of drug permeation through the skin. The enhancement ratio was 1.4 to 4.0, and linearly correlated to logP, molecular weight, and melting point. Confocal imaging also showed higher skin permeation of calcein and rhodamine B in proposome than in solution. The proposome was found safe for skin application.

In fact, their extremely high exposed surface area and pore volume allow to load and the release of several drugs, while their framework can be enriched with specific therapeutic ions allowing to boost the tissue regeneration. However, due to the open and easily accessible mesopore structure of MBG, the release of the incorporated therapeutic molecules shows an initial burst effect leading to unsuitable release kinetics. Hence, a still open challenge in the design of drug delivery systems based on MBGs is the control of their release behavior. In this work, Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of polyelectrolyte multi-layers was exploited as a powerful and versatile technique for coating the surface of Cu-substituted MBG nanoparticles with innovative multifunctional drug delivery systems for co-releasing of therapeutic copper ions (exerting pro-angiogenic and anti-bacterial effects) and an anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen). Two different routes were investigated: in the first strategy, chitosan and alginate were assembled by forming the multi-layered surface, and, successively, ibuprofen was loaded by incipient wetness impregnation, while in the second approach, alginate was replaced by ibuprofen, introduced as polyelectrolyte layer. Zeta-potential, TGA and FT-IR spectroscopy were measured after the addition of each polyelectrolyte layer, confirming the occurrence of the stepwise deposition. In addition, the in vitro bioactivity and the ability to modulate the release of the cargo were evaluated. The polyelectrolyte coated-MBGs were proved to retain the peculiar ability to induce hydroxyapatite formation after 7 days of soaking in Simulated Body Fluid.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been utilised to enhance the nanogels' loading ability towards poorly soluble drugs and promote/sustain drug release. However, formation of CD-based nanogels requires the use of specially modified CDs, or of crosslinking agents. The aim of this work was to develop a CD-based nanogel to improve the cutaneous delivery of ibuprofen by using the soluble β-cyclodextrin/epichlorohydrin polymer (EPIβCD) without adding any potentially toxic crosslinker. The use of EPIβCD enabled increasing ibuprofen loading due to its complexing/solubilizing power towards the poorly soluble drug and prolonging drug release over time due to the nanogel formation. DLS analysis proved that EPIβCD allowed the formation of nanostructures ranging from 60 up to 400 nm, depending on the gelling agent type and the gel preparation method. EPIβCD replacement with monomeric HPβCD did not lead in any case to nanogel formation. Permeation experiments using skin-simulating artificial membranes proved that the EPIβCD-based nanogel enhanced ibuprofen solubility and release, increasing its permeation rate up to 3.5 times, compared to a reference formulation without CD and to some commercial gel formulations, and also assured a sustained release. Moreover, EPIβCD replacement with HPβCD led to a marked increase in drug solubility and initial release rate, but did not provide a prolonged release due to the lack of a nano-matrix structure controlling drug diffusion.",2022,,"Cirri M, Nerli G, Mennini N, Maestrelli F, Mura P.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/12/2567/pdf?version=1669189115,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on formulations used', 'Specifics of permeability measurements', 'Data on release rates and duration', 'Comparative analysis with other formulations']","The study focuses on enhancing ibuprofen delivery using a novel nanogel system and presents measurable permeation data, which is crucial for the dataset.

All materials were characterized by various analytical techniques and applied as a platform for delivery of selected drug molecules. On the basis of X-ray diffraction (presence of reflections in the 2θ angle range of 1.5-2.5°) and low-temperature nitrogen sorption isotherms (mixture of isotherms of I and IV type) additional secondary porosity was found in the mesopore range. Additional tests were also conducted to determine the possibility of loading selected molecules with biological activity into the aforementioned materials and then releasing them in the therapeutic process. Molecules with different therapeutic options were selected for testing, namely ibuprofen, curcumin, and ferulic acid with anti-inflammatory, potentially anticancer, antioxidant, and skin discoloration activities, respectively.

Nevertheless, the properties of these nanosystems still need to be improved to enable knowledge transfer to the pharmaceutical industry and the development of more efficacious topical medicines. Quality-by-design strategies, such as Box-Behnken factorial design (BBD), are in line with the current need to use sustainable processes to develop new formulations. Thus, this work aimed at optimizing the physicochemical properties of transfersomes for cutaneous applications, by applying a BBD strategy to incorporate mixed edge activators with opposing hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB). Tween<sup>®</sup> 80 and Span<sup>®</sup> 80 were used as edge activators and ibuprofen sodium salt (IBU) was selected as the model drug. After the initial screening of the IBU solubility in aqueous media, a BBD protocol was implemented, and the optimized formulation displayed appropriate physicochemical properties for skin delivery. By comparing the optimized transfersomes to equivalent liposomes, the incorporation of mixed edge activators was found to be beneficial to upgrade the storage stability of the nanosystems. Furthermore, their cytocompatibility was shown by cell viability studies using 3D HaCaT cultures.

The bacterial infections that occur in burn wounds might be treated using different topically applied materials, but bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a major problem worldwide. Therefore, the use of non-antibiotic treatments represents a major interest in current research. In this study, new antibiocomposite hydrogels with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties based on hyaluronic acid (HA) and sodium alginate (AG) were obtained using 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazinyl-2)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride as an activator. The combination of Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to reduce inflammation, fever and pain in the body, with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was used in this study aimed at creating a complex hydrogel with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial action and capable of improving the healing process of wounds caused by burns. FTIR spectra confirmed the cross-linking of AG with HA as well as the successful incorporation of ZnO NPs. Using electronic microscopy, it was noticed that the morphology of hydrogels is influenced by the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles. Moreover, the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles into hydrogels also has an influence on the swelling behavior at both pH 7.4 and 5.4. In fact, the swelling rate is lower when the amounts of the activator, HA and ZnO NPs are high. A drug release rate of almost 100% was observed for hydrogels without ZnO NPs, whereas the addition of nanoparticles to hydrogels led to a decrease in the release rate to 68% during 24 h. Cellular viability tests demonstrated the non-cytotoxic behavior of the hydrogels without the ZnO NPs, whereas a weak to moderate cytotoxic effect was noticed for hydrogels with ZnO NPs. The hydrogels containing 4% and 5% ZnO NPs, respectively, showed good antimicrobial activity against the <i>S. aureus</i> strain. These preliminary data prove that these types of hydrogels can be of interest as biomaterials for the treatment of burn wounds.",2023,,"Rata DM, Cadinoiu AN, Daraba OM, Gradinaru LM, Atanase LI, Ichim DL.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15092240,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed drug release mechanisms', 'Specific in vitro permation techniques used', 'Data on cytotoxicity effects', 'Comparative analysis with other formulations']","The study focuses on a hydrogel formulation with ibuprofen but does not specifically mention its diffusion through Franz diffusion cells.

Gelucire<sup>®</sup> 44/14, Gelucire<sup>®</sup> 48/16, and Transcutol<sup>®</sup> HP were screened as suitable excipients for developing the SEDDS formulations. Initially, liquid SEDDS (L-SEDDS) were developed with oil concentrations between 20-50% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> and surfactant to co-surfactant ratios of 2:1, 4:1, 6:1. The stable formulations of L-SEDDS were transformed into solid SEDDS (S-SEDDS) using a suitable adsorbent carrier and compressed into tablets (T-SEDDS). The S-SEDDS has improved flow, drug release profiles, and permeability compared to pure drugs. The existence of the drug in an amorphous state was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD). The formulations with 20% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> and 30% <i>w</i>/<i>w</i> of oil concentration and a 4:1 ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant have resulted in a stable homogeneous emulsion with a globule size of 14.67 ± 0.23 nm and 18.54 ± 0.55 nm.

The investigation begins by exploring the physical properties and gel formation behaviour of the ISGs, with a particular focus on determining their sustained release capabilities. To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions and dynamics within the ISGs, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations are employed. The effects of adding IBU and DH on reducing surface tension and water tolerance properties, thus affecting molecular properties. The phase transformation phenomenon is observed around the interface, where droplets of ISGs move out to the water phase, leading to the precipitation of IBU around the interface. The optimization of drug release profiles ensures sustained local drug release over seven days, with a burst release observed on the first day. Interestingly, different organic solvents show varying abilities to control DH release, with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) demonstrating superior control compared to <i>N</i>-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). MD simulations using AMBER20 software provide valuable insights into the movement of individual molecules, as evidenced by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values. The addition of IBU to the system results in the retardation of IBU molecule movement, particularly evident in the DMSO series, with the diffusion constant value of DH reducing from 1.2452 to 0.3372 and in the NMP series from 0.3703 to 0.2245 after adding IBU. The RMSD values indicate a reduction in molecule fluctuation of DH, especially in the DMSO system, where it decreases from over 140 to 40 Å. Moreover, their radius of gyration is influenced by IBU, with the DMSO system showing lower values, suggesting an increase in molecular compactness. Notably, the DH-IBU configuration exhibits stable pairing through H-bonding, with a higher amount of H-bonding observed in the DMSO system, which is correlated with the drug retardation efficacy.

Four different materials were synthesized using succinic anhydride (CsSUC), maleic anhydride (CsMAL), itaconic acid (CsITA), and <i>trans</i>-aconitic acid (CsTACON) as grafting agents. After synthesis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed before and after DCF adsorption.

In this study, GO membranes were prepared through filtration by a pressure-assisted self-assembly method involving the cross-linking of three diamine monomers on a polyethersulfone (PES) support. The different small molecular diamines, ethylenediamine, butanediamine, and p-phenylenediamine, were introduced as cross-linking agents to investigate the effect of diamine on the properties of GO membranes. The hydrophobic substances ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and triclosan were selected as target pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The adsorption and molecular sieving activities of PPCPs by cross-linked GO membranes at a pH of 3 were investigated. The permeate water was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm, molecular weight distribution, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. The results showed that the removal of hydrophobic PPCPs by GO membranes was mainly due to their adsorption and molecular sieving activities.

Biodegradable coatings based on poly(lactic acid-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid), PLGA, represent versatile and safe candidates for surface modification of implantable biomaterials and devices, providing additional tunable ability for topical delivery of desired therapeutic agents. In the present study, Ibuprofen-loaded PLGA coatings (PLGA/IBUP) were obtained by using the dip-coating and drop-casting combined protocol. The composite materials demonstrated long-term drug release under biologically simulated dynamic conditions. Reversible swelling phenomena of polymeric coatings occurred in the first two weeks of testing, accompanied by the gradual matrix degradation and slow release of the therapeutic agent. Irreversible degradation of PLGA coatings occurred after one month, due to copolymer's hydrolysis (evidenced by chemical and structural modifications). After 30 days of dynamic testing, the cumulative release of IBUP was ~250 µg/mL. Excellent cytocompatibility was revealed on human-derived macrophages, fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The results herein evidence the promising potential of PLGA/IBUP coatings to be used for surface modification of medical devices, such as metallic implants and wound dressings.",2021,,"Gherasim O, Popescu-Pelin G, Florian P, Icriverzi M, Roseanu A, Mitran V, Cimpean A, Socol G.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/13/9/1413/pdf?version=1619597555,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology of drug release testing', 'Specific diffusion cell setup used', 'Quantification methods for drug release', 'Comparison with existing formulations']","The study directly investigates the drug release profile of ibuprofen from PLGA coatings, aligning with the focus on in vitro permeation methodologies.

An analysis of the kinetic release profile of Ib showed noticeable differences due to the presence or absence of the poly-AAm hydrogel polymer. Poly-AAm coating facilitated a constant release rate of drug as opposed to a more conventional burst release. The non-coated CANFs showed low cumulative drug release concentrations (ca. 35 and 83% at 5 and 10% loading, respectively). Conversely, poly-AAm coated CANFs were found to promote the release of drug (ca. 84 and 99.8% at 5 and 10% loading, respectively).

Because the formulation applied to the nasal cavity is discharged to the pharyngeal side by mucociliary clearance, the formulation should be dissolved effectively in a limited amount of mucus within its retention time in the nasal cavity. In this study, to develop novel formulations with improved dissolution behavior and compatibility with the intranasal environment, a thin-film formulation including drug and polymer was prepared using a vacuum-drying method. The poorly water-soluble drugs ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, and loxoprofen were dissolved in a solvent comprising water and methanol, and evaporated to obtain a thin film. Physical analyses using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction analysis (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy SEM revealed that the formulations were amorphized in the film. The dissolution behavior of the drugs was investigated using an in vitro evaluation system that mimicked the intranasal physiological environment.

As a polymer matrix Eudragit EPO (E-EPO) and as an API ibuprofen (IBU) were used in the research. In addition, the plasticizer Compritol 888 ATO (COM) was tested as a factor potentially improving processing parameters and modifying the IBU release profile. In studies, 25% by weight of IBU, 10% of COM and various extrusion temperatures, i.e., 90, 100, 120, 130, and 140 °C, were used. Hot melt extrusion (HME) temperatures were selected based on the glass transition temperature of the polymer matrix (T<sub>g</sub> = 42 °C) and the melting points of IBU (T<sub>m</sub> = 76 °C) and COM (T<sub>m</sub> = 73 °C), which were tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal stability of the tested compounds, determined on the basis of measurements carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), was also taken into account. HME resulted in amorphous E-EPO/IBU solid dispersions and solid dispersions containing a partially crystalline plasticizer in the case of E-EPO/IBU/COM extrudates. Interactions between the components of the extrudate were also studied using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR). The occurrence of such interactions in the studied system, which improve the stability of the obtained solid polymer dispersions, was confirmed.

In this study, blend fibers of polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) at various compositions were electrospun from 10 wt% of polymer solutions to encapsulate a model drug of ibuprofen (IBP). The results showed that the average polymer solution viscosities determined the electrospinning parameters and the resulting average fiber diameters. Increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers decreased the average elastic moduli, the average tensile strength, and the average fracture strains, where IBP exhibited a plasticizing effect in the blend PCL/PEO fibers. Increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers promoted the surface wettability of the fibers. The in vitro release of IBP suggested a transition from a gradual release to a fast release when increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers up to 120 min. The in vitro viability of blend PCL/PEO fibers using MTT assays showed that the fibers were compatible with MEF-3T3 fibroblasts.

Multilayer coatings consisting of cellulose acetate (CA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and chitosan (CHI), with or without ibuprofen (Ibu) content, were applied onto medical-grade stainless steel (SS-316 type) through electrospinning, electrospray, or blow spinning. The adhesion of the CA, PCL, and layered CA/PCL membranes, with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 100 μm, to SS substrates varied between 0.15 N and 0.22 N without CHI, which increased to 0.21 and 0.74 N, respectively, when a CHI interlayer was introduced by electrospraying between the SS and the coatings. Although drug release in a simulated body fluid (SBF) medium is predominantly governed by diffusion-driven mechanisms in all single- and multilayer coatings, a delayed release was noted in CA coatings containing Ibu when overlaid with a PCL coating produced by blow spinning.

However, the response of these devices to potentially interfering nutritional, pharmaceutical, or endogenous substances is barely explored. We previously developed an in vitro test method for continuous and dynamic CGM interference testing and herein explore the sensitivity of the Abbott Libre2 (L2) and Dexcom G6 (G6) sensors to a panel of 68 individual substances.<h4>Methods</h4>In each interference experiment, L2 and G6 sensors were exposed in triplicate to substance gradients from zero to supraphysiological concentrations at a stable glucose concentration of 200 mg/dL. YSI Stat 2300 Plus was used as the glucose reference method. Interference was presumed if the CGM sensors showed a mean bias of at least ±10% from baseline with a tested substance at any given substance concentration.<h4>Results</h4>Both L2 and G6 sensors showed interference with the following substances: dithiothreitol (maximal bias from baseline: L2/G6: +46%/-18%), galactose (>+100%/+17%), mannose (>+100%/+20%), and N-acetyl-cysteine (+11%/+18%). The following substances were found to interfere with L2 sensors only: ascorbic acid (+48%), ibuprofen (+14%), icodextrin (+10%), methyldopa (+16%), red wine (+12%), and xylose (>+100%). On the other hand, the following substances were found to interfere with G6 sensors only: acetaminophen (>+100%), ethyl alcohol (+12%), gentisic acid (+18%), hydroxyurea (>+100%), l-cysteine (-25%), l-Dopa (+11%), and uric acid (+33%). Additionally, G6 sensors could subsequently not be calibrated for use after exposure to dithiothreitol, gentisic acid, l-cysteine, and mesalazine (sensor fouling).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our standardized dynamic interference testing protocol identified several nutritional, pharmaceutical and endogenous substances that substantially influenced L2 and G6 sensor signals.

Modern toxicology methods attempt to deduce a mechanistic understanding of pathways involved in the development of toxicity, by using transcriptomics and other big data-driven methods such as high-content screening. Here, we used a recently described optimised method to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), to assess their potential to classify hepatotoxic and non-hepatotoxic chemicals and their use in mechanistic toxicity studies. The iPSC-HLCs could accurately classify chemicals causing acute hepatocellular injury, and the transcriptomics data on treated HLCs obtained by TempO-Seq technology linked the cytotoxicity to cellular stress pathways, including oxidative stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Induction of these stress pathways in response to amiodarone, diclofenac, and ibuprofen, was demonstrated to be concentration and time dependent. The transcriptomics data on diclofenac-treated HLCs were found to be more sensitive in detecting differentially expressed genes in response to treatment, as compared to existing datasets of other diclofenac-treated in vitro hepatocyte models.

It has been postulated and shown in adults that MIS may occur after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (MIS-V). Our current case is one of the first published cases with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in an 18-year-old adolescent after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from Pfizer/BionTech (BNT162b2), who fulfills the published level 1 criteria for a definitive disease: age < 21 years, fever > 3 consecutive days, pericardial effusion, elevated CRP/NT-BNP/Troponin T/D-dimeres, cardiac involvement, and positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The disease starts 10 weeks after the second vaccination, with a fever (up to 40 °C) and was treated with amoxicillin for suspected pneumonia. The SARS CoV-2-PCR and several antigen tests were negative. With an ongoing fever, he was hospitalized 14 days later. A pericardial effusion (10 mm) was diagnosed by echocardiography. The C-reactive protein (174 mg/L), NT-BNP (280 pg/mL), and Troponin T (28 pg/mL) values were elevated. Due to highly elevated D-dimeres (>35,000 μg/L), a pulmonary embolism was excluded by thoracal computer tomography. If the boy did not improve with intravenous antibiotics, he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins; however, the therapy was discontinued after 230 mg/kg if he developed high fever and hypotension. A further specialized clinic treated him with colchicine and ibuprofen. The MIS-V was discovered late, 4 months after the onset of the disease. As recently shown in four children with MIS-C after SARS-CoV-2 infection and a girl with Hashimoto thyroiditis after BNT162b2 vaccination, we found elevated functional autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors that may be important for pathophysiology but are not conclusive for the diagnosis of MIS-C. Conclusion: We are aware that a misattribution of MIS-V as a severe complication of coronavirus vaccination can lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and blunt the global COVID-19 vaccination drive. However, the pediatric population is at a higher risk for MIS-C and a very low risk for COVID-19 mortality.

These drugs inhibit the synthesis and release of prostaglandins （PGs） in the neurons of the anterior hypothalamus and exert therapeutic effects as a consequence. However， these drugs are relatively commonly misused and abused， often owing to a lack of proper medication guidance. As a result， these drugs enter the environment via various pathways， including wastewater treatment plants， agricultural runoff， and improper disposal， thereby posing potential threats to human health and ecosystems. The presence of these contaminants in surface water has become an environmental safety concern that necessitates the development of rapid， accurate， and high-throughput analysis methods. In this study， an analytical method was established for the determination of five antipyretic analgesics （ibuprofen， aminophenazone， antipyrine， phenacetin， and naproxen）. The developed method is based on online solid phase extraction coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry （online SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS）， which provides a high degree of automation and efficiency. Water samples were collected and filtered through 0.2-μm regenerated cellulose （RC） filter membranes， after which Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA and an internal standard were added. An aliquot （0.9 mL） of each sample was injected into the online SPE system using an automatic sampler. Samples were first adsorbed on a PLRP-S online SPE column， washed with 0.05% formic acid aqueous solution， and finally gradient-eluted with a mobile phase composed of 0.2 mmol/L ammonium fluoride solution and methanol-acetonitrile （1∶1， v/v）. Analytes were separated on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column， detected by multiple reaction monitoring with electrospray ionization in both positive- and negative-ion modes， and quantified using the internal-standard method.The five antipyretic analgesics were effectively separated under the optimized experimental conditions and showed good linearities within their respective concentration ranges， with correlation coefficients （<i>r</i>） greater than 0.998. The method detection limits （MDLs） ranged from 0.05 to 0.20 ng/L， and the method quantification limits （MQLs） ranged from 0.20 to 0.80 ng/L. The five antipyretic analgesics exhibited average recoveries of between 64.2% and 112%， with relative standard deviations （RSDs， <i>n</i>=6） of 2.06%-8.99% at low， medium， and high spiked levels. Furthermore， the method was successfully used to analyze water samples from the Hangzhou section of the Qiantang River， in which four target compounds were detected， with antipyrine found to have the highest mass concentration. This newly developed method features a high degree of automation， facilitates the injection of large volumes， and enables online enrichment， purification， and quantitative analysis in an integrated process， with minimal operational errors， high repeatability， and high sensitivity. The developed method shortens sample-analysis times， is more cost-effective， and meets the needs of large-scale sample testing， as it requires only 15 min to completely determine a sample， thereby significantly improving detection efficiency. Overall， the method features low detection limits， analyzes rapidly， and is easy to operate； hence it is suitable for rapid risk screening and the quantitative determination of antipyretic analgesics in surface water.,2025,,"He P, Wang LQ, Zhou S, Zhang BF, Jia X, Chi Y, Xu ZQ, Tang W.",https://doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1123.2024.10018,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"[""Details on ibuprofen's properties"", 'Information on permeation methods', 'Data on permeability rates']","The study focuses on the detection and analysis of ibuprofen in water rather than its in vitro permeation or formulation in diffusion cells.

The covalent linkage of Phe-Phe and NSAIDs results in conjugates that self-assemble in water to form molecular nanofibers as the matrices of hydrogels. When the NSAID is naproxen (1), the resultant hydrogelator 1a forms a hydrogel at a critical concentration (cgc) of 0.2 wt % at pH 7.0. Hydrogelator 1a, also acting as a general motif, enables enzymatic hydrogelation in which the precursor turns into a hydrogelator upon hydrolysis catalyzed by a phosphatase at physiological conditions. The conjugates of Phe-Phe with other NSAIDs, such as (R)-flurbiprofen (2), racemic flurbiprofen (3), and racemic ibuprofen (4), are able to form molecular hydrogels, except in the case of aspirin (5). After the conjugation with the small peptides, NSAIDs exhibit improved selectivity to their targets. In addition, the peptides made of D-amino acids help preserve the activities of NSAIDs.

ZDF rats were hyperglycemic, dyslipidemic and expressed proinflammatory markers in contrast to lean controls, thus reflecting the relationship between obesity and chronic inflammation promoting T2D. Chronic treatment with ibuprofen (2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid) was used to study the impact on pathological T2D conditions as compared to metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide) treated ZDF as well as lean controls. Ibuprofen decreased A1c but induced a high insulin release with improved glucose tolerance only after early time points (i.g., 15 and 30 min) resulting in a non-significant decline of AUC values and translating into a high HOMA-IR. In addition, ibuprofen significantly lowered cholesterol, free fatty acids and HDL-C. Some of these effects by ibuprofen might be based on its anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of cytokine/chemokine signaling (i.g., COX-2, ICAM-1 and TNF-α) as measured in whole blood and epididymal adipose tissue by TaqMan and/or upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.g., IL-4 and IL-13) by ELISA analysis in blood.

However, the efficient delivery of NO donors to tumors remains challenging. The present study used ibuprofen, which has a high binding affinity to human serum albumin (HSA). A total of two types of nitrated forms of ibuprofen, 4-[(nitrooxy)methyl]benzyl 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoate [nitrated ibuprofen benzyl linker (NIB)] and 2-(nitrooxy)ethyl 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propanoate [nitrated ibuprofen ethyl linker (NIE)], were synthesized. It was demonstrated that both NIB and NIE bound to the ibuprofen-binding site of HSA. Although NOx release was observed from NIB, but not NIE, intracellular NO release was detected from both NIB and NIE, which indicated that the mechanisms of NO release may be different for NIB and NIE. Both NIB and NIE induced concentration- and time-dependent cell death in human pancreatic cancer cells, whereas this cell death was not observed with ibuprofen, which could suggest that these cell death-inducing effects may be mediated by NO. The non-specific caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, inhibited cell death induced by NIB and NIE, but activation of caspase 3/7 was not observed. These results suggested that both NIB and NIE induced cell death through a non-caspase 3/7 pathway.

Modification of existing NSAIDs has improved on the chemopreventive efficacy of this agent and reduced its toxicity. In this study, ibuprofen and a modified derivative (phospho-modified ibuprofen or p-ibuprofen) were used in a chemically induced model of colon cancer. Fisher 344 rats were injected with azoxymethane then treated with either ibuprofen (500 ppm) or p-ibuprofen (900 ppm) for 20 weeks to observe aberrant crypt foci (ACF) or 40 weeks to evaluate tumor incidence and multiplicity. β-catenin and p65 were measured in colonic tissues by immunofluorescence staining.

The survival rate of children with unfavorable neuroblastoma remains low among all childhood cancers. MYCN and MYC play a crucial role in determining the malignancy of unfavorable neuroblastomas, whereas high-level expression of the favorable neuroblastoma genes is associated with a good disease outcome and confers growth suppression of neuroblastoma cells. A small fraction of neuroblastomas harbors TP53 mutations at diagnosis, but a higher proportion of the relapse cases acquire TP53 mutations.

Proliferation of cultured human skin fibroblasts was estimated by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell count at increasing concentrations (0.1 nM to 0.1 microM) of LTC4 or LTD4. LTC4 and LTD4 stimulated cell growth in a dose-dependent manner only in the presence of 50 microM indomethacin. Under similar conditions, LTE4 but not LTB4 (0.1 microM) was active. Both asynchronous, growing cells and synchronous, quiescent cells were sensitive to LT when prostaglandin (PG) synthesis was suppressed by indomethacin. Other blockers of cyclooxygenase such as ibuprofen and aspirin exhibited identical permissive activity, and the effect of indomethacin was totally abolished by addition of PGE2. LTC4 modified neither [3H]arachidonic acid release from prelabeled fibroblasts nor PGE2 production by fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that the sulfidopeptide LT stimulate fibroblast proliferation only when the endogenous synthesis of PG is blocked, but they do not enhance the synthesis of PG in their target cells showing no evidence for a negative feed-back loop.

The recent discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of lethal sepsis has prompted investigation for development of new experimental therapeutics. We found that many steroidal drugs (such as dexamethasone and cortisone) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin) failed to influence endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release even at superpharmacological concentrations (up to 10-25 microM). However, several steroid-like pigments (tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, and cryptotanshinone) of a popular Chinese herb, Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), dose dependently attenuated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 release in macrophage/monocyte cultures. A water-soluble tanshinone IIA sodium sulfonate derivative (TSNIIA-SS), which has been widely used as a Chinese medicine for patients with cardiovascular disorders, selectively abrogated endotoxin-induced HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation and release in a glucocorticoid receptor-independent manner. Administration of TSNIIA-SS significantly protected mice against lethal endotoxemia and rescued mice from lethal sepsis even when the first dose was given 24 h after the onset of sepsis. The therapeutic effects were partly attributable to attenuation of systemic accumulation of HMGB1 (but not TNF and NO) and improvement of cardiovascular physiologic parameters (e.g., decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance and increase in cardiac stroke volume) in septic animals.

The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams for microemulsion regions were constructed using oleic acid as the oil, Tween 80 as the surfactant and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as the cosurfactant. Various microemulsion formulations were prepared and optimized by 3(2) factorial design on the basis of percentage (%) transmittance, globule size, zeta potential, drug release, and skin permeability. The abilities of various microemulsions to deliver bifonazole through the skin were evaluated ex vivo using Franz diffusion cells fitted with rat skins. The Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose (HPMC) K100 M as a gel matrix was used to construct the microemulsion-based hydrogel for improving the viscosity of microemulsion for topical administration. The optimized microemulsion-based hydrogel was evaluated for viscosity, spreadability, skin irritancy, skin permeability, stability, and antifungal activity by comparing it with marketed bifonazole cream.<h4>Results</h4>The mechanism of drug release from microemulsion-based hydrogel was observed to follow zero order kinetics. The studied optimized microemulsion-based hydrogel showed a good stability over the period of 3 months. Average globule size of optimized microemulsion (F5) was found to be 18.98 nm, zeta potential was found to be -5.56 mv, and permeability of drug from microemulsion within 8 h was observed 84%. The antifungal activity of microemulsion-based hydrogel was found to be comparable with marketed cream.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results indicate that the studied microemulsion-based hydrogel (F5) has a potential for sustained action of drug release and it may act as promising vehicle for topical delivery of ibuprofen.",2012,,"Sabale V, Vora S.",https://doi.org/10.4103/2230-973X.104397,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['formulation details of microemulsion-based hydrogel', 'specific data on ibuprofen if mentioned', 'detailed permeability results', 'methods for stability and skin irritancy testing']","The study focuses on skin permeability using Franz diffusion cells but does not mention ibuprofen specifically.

MBG structure and morphology, as well as mesopores size and shape, were investigated by x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. In vitro bioactivity was investigated by soaking MBG membranes in simulated body fluid (SBF) for different time frames. Ibuprofen was encapsulated into MBG pores and drug release kinetics in SBF were assessed. Biological tests by using SAOS-2 cells were performed to assess the material cytocompatibility.<h4>Results</h4>The material revealed significant ability to induce hydroxyapatite formation on its surface (bioactivity). Drug release kinetics in SBF are very similar to those obtained for mesoporous silica having mesopore size comparable to that of the prepared MBG (∼5 nm). No evidence of cell viability depression was detected during in vitro culture, which demonstrates the good biological compatibility of the material.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The easiness of tailoring and shaping, the highly bioactive and biocompatible behavior, and the drug uptake/release ability of the prepared materials may suggest their use as ""smart"" multifunctional grafts for bone reconstructive surgery.",2012,,"Baino F, Fiorilli S, Mortera R, Onida B, Saino E, Visai L, Verné E, Vitale-Brovarone C.",https://doi.org/10.5301/JABFM.2012.9270,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Drug release kinetics', 'Encapsulation method of ibuprofen', 'Cytocompatibility results']","The study involves ibuprofen release from bioactive glass membranes, indicating relevance to in vitro permeation.

Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue that can lead to the release of muscle fiber contents into the bloodstream. This can cause serious damage to the kidneys, leading to AKI. In this case, a young bodybuilder was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis induced by AKI after consuming Ibuprofen for a casual fever. The etiology of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is complex, with multiple factors contributing to the development of the condition. These include muscle trauma, dehydration, infection, and drug toxicity. In this case, Ibuprofen may have contributed to the development of AKI, as it can cause kidney damage when taken in large doses. Additionally, the bodybuilder's physical activity may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis, as intense exercise can cause muscle damage. Treatment for AKI in rhabdomyolysis patients typically involves aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, and dialysis if necessary. Additionally, the underlying cause of the rhabdomyolysis must be identified and treated. In this case, the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of kidney damage, and the Ibuprofen should be discontinued. In conclusion, this is a case of a relatively common presentation with uncommon circumstances.

MED,40909037,40909037.0,10.7759/cureus.89368,Drug-Induced Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis: A Case Report.,"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, life-threatening mucocutaneous condition, most commonly triggered by drugs, with particularly high mortality in elderly populations. The medications most frequently associated with TEN include antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sulfonamides), penicillins, cephalosporins, and quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin); anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially oxicam derivatives (e.g., piroxicam), and, less commonly, ibuprofen; allopurinol; nevirapine; and other agents such as paracetamol, celecoxib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immunobiological therapies like infliximab. We describe a 71-year-old, functionally dependent male who developed fever and progressive skin detachment after self-medicating with paracetamol and ibuprofen. Examination revealed widespread bullae and skin sloughing involving approximately 70% of his total body surface area (TBSA). Despite supportive measures, the patient rapidly deteriorated and died on the second day of hospitalization. TEN was assumed as the primary cause of death. The prognosis in TEN is strongly influenced by age, comorbidities, and the extent of skin involvement. Genetic predispositions, such as HLA-B<i>15:02</i> (associated with carbamazepine-induced TEN, particularly in Southeast Asian populations), HLA-A31:01 (carbamazepine hypersensitivity in European, Japanese, and Latin American populations), and HLA-B*58:01 (allopurinol-induced TEN in Asian populations), are important risk factors that guide genetic screening recommendations before prescribing certain high-risk drugs. Supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment for TEN, focusing on meticulous wound care, fluid and electrolyte management, infection prevention, and pain control. However, the use of immunomodulatory therapies, such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and biologics, remains a subject of ongoing debate, with inconsistent evidence regarding their efficacy. Timely recognition of TEN and immediate cessation of the offending drug are paramount to improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality. This case highlights the potential role of ibuprofen, a commonly used over-the-counter NSAID, as a trigger for TEN, particularly in frail elderly individuals. Although ibuprofen is generally considered a low-risk medication, its capacity to induce severe cutaneous adverse reactions should not be underestimated. The prognosis in TEN is heavily influenced by factors such as advanced age, existing comorbidities, and the extent of skin involvement. Given the high fatality rates associated with TEN, especially in older adults, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with acute mucocutaneous symptoms following recent drug exposure, including over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen, and emphasize the importance of public education on the dangers of unsupervised self-medication.",2025,,"Pereira da Silva T, Santos ML, Brito AP, Fernandes M, Cotter J.",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.89368,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",park,no,uncertain,no,no,uncertain,"['Relevance to in vitro permeation', 'Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Any diffusion cell methodologies', 'Endpoints measured in relation to ibuprofen']","This case report on toxic epidermal necrolysis does not focus on ibuprofen permeation or release studies, making it likely irrelevant for the dataset.",0.7
