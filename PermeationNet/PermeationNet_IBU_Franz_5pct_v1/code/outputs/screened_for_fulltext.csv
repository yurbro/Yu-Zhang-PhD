Incubation of ibuprofen with rat skin homogenates in the presence of coenzyme A, ATP, and magnesium provided no evidence for the formation of ibuprofenyl coenzyme A (the initial intermediate in the metabolic inversion of [R]- to [S]-ibuprofen). Similar incubation studies gave no indication of a change in the enantiomeric ratios of ibuprofen over the time course of the experiments. Percutaneous penetration studies of ibuprofen gel through porcine skin indicated that the ibuprofen enantiomer levels in the reservoir solutions were consistent with racemic ibuprofen having traversed the skin with no metabolic inversion.

The main treatments are compression bandages and dressings. As these ulcers are often painful some clinicians choose particular dressings and topical treatments (analgesia/ local anaesthetic) to reduce the pain both during and between dressing changes.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effectiveness of dressings, local anaesthetics or topical analgesia for pain relief in venous leg ulceration.<h4>Search strategy</h4>For this update the search strings were revised and the following databases were searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 16/12/09) The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2009; Ovid MEDLINE - 1950 to November Week 3 2009; Ovid EMBASE - 1980 to 2009 Week 50; EBSCO CINAHL - 1982 to December 16 2009. No date or language restrictions were applied.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Randomised controlled trials which evaluated local interventions used to relieve venous leg ulcer pain were considered. Pain was defined as either persistent pain or pain at dressing changes or debridement. Ulcer healing and reported adverse events were also considered as further outcomes.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Eligibility for inclusion was confirmed by two review authors who independently assessed the potential trials.<h4>Main results</h4>Two trials evaluating interventions for persistent venous leg ulcer pain were identified for this review update. Both studies evaluated ibuprofen slow release foam dressings; one comparing it with local best practice and the other with an identical foam comparator. The primary end point for both studies was ""pain relief achieved"". When compared with a foam dressing alone, there was no evidence of a statistically significant effect of the ibuprofen foam dressing in terms of achieving some pain relief the first evening after treatment: 74% in the ibuprofen group (46/62) had pain relief compared with 58% (35/60) in the foam group (no significant difference: RR 1.27, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.65). In the second study 100% (32/32) of people with venous ulcers achieved some pain relief with the ibuprofen dressing on the first evening of treatment compared with 93% (26/28) in the local best practice group (no significant difference: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21). Pooling these studies in a meta-analysis (using a random effects model as significant heterogeneity present (p=0.1), I(2) = 64%) there is no evidence that ibuprofen dressings increase the pain relief experienced by the first evening of use (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44). We were not able to extract sufficient data to combine other pain outcomes from these trials. There was no difference in healing rates but slightly more adverse events with ibuprofen dressings than with a similar foam dressing without ibuprofen.Six trials evaluated interventions for the pain associated with debridement and were considered sufficiently similar to pool. There was a statistically significant reduction in debridement pain scores with 5% Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream; the difference in means (measured on a 100 mm scale) was 20.6 mm (95% CI 12.19 to 29.11). Of these six trials, only one small trial measured healing as an outcome and found no difference in the numbers of ulcers healed at the end of the study.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is no evidence that ibuprofen dressings offer pain relief, as measured at the first evening of use, to people with painful venous leg ulcers compared with foam dressings or best practice.EMLA appears to provide effective pain relief for venous leg ulcer debridement but the effect (if any) of EMLA on ulcer healing remains unknown.",2010,,"Briggs M, Nelson EA.",https://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/499/1/Topical%20agents%20or%20dressings%20for%20pain%20in%20venous%20leg%20ulcers.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Data on in vitro permeation', 'Methods for assessing permeation', 'Results related to ibuprofen release metrics']","The study evaluates ibuprofen foam dressings in venous leg ulcers, indicating a focus on formulation and measurable endpoints related to drug release and effect.

The main treatments are compression bandages and dressings. Topical treatments to reduce pain during and between dressing changes are sometimes used.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the effects of topical agents or dressings for pain in venous leg ulcers.<h4>Search methods</h4>For this third update the following databases were searched: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 9 May 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (2009 to April Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations May 08, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2009 to 2012 Week 18); and EBSCO CINAHL (2009 to May 2 2012). No date or language restrictions were applied.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of topical agents or dressing for the treatment of pain in venous ulcers were included.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently performed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment.<h4>Main results</h4>Six trials (343 participants) evaluated Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream for the pain associated with ulcer debridement. The between-group difference in pain measured on a 100 mm scale was statistically significant in favour of EMLA (MD -20.65, 95% CI -12.19 to -29.11). No significant between-group differences in burning or itching were observed.Two trials (470 participants with venous leg ulcers) evaluated ibuprofen slow-release foam dressings for persistent venous leg ulcer pain. Compared with local best practice, significantly more participants in the ibuprofen dressing group achieved the outcome of >50% of the total maximum pain relief score between day 1 and day 5 than participants in the local best practice group (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.15). The number needed to treat was 6 (95% CI 4 to 12). In the second trial, compared with an identical non-ibuprofen foam dressing, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing slight to complete pain relief on the first evening of treatment.Limited data were available to assess healing rates or adverse events.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. EMLA (5%) appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers.

Thus, this work reports on the production, characterization, and release kinetics of a poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) microporous membrane containing a zeolite (Faujasite) and a magnetic stimuli-sensitive component, magnetostrictive Terfenol-D (TD), for the release of ibuprofen (IBU) as drug model. For membranes containing IBU-loaded zeolites and TD without an applied AC magnetic field, the release kinetics is characterized by a first order release. On the other hand, the application of an AC magnetic field modifies the release profile of the membrane, leading to an increase of the release rate by more than 30%, the magnetically driven release being characterized by a super case-II within the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, indicating a release mainly driven by a swelling or erosion mechanism, induced by the magnetostrictive particles under the applied magnetic field. The increase of the TD w/w from 10% to 20% has as a consequence a decrease in the quantity of IBU released from 79% to 70%; on the contrary, increasing the H <sub>AC</sub> intensity from 100 to 200 mT promotes an increase on the percentage of IBU released from 67% to 75%.",2016,,"Barbosa J, Correia DM, Gonçalves R, Ribeiro C, Botelho G, Martins P, Lanceros-Mendez S.",https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.201600591,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on the diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics of the magnetically controlled release mechanism', 'Characterization methods for the PLLA membrane', 'Full release kinetics data', 'Comparative analysis without magnetic field']","This study focuses on the release kinetics of ibuprofen using a specially designed membrane in a magnetically controlled system, which is relevant for the PermeationNet dataset.",0.9
MED,18985797,18985797.0,10.1002/bdd.631,Skin disposition of menthol after its application in the presence of drug substances.,"Many drug products that are applied onto the skin contain menthol. Menthol plays a dual role in the analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs: it causes cooling and local anesthetic effects and, being a penetration enhancer, it increases the skin permeation of the drug substances. However, there are no data concerning the skin penetration of menthol after its application in the most commonly used vehicles and in the presence of drug substances. Therefore, this study evaluated the ex vivo skin disposition of menthol after application of the commercially available drug products containing aluminum acetotartrate, methyl salicylate, ibuprofen and naproxen, using full human-skin mounted in flow-through diffusion cells. After 15, 30 and 60 min of application, the skin was progressively tape-stripped into three fractions of stratum corneum and the remaining epidermis with dermis. The content of menthol in the skin layers was determined by GC method. Varying degrees of penetration of menthol into the skin layers was observed, depending on its amount in the vehicle and the presence of drug substance. In the presence of aluminum acetotartrate, the skin penetration of menthol was limited only to the outer fraction of the stratum corneum. In the case of drug products containing naproxen, the concentration of the drug substance significantly influenced the skin penetration of menthol.",2008,,Cal K.,https://doi.org/10.1002/bdd.631,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Quantitative results for skin penetration of menthol', 'Comparison of drug product vehicles', 'Methods used for skin disposition analysis']","The study directly involves skin permeation analysis using diffusion cells and includes ibuprofen as one of the drug substances, making it highly relevant for the dataset.",0.9

The effects of the mobile phase composition, concentration of HP-beta-CD and column temperature on retention and enantioselective separation were investigated. With 2-APA NSAIDs as acidic analytes, the retention times and resolutions of the enantiomers were strongly related to the pH of the mobile phase. In addition, both the concentration of HP-beta-CD and temperature had a great effect on retention time, but only a slight or almost no effect on resolutions of the analytes. Enantioseparations were achieved on a Shimpack CLC-ODS (150 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 microm) column. The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 4.0-5.5, 20 mM) containing 25 mM HP-beta-CD.

A well-studied gel-inducing supramolecular synthon, namely primary ammonium monocarboxylate (PAM), has been exploited to generate a series of PAM salts by reacting ibuprofen with various primary amines. Remarkably, all of the salts (S1-S7) thus synthesized proved to be good to moderate gelators of various polar and nonpolar solvents. Single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction studies established the existence of the PAM synthons in the gel network, confirming the efficacy of the supramolecular synthon approach employed. Most importantly, the majority of the salts (S2, S3, S6, and S7) were capable of gelling methyl salicylate (MS), an important ingredient found in many commercial topical gels. In vitro experiments (MTT and PGE2 assays) revealed that all of the salts (except S3 and S7) were biocompatible (up to 0.5 mm concentration), and the most suited one, S6, displayed anti-inflammatory ability as good as that of the parent drug ibuprofen. A topical gel of S6 with methyl salicylate and menthol was found to be suitable for delivering the gelator drug in a self-delivery fashion in treating skin inflammation in mice. Histological studies, including immunohistology, were performed to further probe the role of the gelator drug S6 in treating inflammation.

Baseline transdermal kinetics in adult aquatic and arboreal frog species have recently been reported; however, there is little information regarding absorption kinetics in adult terrestrial species. The present study investigated the in vitro absorption kinetics of 3 model chemicals-caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen-through different skin regions in the terrestrial toad Rhinella marina. Caffeine flux was consistently higher than that of the other 2 chemicals (p < 0.001), whereas the fluxes of the moderately and highly lipophilic chemicals (benzoic acid and ibuprofen) were similar, regardless of skin region. When considering individual chemicals, caffeine demonstrated increased flux through the ventral pelvic skin compared with the ventral thoracic or dorsal skin regions. Flux did not differ between skin regions for either benzoic acid or ibuprofen. These findings have implications for management of environmental contamination in frog habitats, as many environmental xenobiotics are of moderate to high lipophilicity and would be expected to be equally absorbed from all skin surfaces in terrestrial toads.

Most of these models cater only to a phase of drug release from a constant reservoir. All these models, however, are not applicable to drug release from biodegradable triple-layered microparticle system, in which the drug-loaded core (reservoir) is surrounded by nondrug holding outer layers (membrane). In this article, a mathematical model was developed for ibuprofen release from degradable triple-layered microparticles made of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide, 50:50) (PLGA), poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate, 40 wt % vinyl acetate) (EVA), where ibuprofen was localized within the nonconstant reservoir (EVA core). The model postulated that the drug release through the bulk-degrading PLLA and PLGA layers consisted of two mechanisms: simple diffusional release followed by a degradation-controlled release through a rate-limiting membrane. The proposed model showed very good match with the experimental data of release from microparticles of various layer thicknesses and particle sizes. The underlying drug release mechanisms are dictated by three parameters determined by the model, including constant characteristic of diffusion, end time point of simple diffusion-controlled release and partition coefficient of drug.

The deliverable dose of powder exiting the device is approximately 50% of the total cassette loading; the rest is lost via a gap forced open between the injector base and the surface of the target gel. It could be shown that substantial comminution of two different ibuprofen particle size fraction (38-53 microm, 53-75 microm) occurs within the injector on actuation. This resulted in an equiparation of the two initially different size fractions. Reduced comminution occurs with an ibuprofen/PVP (95:5) particulate formed by spray-drying/compaction/milling. On actuation into excised human skin membranes approximately 37% of cassette dose is recovered from the stratum corneum by stripping, and only 3% from the epidermis. It is concluded that powder delivery is mainly intra-epidermal with few particles fully breaching the stratum corneum. This is a consequence of the relative magnitude of the particle diameter (approximately 48 microm) and the stratum corneum thickness (approximately 10 microm). A 'soft' polyethylene glycol monolayer target gel gives the closest total percentage recovery of powder to that seen with the excised human skin membranes.

The influence of these properties on transdermal formulation development, especially the relative effect of lowered melting point, on skin permeation must be carefully assessed to provide the most efficacious formulation. Thermodynamic properties and crystalline structures of the enantiomers, eutectics, and racemate of chiral ibuprofen were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. The effect of melting point lowering on membrane permeation rates was mathematically modeled. Model was validated by in vitro skin permeation experiments using different preparations of racemic ibuprofen, enantiomer, and eutectic. Both enantiomer and eutectic formed a two-phase liquid system containing an emulsifiable aqueous phase and an oily phase in the presence of aqueous isopropyl alcohol (aIPA). The eutectic emulsion had the highest permeation rate, a 2.21-fold increase in flux compared with saturated aIPA solutions of the racemate with a 2.03-fold increase in flux. Results from the two-phase liquid system supported those from the mathematical models, albeit somewhat lower, and confirmed their use in predicting maximum flux utilizing thermodynamic data.

The work is based on our previous results that, in particular, extend the well-known Higuchi model. Recently, we have introduced a numerical transient model describing matrix systems where the drug dissolution can be non-instantaneous. Furthermore, our model can describe complex interactions within a multi-layered matrix and the matrix to skin boundary. The power of the modelling approach presented here is further illustrated by allowing the possibility of a donor solution.

In vitro permeability experiments were performed in side-by-side diffusion cells with diclofenac, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen and human skin. The donor solution pH significantly affected skin permeation of NSAIDs, whereas no effect of the receiver pH was observed. Similar to previous observations, the apparent permeability coefficient versus donor solution pH relationships deviated from the predictions (fractions of unionized NSAIDs) according to the acid/base theory. The influences of the viable epidermis barrier, polar pathway transport, ion permeation across skin, and effective skin pH were investigated. The effective pH values for skin permeation determined using the NSAIDs (weak acids) in this study were different from those obtained previously with a weak base at the same donor solution pH conditions, suggesting that the observed permeability-pH relationships could not be explained solely by possible pH differences between skin and donor solution.",2015,,"Chantasart D, Chootanasoontorn S, Suksiriworapong J, Li SK.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.24556,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,no,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific data on permeation coefficients', 'Methodology of permeability experiments']","This study focuses on in vitro skin permeation of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, emphasizing relevant experimental conditions and measurable outcomes.",0.9

Commercially available cattle intestine natural membranes (NM), polyethersulfone (PES), and regenerated cellulose-based (RC) flat membranes (nominal cut-off 1 kDa) have been investigated as ultrafiltration membranes in a small tangential-flow ultrafiltration unit (TF-UF). First, the nominal cut-off of the NM membranes under study was assessed at approximately 5 kDa, by using polystyrenesulfonate standards for pore-size classification at low TF-UF pressure (0.25 x 10(5) Pa). Working pressures of >1.5 x 10(5) Pa strongly increased the cut-off of NM, in contrast with that of PES and RC membranes. Sulfa, Carba, Diclo and Ibu (1 mg L(-1) each) in colloid-free aqueous solutions (400 mg L(-1) NaCl) completely permeated through NM membranes, but less through PES and RC, which had particular sorption capability towards Diclo. The drugs were routinely determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Detailed TF-UF investigation of drug retention on NM in the presence of humic hydrocolloids revealed strong interactions between aquatic humic substances (HS) and Diclo and Ibu (but not with Sulfa and Carba) causing retention of up to 80% of Diclo and Ibu, probably because of their binding to macromolecular HS. The standard deviation (SD) of both drug and HS permeation through a single NM was between 2.5 (Sulfa) and 4.0% (Diclo), in contrast with the SD of permeation through separate membranes taken from different lots [SD up to 14.0% (Diclo)], presumably caused by natural variation of the studied NM. Accordingly, membrane filtration of drug-containing water samples on cattle intestines enables both analyte/matrix separations for Carba and Sulfa in the presence of humic colloids and analytical discrimination between free and colloid-bound Diclo and Ibu fractions.",2005,,"Burba P, Geltenpoth H, Nolte J.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-005-3296-z,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",later,no,uncertain,yes,no,uncertain,"['Specifics on ibuprofen permeation rates', 'Details on methodologies used for diffusion cell setup', 'Comparative analysis between different membranes regarding ibuprofen', 'Effect of humic substances on ibuprofen retention']",The study involves ibuprofen's behavior on membranes but lacks explicit focus on diffusion cells.

The strong bonding results from Michael type addition reaction between an acrylate end group on a polymer and the sulfide end group of the mucin type glycoprotein. A proof of concept is provided using a polyehtylene glycol hydrogel formed in situ from polyehtylene glycol di-acrylate (PEG-DA) macromers. The ability of PEG-DA to create interactions with mucin type glycoproteins was verified using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and rheology experiments. NMR studies have detected disappearance of the PEG-DA's vinyl protons upon mucin addition, whereas rheology measurements have shown a viscosity increase. These results provide an evidence for the formation of mucin-polymer covalent bond. The ability PEG-DA to attach to mucus and promote mucoadhesion was evaluated by tensile measurements.

Physical status studies suggested that Drug-in-fiber could inhibit IBU re-crystallization, but the active ingredients were released at a relatively slow rate due to the dual-resistance of fiber mat and adhesive matrix. To overcome this shortcoming, Drug-in-adhesive/fiber was designed by coupling medicated hydrophilic pressure sensitive adhesive and IBU-loaded fiber mat. This method endowed Drug-in-adhesive/fiber a fast IBU release rate and high permeated drug amount though simulative skins.

However, this process can introduce pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and their metabolites, posing environmental risks. This study investigates the transport behavior of four selected PhACs-caffeine, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and ibuprofen-under neutral pH conditions using column experiments in both unsaturated and saturated porous media. PhACs and a tracer solution were introduced into the system, and experimental results were simulated using the CXTFIT model to determine retardation and degradation factors. Experimental findings indicate high mobility for carbamazepine and ibuprofen across both unsaturated and saturated conditions with high recovery (> 88%) and negligible degradation (< 0.05). Ibuprofen behaved similarly identical to the tracer in unsaturated medium and with small adsorption/desorption in saturation with a retardation factor of ~ 1, while carbamazepine showed slight retardation and tailing effects showing higher persistence in the water, with high dispersion in unsaturated medium. Diclofenac significantly degrades in saturated media (45% recovery) but increases release under unsaturated conditions (91% recovery). This indicates the release of diclofenac through the vadose zone but can undergo degradation and retardation in aquifers. Caffeine exhibited high retardation and degradation, with a low recovery rate (27-30%) under both conditions, suggesting that degradation or irreversible adsorption may have occurred independently of moisture content during transport. This finding highlights the differences in mobility and degradation across unsaturated and saturated zones, posing long-term contamination risks of PhACs.

Dissolution and permeation studies performed utilizing diffusion cells and subsequently HPLC validated methods were employed to determine the API content in the acceptor solution. Accelerated stability studies were also performed at 40 °C and 70% relative humidity. The adhesive performance of the fabricated patch was evaluated utilizing loop tack adhesion tests.<h4>Results</h4>In vitro permeation experiments across both Strat-M® and human skin demonstrated that ibuprofen can easily be released from the adhesive matrix and penetrate through the studied membrane. A comparison on the permeation rates of the API across the two membranes indicated that there is not a strong correlation between the obtained data. The presence of chemical enhancers facilitated an increased flux of the API higher than observed in the basic formulation. Initial stability studies of the optimized formulation showed no degradation with respect to the drug content. Adhesion studies were also performed indicating higher values when compared with commercially available products.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study demonstrated the fabrication of an ibuprofen patch utilizing a versatile, solvent-free drug delivery platform. Upon optimization of the final system, the resulting patch offers many advantages compared to commercially available formulations including high drug loading (up to 25 wt%), good adhesion, and painless removal leaving no residues on the skin. This PSA offers many advantages over existing adhesive technology.

The aim of this study was to investigate in a systematic way whether miconazole nitrate can have skin penetration enhancing properties. Using Franz diffusion cells, three representative model compounds (caffeine, testosterone and ibuprofen) were applied to human skin as 10 mM aqueous-ethanolic solutions with or without 1 mM of miconazole nitrate. The apparent permeability coefficient K(p) for each of the model compounds was determined with and without miconazole nitrate. While a statistically significant penetration enhancement effect of 33% was found for testosterone, no overall statistically significant effect could be demonstrated for caffeine and ibuprofen. The increase in skin permeability of testosterone is mainly due to an improved partitioning from the dose solution into the skin, thereby resulting in a higher delivery through the human skin.

Microneedles (MN) made from dissolving polymeric matrices and loaded with the model drugs ovalbumin (OVA) and ibuprofen sodium and hydrogel-forming MN composed of ""super-swelling"" polymers and their corresponding lyophilised wafer drug reservoirs loaded with OVA and ibuprofen sodium were prepared aseptically or sterilised using commonly employed sterilisation techniques. Moist and dry heat sterilisation, understandably, damaged all devices, leaving aseptic production and gamma sterilisation as the only viable options. No measureable bioburden was detected in any of the prepared devices, and endotoxin levels were always below the US Food & Drug Administration limits (20 endotoxin units/device). Hydrogel-forming MN were unaffected by gamma irradiation (25 kGy) in terms of their physical properties or capabilities in delivering OVA and ibuprofen sodium across excised neonatal porcine skin in vitro. However, OVA content in dissolving MN (down from approximately 101.1 % recovery to approximately 58.3 % recovery) and lyophilised wafer-type drug reservoirs (down from approximately 99.7 % recovery to approximately 60.1 % recovery) was significantly reduced by gamma irradiation, while the skin permeation profile of ibuprofen sodium from gamma-irradiated dissolving MN was markedly different from their non-irradiated counterparts. It is clear that MN poses a very low risk to human health when used appropriately, as evidenced here by low endotoxin levels and absence of microbial contamination. However, if guarantees of absolute sterility of MN products are ultimately required by regulatory authorities, it will be necessary to investigate the effect of lower gamma doses on dissolving MN loaded with active pharmaceutical ingredients and lyophilised wafers loaded with biomolecules in order to avoid the expense and inconvenience of aseptic processing.",2015,,"McCrudden MT, Alkilani AZ, Courtenay AJ, McCrudden CM, McCloskey B, Walker C, Alshraiedeh N, Lutton RE, Gilmore BF, Woolfson AD, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13346-014-0211-1,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed results on permeation rates of ibuprofen sodium', 'Comparison of different formulations', 'Impact of sterilization methods on drug delivery efficacy']","The study involves ibuprofen sodium and in vitro skin permeation, making it relevant for the dataset.

In this work, a thermo- and pH-responsive hydrogel (P-CHP407) was prepared from an <i>ad hoc</i> synthesized amphiphilic poly(ether urethane) (CHP407) exposing a significant amount of -COOH groups (8.8 ± 0.9 nmol/g<sub>polymer</sub>). The exposure of acid moieties in P-CHP407 hydrogel led to slightly lower initial gelation temperature (12.1 °C <i>vs.</i> 14.6 °C, respectively) and gelation rate than CHP407 hydrogel, as rheologically assessed. Nanoscale hydrogel characterization by Low Field NMR (LF-NMR) spectroscopy suggested that the presence of carboxylic groups in P-CHP407 caused the formation of bigger micelles with a thicker hydrated shell than CHP407 hydrogels, as further proved by Dynamic Light Scattering analyses. In addition, P-CHP407 hydrogel showed improved capability to change its internal pH compared to CHP407 one when incubated with an alkaline buffer (pH 8) (e.g., pH<sub>change_5min</sub> = 3.76 and 1.32, respectively). Moreover, LF-NMR characterization suggested a stronger alkaline-pH-induced interaction of water molecules with micelles exposing -COOH groups.

For kinetic transport of biochemical compounds or drug molecules, the permeability through the phospholipid membranes is a key kinetic property, but long timescales are hindering the accurate computation. Technological advances in high-performance computing therefore need to be accompanied by theoretical and methodological developments. In this contribution, the replica exchange transition interface sampling (RETIS) methodology is shown to give perspective toward observing longer permeation pathways. It is first reviewed how RETIS, a path-sampling methodology that gives in principle exact kinetics, can be used to compute membrane permeability. Next, recent and current developments in three RETIS aspects are discussed: several new Monte Carlo moves in the path-sampling algorithm, memory reduction by reducing pathlengths, and exploitation of parallel computing with CPU-imbalanced replicas. Finally, the memory reduction presenting a new replica exchange implementation, coined REPPTIS, is showcased with a permeant needing to pass a membrane with two permeation channels, either representing an entropic or energetic barrier. The REPPTIS results showed clearly that inclusion of some memory and enhancing ergodic sampling via replica exchange moves are both necessary to obtain correct permeability estimates. In an additional example, ibuprofen permeation through a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine membrane was modeled. REPPTIS succeeded in estimating the permeability of this amphiphilic drug molecule with metastable states along the permeation pathway.

However, topical treatments and drug elution coatings will require uniform films as drug delivery systems. This work studies the use of surface supportive MOF thin films for drug loading and releasing. More specifically, we focus on an iron-containing MOF, MIL-88B(Fe), on a COOH-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modified Au surface for encapsulating ibuprofen as a model drug. A combined experimental and computational approach was employed to study the fabrication of MIL-88B(Fe) film on functionalized Au surfaces. We used several surface characterization techniques, including infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, to confirm the chemical composition and morphological changes of the surface after each modification step. The resulting MIL-88B(Fe) thin film was found capable of loading 8.7 wt% of ibuprofen using quartz crystal microbalance analysis.

At pH=3, the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes: poly(sodium-4-styrene)sulphonate (PSS) and the chitosan (Chit) bind to the positively charged protein via electrostatic interactions. We applied ibuprofen (IBU) as model molecule which has low solubility. The changes in the BSA's secondary structure during the steps of the synthesis were inspected by FT-IR measurements. The size and the zeta potential were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The changes in the structure and in the size were investigated by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) too, for each composite. The release of the ibuprofen was studied by vertical diffusion cell (Franz cell) at pH 7.4 at 25 and 37.5°C. The structure of the core-shell nanoparticles have significantly changed as the pH has risen from 3.0 to 7.4. Kinetic models were used to describe the release mechanism. The experimental results demonstrated that the BSA has an ordered structure at pH=3 which will become random coil by adding ibuprofen. The first shell restores the ordered structure of the protein.

As a consequence of such variability in pH there is a corresponding variability in the degree of ionisation which in turn, could influence permeation through the mainly hydrophobic-rich membrane structure. This study reports the effect of pH on the permeation of five model compounds (benzoic acid, benzotriazole, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and lidocaine). For the five compounds analysed, each at three distinct percentages of ionisation, it was found that the greater extent of permeation was always for the more 'neutral', i.e. more greatly unionised, species rather than the anionic or cationic species. These findings fit with the theory that the hydrophobic membrane encourages permeation of 'lipid-like' structures, i.e. the more unionised form of compounds. However, results obtained with an Inverse Gas Chromatography Surface Energy Analyser (iGC SEA) indicate the membrane surface to be an electron dense environment.

Furthermore drug permeation could be increased by choice of a permeation enhancing formulation. In this study, permeation of ALA and ABE was investigated from various formulations. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) experiments were performed in order to reveal an interaction between the tested formulations and stratum corneum lipid structure. Drug incorporation into Dolgit Mikrogel showed the highest increase in permeability with both ALA and ABE. Especially, ABE together with Dolgit Mikrogel was the most promising combination. Further permeation studies with poloxamer based ABE formulations, partially enriched with ibuprofen acid and medium chained triglycerides showed that both compounds promote permeation. The permeation coefficients of either drug from Excipial Creme and Basiscreme DAC were found to be very similar. These results were in accordance with those of DSC and WAXD experiments. Interaction between formulation and stratum corneum lipid structure resulting in an increased drug permeation only occurred after pretreatment with formulations enriched with ibuprofen acid. After pretreatment with Excipial Creme, Basiscreme DAC or Excipial Fettcreme stratum corneum structure and subsequently permeability remained unchanged.

The stability of the patches, prepared without adding crystallization inhibitors, was unsatisfactory because crystals grew in less than 1 month. Among the low molecular weight molecules, only PG inhibited the IB crystallization up to 50 days without affecting the IB skin permeation profile. The addition of EuE or EuRL in the matrices prevented drug crystallization for more than 12 months.

The degree of swelling of the EMA membranes increased with the ethanol composition and MA content. The contact angle of a sessile drop (10 microL of ethanol/water solution) decreased with an increase in the ethanol fraction suggesting that the membrane wettibility increased with the ethanol content.

Two coagel formulations and the same coagels added of polyethylene glycol (PEG-400) were assayed in comparison with a commercial product (Arfen®) by using hairless rat skin as model. The ASC₁₆ and ASC₁₂ derivatives gave rise to stable supramolecular assemblies in water and in water/PEG mixtures (coagels), allowing the solubilization of IBU (0.85%) and producing a IBU controlled release systems, as evidenced by the dynamic dialyse test: the n values were near 1.0, indicative of a linear kinetic, for all coagel formulations, except for the ASC₁₂PEG/C formulation (n=1.51). Our results evidenced the enhancement activity of coagels and the synergic effect of the combination with PEG: all coagels showed a higher amount of IBU permeated through the skin compared to commercial Arfen® with an enhancement factor of 52.94 and 21.53 for ASC₁₂PEG/C and ASC₁₆/C respectively. Otherwise, coagels formulations appeared to produce a low IBU depot in the skin and in the same order of magnitude in epidermis and derma, in spite of significant increase of IBU cutaneous permeation. The positive synergic effect of the coagel-PEG mixtures was demonstrated by the high amount of IBU accumulated in the upper skin layers.

A comparison to other lipid nanocarriers such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and polymeric nanocarriers has been made. It was found that LNC could increase the flux rate of ibuprofen 21.9±0.5 compared to 5.8±0.4 μg/cm(2)h in case of drug solution. Similar flux rates were obtained for SLN and NLC with average values of 22.9±0.5 and 22.5±2.0 μg/cm(2)h, respectively. On the other side, comparison to polymeric nanoparticles showed that the polymer-based carriers of the same particle size had lower permeation-enhancing effect with a flux rate of 10.62±1.84 μg/cm(2)h. Polymeric carriers had fourfold higher accumulation in the skin compared to that of the LNC and twice the accumulation of SLN and NLC.

Also, we have tested whether the addition of lauric acid to propylene glycol improves skin permeation for the opioids and NSAIDs. We found that the addition of lauric acid to propylene glycol dramatically improves the penetration of the drugs, measured by the drug's ED(50). We observed a significant dose response shift to the left for all tested drugs. So, morphine's ED(50) was decreased by 19-fold. The duration of the analgesic activity of morphine dissolved in a combination of propylene glycol and lauric acid was much longer compared with the same dose of the drug dissolved in propylene glycol only. Methadone and hydrocodone also produced analgesic activity in this experimental paradigm. We then assessed potential interactions between opioids, ibuprofen and diclofenac using a fixed, low dose of each. The inclusion of either S-ibuprofen or diclofenac to a fixed, low dose of morphine raised the analgesic response from around 20% to 50% and 80%, respectively.

The intrinsic permeability, P(o), the unstirred water layer (UWL) permeability, P(u), and the apparent pK(a) (pK(a)(flux)) were determined from the pH dependence of logP(e). The underlying permeability-pH equations were derived for multiprotic weak acids, weak bases and ampholytes. The average thickness of the unstirred water layer on each side of the membrane was estimated to be nearly 2000 microm, somewhat larger than that found in Caco-2 permeability assays (unstirred). Since the UWL thickness in the human intestine is believed to be about forty times smaller, it is critical to correct the in vitro permeability data for the effect of the UWL. Without such correction, the in vitro permeability coefficient of lipophilic molecules would be indicative only of the property of water. In single-pH PAMPA (e.g. pH 7.4), the uncertainty of the UWL contribution can be minimized if a specially-selected pH (possibly different from 7.4) were used in the assay. From the analysis of the shapes of the log P(e)-pH plots, a method to improve the selection of the assay pH, called pK(a)(flux)-optimized design (pOD-PAMPA), was described and tested.

Reduction of the charge on the molecule would be expected to enhance skin penetration. The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug benzydamine hydrochloride with suitable counter-ions including ibuprofen sodium. The influence of pH of the donor solution and hence degree of ionization on partitioning between n-octanol:buffer and the flux of benzydamine hydrochloride across polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) membrane and human epidermis was determined. The maximum flux was determined at pH 7.6 when the fraction unionized was 2.51%, rather than at pH 9 when the fraction unionized was 38.7%. This suggests that at higher pH, although the permeability coefficient is increased, the decrease in solubility and therefore concentration of dissolved benzydamine in the medium results in a decrease in flux across the PDMS membrane. Ion-pair formation or interaction with each of the counter-ions was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Significant increases in logP and flux across PDMS membrane were determined for the ion-pairs (0.087, 12.54, 11.31, 0.121 microg cm(-2)h(-1) for benzydamine hydrochloride and ion-pairs with ibuprofen sodium, sodium benzoate and sodium octane sulfonate respectively).

The rigorous analysis of the concentration dependence of these processes is often limited by the lack of knowledge of the actual concentration at the site of action because the measurement of the local concentration is seldom feasible. However, the local concentrations can be estimated if the rates into and out of a particular location are known. Thus, an insight into the distribution of the permeation resistance in the in vitro cell monolayer permeation experiments would enable the estimation of local concentrations during the permeation experiments and, consequently, a more thorough analysis of the concentration dependent processes involved in the transepithelial transfer of compounds. In this study, a compartmental model was constructed applicable for dissecting the roles of apical and basal side aqueous boundary layers and the cell membranes in the total permeation barrier for weakly acidic and basic compounds. The model was applied for the analysis of the Caco-2 permeation data of three high permeability compounds, propranolol, metoprolol and ibuprofen.

The anti-inflammatory effect of these NSAID preparations was evaluated in rat models of acute inflammation (carrageenan or yeast treatment) and chronic inflammation (collagen or adjuvant treatment). Skin permeability of the preparations was evaluated in vitro using mouse skin. In rats with acute inflammation, both ketoprofen preparations significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced edema and yeast-induced hyperalgesia. Flurbiprofen and diclofenac preparations also showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect, but the ketoprofen products were the most potent among the four patch preparations and five gel preparations. With repeated application, the ketoprofen patch significantly decreased edema from day 3 in collagen-treated rats, while other preparations (ketoprofen gel, diclofenac patch, and diclofenac gel) decreased edema from day 7. In rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, only the ketoprofen patch significantly decreased edema after 2 weeks of application. In the skin permeation study, the ketoprofen preparations showed higher skin permeability compared with the other NSAID preparations. These results suggested that ketoprofen preparations had the most potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity related to good skin permeability. Efficacy of the ketoprofen patch was comparable to or better than that of ketoprofen gel at a lower dose and frequency of administration.

For this purpose, a simple but reliable syringe-based hot melt/moulding method was employed. Chloramphenicol (antibiotic) and ibuprofen (anti-inflammatory) were chosen as model active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to be loaded into the gfSDFs. To optimize the formulations, the gfSDFs of different compositions were studied in terms of APIs release from the matrix, solid-state characteristics, gellification properties and gfSDFs resistance to mechanical stress. Release studies showed that both APIs were released at a constant rate at different pH (pH5 and 7.4, respectively) and the changes in the formulation composition affected the release behaviour. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results evidenced the complete solubilization of both API in the solid matrix. Texture analysis showed that the gfSDFs were capable of swelling once in a contact with aqueous environment and that the textural properties changed extemporaneously from the solid to gel form.

Triethyl citrate (TEC) was found to be a better liquid plasticizer than PEG 400 both in reducing the glass transition temperature of the coating polymer (cellulose acetate) and in increasing the electrical conductivity of the ODDS cores, both of which led to an enhanced coating powder adhesion and film formation. Results of SEM indicated that the uniformity of the coating film varied significantly with the difference of curing time and temperature.

This work focuses on the evaluation of both rheological and texture properties of EuRL differently plasticized with tributyl citrate (TBC) or triacetin (TRI) in order to design a pressure sensitive adhesive suitable for transdermal patch preparation. The patch adhesive properties (i.e. tack, peel adhesion and shear adhesion) as well as its in vitro biopharmaceutical performances were determined after loading ibuprofen, ketoprofen or flurbiprofen. The addition of 40-60% w/w TBC or 40-50% w/w TRI to EuRL permitted to obtain matrices with the desired adhesive properties. Moreover, the increase of plasticizer content and loading of the drug reduced the relaxation time (τ<sub>R</sub>). Consequently, the shear adhesion values decreased and the in vitro drug release constants (k) increased. Indeed, the k values from patches containing TBC were lower than the corresponding with TRI because of the lower fluidity of such matrices.

The release behavior of ibuprofen from the pectin hydrogels was found to involve 4 modes of release: Fickian diffusion; Anomalous transport; Case-II transport; and Super case II transport. The diffusion coefficient was shown to be significantly improved by two factors: using a FeCl<sub>2</sub> as the crosslinking agent and applied electric potential. For both crosslinking agents, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing crosslinking ratio. Under electric field of 5V, the drug diffusion coefficients of the FeCl<sub>2</sub> and citric acid hydrogels were enhanced by more than a factor of two due to the electro-repulsive interaction between ibuprofen and the negatively charged electrode.

This work aims to evaluate the feasibility to expand this approach to variations of the composition of complex semi-solid preparations. Ibuprofen (IB) creams at two different strengths (i.e., 1 % and 10 %) were used as a model formulation. Two formulative changes were performed: (a) the addition of the humectant to simulate a minor post-marketing variation; (b) the substitution of the emulsifying system to simulate a major one. These variations impacted only in 1 % IB formulations where both the equivalences of rheological data and J-values failed. At the highest concentration, the presence of IB crystals broke down the differences in rheological patterns and lead the IB thermodynamic activity at the maximum figuring out an overlapping of the J-values.

In this work, a comprehensive simulation study on the diffusion of the native <i>α</i>-, <i>β</i>- and <i>γ</i>-CDs in aqueous solutions is carried out using Molecular Dynamics simulations. The effect of the system size on the computed self-diffusivity is investigated and it is found that the required correction can be as much as 75% of the final value. The effect of the water force field is examined and it is shown that the q4md-CD/TIP4P/2005 force field combination predicts the experimentally measured self-diffusion coefficients of CDs very accurately. The self-diffusion coefficients of the three native CDs were also computed in aqueous-NaCl solutions using the Joung and Cheatham (JC) and the Madrid-2019 force fields. It is found that Na + ions have higher affinity towards the CDs when the JC force field is used and for this reason the predicted diffusivity of CDs is lower compared to simulations using the Madrid-2019 force field.

It is therefore important to consider whether ingredients other than the active may: 1) alter absorption of the active chemical, or 2) be absorbed themselves, resulting in systemic effects. Frogs have highly permeable skin and are routinely exposed to commercial chemical products in the environment or therapeutically. Ethanol and propylene glycol (PG), which have known penetration-enhancing effects, are commonly included in such products. The current study has therefore investigated the <i>in vitro</i> absorption kinetics through <i>Rh. marina</i> skin of three model chemicals - caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen - formulated individually as solutions containing: 1%, 10% or 30% v/v ethanol, or 20% v/v PG. Differential scanning calorimetry and histology were used to characterise fresh frog skin, investigate the mechanism of these enhancers in frog skin, and to determine whether these enhancers significantly affected skin structure. Results showed that the extent of absorption enhancement was influenced by chemical, enhancer and skin region, and that enhancement was generally not consistent for individual enhancers or skin regions. The exception was 1% v/v ethanol, which did not significantly alter flux across the skin for any of the chemicals evaluated. Caffeine absorption was not enhanced by any of the investigated penetration enhancers, and was in fact significantly reduced by 30% v/v ethanol and PG. Ethanol caused concentration-dependant changes in skin morphology and should be avoided in concentrations ≥10% v/v. PG, however, caused minimal changes to the skin and consistently improved absorption of benzoic acid and ibuprofen through all skin regions. Owing to the significant changes in skin structure following ≥10% v/v ethanol exposure, it is recommended to avoid its use in frogs.

A variety of liquids, encompassing natural oils, synthetic and non-oil liquids, and a eutectic mixture, were incorporated with NR using solvent displacement technique. Successful formulations were achieved for several oily liquids, with viscosity correlating to NR concentration. Particularly, a eutectic mixture of menthol and camphor exhibited optimal viscosity by direct dissolving enabling the development of transdermal ibuprofen delivery and injectable azithromycin for periodontitis treatment. NR prolonged the release of both drugs. The extended-release ibuprofen system holds promise for transdermal applications, while the azithromycin system displayed inhibitory effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, suggesting potential for periodontitis treatment.

This study explored the synthesis of dual stimuli-responsive composite hydrogels by combining poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) with 4, 8, and 12 % (w/w) of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) through in-situ free-radical polymerization, modifying their properties for topical anti-inflammatory release. Although PDMAEMA-based hydrogels have been known for their responsiveness to pH and temperature stimuli, which are useful for modulating the release profile of drugs, their use as a matrix for anti-inflammatory topical applications remains unexplored. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of CNC concentration's impact on PDMAEMA-based hydrogel structure and physicochemical properties is provided. The incorporation of ibuprofen as an anti-inflammatory model was assessed, providing insights into the potential of these composite hydrogels for sustained drug delivery applications. Overall, the hydrogels exhibited homogenous CNC dispersion, with gel fraction higher than 70 % and ibuprofen load higher than 90 %. The rise in CNC concentration led to an increase hydrogel stiffness.

Our previous studies have shown that while electrospun nanofiber-bundle membranes promote cellular and tissue infiltration through their porous architecture, they also induce an elevated foreign body response (FBR) that impedes tissue integration and remodeling. In this study, we functionalized electrospun polylactic acid (PLA)/gelatin (Gel) nanofiber-bundle membrane with chitosan (CS) and ibuprofen (IBU) to improve its biological performance for abdominal wall repair. Our results demonstrate that grafted CS and IBU functionalize the PLA/Gel membrane with antibacterial and antioxidant capacity. The PLA/Gel-CS-IBU membrane showed good biocompatibility as evidenced by in vitro cell studies, blood compatibility assessments, and subcutaneous implantation. It exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activity and modulated macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. CS-IBU grafting downregulated pro-inflammatory gene expression induced by the porous electrospun membrane surface, decreased oxidative products from activated macrophages, and upregulated anti-inflammatory genes. By markedly suppressing inflammatory responses and stimulating tissue regeneration, it facilitated effective tissue remodeling in a rat full-thickness abdominal wall model.

Starting with equimolar egg-phosphatidylcholine (PC)/cholesterol liposomes, the influence of the liposomal composition and surface charge on the incorporation and retention of a model poorly water soluble drug, ibuprofen was investigated. Both the incorporation and the release of ibuprofen were influenced by the lipid composition of the multi-lamellar vesicles (MLV) with inclusion of the long alkyl chain lipid (dilignoceroyl phosphatidylcholine (C24PC)) resulting in enhanced ibuprofen incorporation efficiency and retention. The cholesterol content of the liposome bilayer was also shown to influence ibuprofen incorporation with maximum ibuprofen incorporation efficiency achieved when 4 micromol of cholesterol was present in the MLV formulation. Addition of anionic lipid dicetylphosphate (DCP) reduced ibuprofen drug loading presumably due to electrostatic repulsive forces between the carboxyl group of ibuprofen and the anionic head-group of DCP. In contrast, the addition of 2 micromol of the cationic lipid stearylamine (SA) to the liposome formulation (PC:Chol - 16 micromol:4 micromol) increased ibuprofen incorporation efficiency by approximately 8%. However further increases of the SA content to 4 micromol and above reduced incorporation by almost 50% compared to liposome formulations excluding the cationic lipid. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was used to dynamically follow the changes in liposome morphology during dehydration to provide an alternative assay of liposome stability. ESEM analysis clearly demonstrated that ibuprofen incorporation improved the stability of PC:Chol liposomes as evidenced by an increased resistance to coalescence during dehydration.

We also explored the association of lactic acid and iontophoresis as a means of enhancing drug delivery. Permeation experiments were performed in vitro, using rabbit ear skin as barrier. The results obtained indicate that lactic acid has some effects on model drug permeation across the skin. The effect was more evident with the anionic drug ibuprofen. Cathodal intophoresis increased ibuprofen transport, but when lactic acid was associated with cathodal iontophoresis, a concentration-dependent reduction of ibuprofen iontophoretic flux was observed, probably for the competition by the co-ion.

Ethyl oleate (EO) was screened as the oil phase of microemulsions, due to a good solubilizing capacity of the microemulison systems and excellent skin permeation rate of ibuprofen. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams for microemulsion regions were constructed using ethyl oleate as the oil, Tween 80 as the surfactant, propylene glycol as the cosurfactant. Various microemulsion formulations were prepared and the abilities of various microemulsions to deliver ibuprofen through the skin were evaluated in vitro using Franz diffusion cells fitted with porcine skins. The in vitro permeation data showed that microemulsions increased the permeation rate of ibuprofen 5.72-30.0 times over the saturated solution. The optimum formulation consisted of 3% ibuprofen, 6% EO, 30% Tween 80/PG (2:1) and water, showed a high permeation rate of 38.06 microg cm(-2) h(-1).

Diffusion studies of saturated solutions in 50:50 water/ethanol of methyl paraben (MP), ibuprofen (IBU) and caffeine (CF) were performed on Carbosil membrane. The spectroscopic data were analysed by target factor analysis, and evolution profiles of the signal for each component (i.e. the drug, water, ethanol and membrane) over time were obtained. Results showed that the data were successfully deconvoluted as correlations between factors from the data and reference spectra of the components, were above 0.8 in all cases. Good reproducibility over three runs for the evolution profiles was obtained. From the evolution profiles it was observed that water diffused better through the Carbosil membrane than ethanol, confirming the hydrophilic properties of the Carbosil membrane used. IBU diffused slower compared with MP and CF. The evolution profile of CF was very similar to that of water, probably because of the high solubility of CF in water, indicating that both compounds are diffusing concurrently. The second part of the work involved a study of the evolution profiles of the components of a commercial topical gel containing 5% (w/w) of ibuprofen as it permeated through human skin.

Initially porous/non-porous, ibuprofen/lidocaine/propranolol HCl-loaded systems were exposed to phosphate buffer pH 7.4 in agitated test tubes, varying the microparticle concentration from 5:1 to 20:1mg:mL. Interestingly, drug release was virtually unaffected by the ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratio in the case of initially porous, ibuprofen-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete drug release within about 1 week. Optical microscopy, SEM, DSC and pH measurements of the bulk fluid revealed no major impact of the microparticle concentration on the systems' properties within the first couple of days. However, a more rapid and pronounced decrease in the pH of the release medium occurred after 10-14 d at elevated ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratios. This resulted in an accelerated: (i) decrease in the glass transition temperature, (ii) microparticle agglomeration, and (iii) increase in the internal and external microparticle porosity. Importantly, this phenomenon did not significantly affect drug release from initially porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete release within about 18 d. In contrast, drug release became significantly faster at higher ""microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume"" ratios in the case of initially non-porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles and initially porous, propranolol HCl-loaded systems, exhibiting complete release after 1 and 2 months, respectively.

The primary surfactant was PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides (Labrasol). The cosurfactants were commercially available mixtures of octoxynol-12 and polysorbate 20 without or with the addition of PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil (Solubilisant gamma 2421 and Solubilisant gamma 2429, respectively). The oil phase of microemulsions was isopropyl myristate. Phase behaviour study of the pseudo-ternary systems Labrasol/cosurfactant/oil/water at surfactant-to-cosurfactant weight ratios (K(m)) 40:60, 50:50 and 60:40, revealed a strong synergism in the investigated tensides mixtures for stabilisation of microemulsions containing up to 80% (w/w) of water phase at surfactant +cosurfactant-to-oil weight ratio (SCoS/O) 90:10. Solubilization of a model drug ibuprofen in concentration common for topical application (5%, w/w) was achieved at the water contents below 50% (w/w). Drug free and ibuprofen-loaded microemulsions M1-M6, containing 45% (w/w) of water phase, were prepared and characterized by polarized light microscopy, conductivity, pH, rheological and droplet size measurements. In vitro ibuprofen release kinetics from the microemulsions was investigated using paddle-over-enhancer cell method and compared with the commercial 5% (w/w) ibuprofen hydrogel product (Deep Relief, Mentholatum Company Ltd., USA). The investigated microemulsions were isotropic, low viscous Bingham-type liquids with the pH value (4.70-6.61) suitable for topical application. The different efficiency of the tensides mixtures for microemulsion stabilisation was observed, depending on the cosurfactant type and K(m) value. Solubilisant gamma 2429 as well as higher K(m) (i.e., lower relative content of the cosurfactant) provided higher surfactant/cosurfactant synergism. The drug molecules were predominantly solubilized within the interface film. The amount of drug released from the formulations M3 (10.75%, w/w) and M6 (13.45%, w/w) (K(m) 60:40) was limited in comparison with the reference (22.22%, w/w) and follows the Higuchi model. Microemulsions M2 and M5 (K(m) 50:50) gave zero order drug release pattern and ∼15% (w/w) ibuprofen released. The release profiles from microemulsions M1 and M4 (K(m) 40:60) did not fit well with the models used for analysis, although the amounts of ibuprofen released (24.47%, w/w) and 17.99% (w/w), respectively) were comparable to that of the reference hydrogel.

The main drawback for the transdermal route, however, is the low efficiency achieved in the absorption of many drugs, mostly due to the complexity of the skin barrier. To improve drug delivery through the skin, we prepared and characterized liposomes loaded with ibuprofen and designed pharmaceutical formulations based on the extemporaneous addition of penetration enhancer (PE) surfactants. Afterwards, permeation and release studies were carried out. According to the permeation studies, the ibuprofen liposomal formulation supplemented with PEs exhibited similar therapeutic effects, but at lower doses (20%) comparing with a commercial formulation used as a reference. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the effect caused by PEs on the adsorption mechanism of liposomal formulations onto the skin. Non-fused liposomes, bilayers and multilayered lipid structures were observed.

However, The transdermal enhancement mechanism of iontophoresis was not well known. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of drugs and the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis was revealed in this study. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used as the models, including aspirin, ibuprofen and indomethacin. Their oil-water partition coefficients were measured. The carbomer-based hydrogels of them were prepared. Iontophoresis significantly enhanced in vitro transdermal delivery across the rat skins. Strong lipophilicity could lead to high permeation of drugs. However, the dissociation extent (indicated as pKa) of drugs was the key factor to determine the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis. The more dissociation the drugs were, the higher the transdermal enhancement effect of iontophoresis. The drug-loaded hydrogels combined with iontophoresis improved the treatment of rat raw's inflammatory syndrome. Iontophoresis significantly improved the drugs penetrating into the hypodermis, dermis and epidermis, more deeply than the application of drugs alone according to the experimental result of 5-carboxylfluorescein hydrogels.

The ternary nanogels were prepared by a combination of electrostatic nanoassembly and ionic gelation techniques. The electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding between ibuprofen and chitosan were confirmed with FTIR, while DSC, TGA and SEM confirmed the physical state, thermal and morphological characteristics, respectively. The ex vivo delivery of ibuprofen onto and across the skin was evaluated based on system specific drug release parameters such as steady state permeation rate, permeability coefficient, permeability enhancement ratio, skin/gel partition coefficient, diffusion coefficient, lag time and release rate constant and mechanisms of release were determined using mathematical models. Interaction between ibuprofen and chitosan produced new spherical eutectic nanoconjugates with remarkable decrease in particle size of ibuprofen from 4580 (length-to-breadth aspect ratio) to a minimum of 14.15 nm (324-times), and thermally stable amorphous characteristics. The nanogels exhibited significant elastic and pseudoplastic characteristics dictated by the concentration of chitosan with maximum swelling capacity of 775% w/w at 6.55 mM chitosan compared with 281.16 and 506.50% for plain gellan and control ibuprofen hydrogel, respectively. Chitosan enhanced the skin penetration, permeability and the rate of transdermal release of ibuprofen by a factor of 4, dictated by the extent of ibuprofen-chitosan ionic interaction and its concentration.

Formulation study of pseudo-ternary system liquid lecithin/poloxamer 407/water at constant liquid lecithin/poloxamer 407 mass ratio (2.0) revealed that minimum concentrations of liquid lecithin and poloxamer 407 required for formation of gel like systems were 15.75% w/w and 13.13% w/w, respectively, while the maximum content of water was 60.62% w/w. The systems comprising water concentrations in a range from 55 to 60.62% w/w were soft semisolids suitable for topical application, and they were selected for physicochemical and biopharmaceutical evaluation.

However there are ethical and safety issues associated with obtaining human tissue. For these reasons synthetic membranes, cell culture models or in silico predictive algorithms have been researched intensively as alternative approaches to predict dermal exposure in man. Porcine skin has also been recommended as an acceptable surrogate for topical or transdermal delivery research. Here we examine the in vitro permeation of a model active, ibuprofen, using human or porcine skin, as well as the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assay (PAMPA) model and silicone membrane. Finite dose studies were conducted in all models using commercial ibuprofen formulations and simple volatile ibuprofen solutions. The dose applied in the PAMPA model was also varied in order to determine the amount of applied formulation which best simulates typical amounts of topical products applied by patients or consumers. Permeation studies were conducted up to 6h for PAMPA and silicone and up to 48h for human and porcine skin. Cumulative amounts permeated at 6h were comparable for PAMPA and silicone, ranging from 91 to 136μg/cm(2) across the range of formulations studied. At 48h, maximum ibuprofen permeation in human skin ranged from 11 to 38μg/cm(2) and corresponding values in porcine skin were 59-81μg/cm(2). A dose of 1μL was confirmed as appropriate for finite dose studies in the PAMPA model. The formulation which delivered the greatest amount of ibuprofen in human skin was also significantly more efficient than other formulations when evaluated in the PAMPA model. The PAMPA model also discriminated between different formulation types (i.e. gel versus solution) compared with other models. Overall, the results confirm the more permeable nature of the PAMPA, silicone membrane and porcine tissue models to ibuprofen compared with human skin. Further finite dose studies to elucidate the effects of individual excipients on the barrier properties of the PAMPA model are needed to expand the applications of this model.

Liposomes loaded and unloaded with ibuprofen and hyaluronic acid were characterized by quasi-elastic light scattering and fluorescence polarization. Optimized liposomes, with and without drugs, were applied onto human skin and the structures formed evaluated using atomic force microscopy.

Encapsulation of drugs into nanoparticles is proposed here as a promising tool for regulating drug crystallization in transdermal patches. The degree of recrystallization and transdermal permeation of ibuprofen and hydrocortisone loaded in polymeric and lipid nanoparticles from matrix-type transdermal patches were investigated. Ethyl cellulose (EC4), poly (lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) were employed for polymeric nanoparticle preparations; while medium chain triglyceride (MCT) and witepsol were used for the preparation of MCT nanoemulsion and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), respectively. As control, similar patches were prepared containing the free form of the investigated model drugs. All nanoparticle-containing transdermal patches exhibited less degree of drug recrystallization after 4 weeks compared to the control groups. Among the investigated nanocarriers, transdermal patches formulated with drug-loaded lipid nanoparticles showed the lowermost degree of recrystallization. Drug encapsulation into SLNs succeeded to reduce the degree of ibuprofen and hydrocortisone recrystallization from 23.3 ± 0.9 and 21.9 ± 1.2% to 0.2 ± 0.1 and 1.8 ± 0.1%, respectively. Additionally, the decreased crystalline fraction was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the drug flux through excised pig skin, which was found to be correlated to the hydrophobicity of the different nanocarriers.

The HFMNs swell by imbibing interstitial skin fluid (ISF), and they facilitate drug transport from the reservoir attached at the base into the skin without polymer dissolution. To develop HFMNs for practical applications, a complete understanding of the drug transport mechanism is required, allowing for controlled TDD and geometrical optimisation. A three-phase system consisting of a reservoir, microneedle, and skin is considered. A mathematical model is developed to incorporate the drug binding within the matrix of the compartment, which was not considered earlier. Super-swelling nature of the HFMNs is incorporated through the swelling ratio obtained experimentally for a polymer. The results are validated with in vitro diffusion studies of ibuprofen sodium (IBU) across excised porcine skin, showing that around 20% of the loaded IBU in lyophilised wafer was delivered in 24 h. It was observed that increasing IBU solubility in reservoir can achieve high drug transport across the skin. The developed model is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

Seven drugs with different physicochemical parameters including clonidine (CLO), flurbiprofen (FLU), diclofenac (DIC), ibuprofen (IBU), zolmitriptan (ZOL), lidocaine (LID), tulobuterol (TUL) and the mixed adhesive (7:3, w/w) of Oppanol® B 15 N (M.W. = 108,000 Da) and Oppanol® N 50 (M.W. = 565,000 Da) were selected for in vitro drug release and skin permeation studies. Regression analysis was used to study the relationship between physicochemical parameters and release behaviors. The release behaviors of drugs were a negative correlation with polarizability and dipole moment per molecular volume (μ/V), which represented van der Waals and dipole-dipole interaction, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and molecular dynamics simulation were used to provide molecular details of the interaction between the drug and PIB. The free volume and molecular mobility of PIB were characterized using mechanical property tests, rheology study, MDSC and molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the above results, drugs with high polarizability and μ/V had stronger van der Waals and dipole-dipole interaction with PIB, reducing the free volume and molecular mobility of PIB, so that the drug struggled to release from PIB. In addition, the diffusion activation energy of the drug was calculated by using the variable temperature release study to characterize the ease of drug release from the kinetic aspect. And the trends of in vitro drug release and skin penetration profiles were basically similar. Thus, it was thought that the physicochemical parameters of the drug played a vital role in the drug release behavior of PIB PSAs and would affect the skin penetration process, which provided a reference for the design and application of patches based on PIB PSAs in TDDS.",2023,,"Ding D, Liu C, Zhang Y, Xu W, Cai Y, Zhong T, Fang L.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2022.122416,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"[""Details on ibuprofen's release mechanism"", 'Quantitative data on permeation rates', 'Comparative analysis with other drugs', 'Formulation specifics of PIB PSA']","The abstract discusses in vitro release behaviors of ibuprofen from a polyisobutylene matrix, indicating it has relevant formulation and measurable endpoints related to permeation.

Among the existing 3D printing techniques, direct powder extrusion (DPE) resulted as the most practical approach thanks to the possibility to directly process excipients and drugs in a single step. The main goal of this work was to determine whether different grades of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer might be employed as new feedstock materials for the DPE technique to manufacture transdermal patches. By selecting two model drugs with different thermal behavior, (i.e., ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium) we also wanted to pay attention to the versatility of EVA excipient in preparing patches for customized transdermal therapies. EVA was combined with 30 % (w/w) of each model drugs. The physicochemical composition of the printed devices was investigated through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analyses. FT-IR spectra confirmed that the starting materials were effectively incorporated into the final formulation, and thermal analyses demonstrated that the extrusion process altered the crystalline morphology of the raw polymers inducing the formation of crystals at lower thicknesses. Lastly, the drug release and permeation profile of the printed systems was evaluated for 48 h and showed to be dependent on the VA content of the EVA grade (74.5 % of ibuprofen released from EVA 4030AC matrix and 12.6 % of diclofenac sodium released from EVA1821A matrix). Hence, this study demonstrated that EVA and direct powder extrusion technique could be promising tools for manufacturing transdermal patches.

Inkjet printing and micromolding are established methods for the production of microneedle array patches and both were used to combine lisinopril embedded in povidone and ibuprofen in Eudragit® RS / RL in a single patch. Dissolution studies, visual inspection, mechanical strength and insertion into an artificial skin membrane model were investigated. A clear spatial separation of the polymers / drugs was observed. Microneedle array patches containing povidone and Eudragit® RS / RL showed a height reduction below 10 %. 97.14 ± 3.76 % of the microneedles made of povidone and Eudragit® RS and 97.50 ± 2.13 % made of povidone and Eudragit® RL pierced the second layer of Parafilm® M.

Traditionally, formulation development relies on empirical knowledge and trial-and-error experiments. In this paper, we introduced the Bayesian optimisation method and compared it with the traditional response surface methodology (RSM) for topical drug formulation. The objective was to optimise the formulation composition of ibuprofen gel-like to achieve a maximum flux through in vitro permeation tests (IVPTs). As a model system, poloxamer 407, ethanol, and propylene glycol (PG) were selected as the key excipients, whose concentrations were optimised. Strat-M membrane, serving as a surrogate for human skin, and Franz cell diffusion were employed in IVPTs. Two sets of experiments were conducted under identical conditions for 30 h. Under the RSM approach, the optimised ibuprofen gel-like formulation was identified with a poloxamer 407: ethanol: PG ratio of 20:20:10, achieving a measured permeation flux of 11.28 ± 0.35 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. In comparison, Bayesian optimisation, after four iterations, yielded an optimised formulation with a ratio of 20.95:19.44:12.14, resulting in a permeation flux of 14.15 ± 0.77 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>.

This study was designed to compare the effects of emulsifiers on the physicochemical properties and <i>in vitro</i> skin performance of SLNs prepared from a binary mixture of Softisan® 378 (S378) and cetyl palmitate (CP) to those of SLNs prepared from only CP and S378.<h4>Experiments</h4>SLNs were prepared from CP, S378, or a binary mixture of CP and S378 (1:1 <i>w</i>/w) as the lipid phase and stabilized with Tego®Care 450 (TG450) or poloxamer 188 (P188) containing 1.0% <i>w</i>/w ibuprofen loading. The physicochemical properties including the particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), encapsulation efficiency (E.E.), crystallinity (%CI), and polymorphism were determined after production and after storage for 180 days under different conditions. In addition, <i>in vitro</i> drug release and permeation through human skin was studied after production and storage at room temperature for 180 days.<h4>Finding</h4>The particle sizes of ibuprofen-loaded SLNs (IBSLNs) stabilized with P188 (IBSLN-P188) were smaller than those of SLNs stabilized with TG450 (IBSLN-TG450) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). After 180 days, the particle sizes of the IBSLNs were slightly increased compared to those at the initial time but were <250 nm. The IBSLN-TG450 sample showed a higher %CI than IBSLN-P188 prepared with similar propotions of CP and S378, and ibuprofen crystals were observed in the IBSLN1-TG450 sample after storage at 4 °C for 180 days. Based on the result of the <i>in vitro</i> release study and the <i>in vitro</i> skin permeation test, the addition of S378 into the CP-matrix modified ibuprofen release and skin permeation both permeated ibuprofen through the epidermis and retained ibuprofen in the epidermis.

MED,15544868,15544868.0,10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.08.011,Transdermal self-permeation enhancement of ibuprofen.,"The objective of this study was to prepare saturated solutions of ibuprofen, of different concentrations, and to investigate their effect on permeation of ibuprofen across rat epidermis. Ibuprofen saturated solutions were prepared using 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 M disodium hydrogen phosphate solution (DHP). The solubility of ibuprofen in DHP increased as the molarity of DHP increased. Thus the four saturated solutions of ibuprofen (0.1M-DHP-IBU, 0.2M-DHP-IBU, 0.3M-DHP-IBU and 0.4M-DHP-IBU) have different concentrations of the same drug, and showed same pH (pH 7.0+/-1). The permeability study was also carried out using human epidermis and silastic membrane. Permeation rate of ibuprofen across rat epidermis and human epidermis from 0.4M-DHP-IBU was much greater than from 0.1M-DHP-IBU. The magnitudes of increase in the drug flux were 46.4-fold with rat epidermis and 9.4-fold with human epidermis. Such a great increase in drug flux was not observed with silastic membrane, only 1.4-fold. This suggests that the increased drug flux is likely due to drug-skin interaction and not the increased concentration of ibuprofen per se. Surface tension (ST) measurements of DHP versus ibuprofen concentration showed ST reduction of DHP, from 72 to 27.9 dyn/cm. This is an indication that ibuprofen acted as ionic surfactant and the observed skin permeability enhancement is attributed to disruption of stratum corneum barrier. Results of DSC study supported this assumption. DSC of untreated rat stratum corneum samples showed lipid transitions at 41.9+/-0.0 degrees C (T1), 55.1+/-1.6 degrees C (T(x)), 70.2+/-0.1 degrees C (T2) and 77.5+/-0.1 degrees C (T3), while those pretreated with 0.4M-DHP-IBU did not show the first three lipid transitions. Also, pretreatment of rat epidermis with 0.4M-DHP-IBU enhanced permeation of diclofenac sodium greater than 1250-fold. This corroborates that ibuprofen not only enhances its own permeation but also that of other drugs, such as diclofenac sodium.",2004,,Al-Saidan SM.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.08.011,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed formulation of ibuprofen in DHP', 'Experimental setup for diffusion cells', 'Exact measurements of permeation rates', 'Additional findings regarding skin interaction']","The study focuses on the transdermal permeation of ibuprofen, indicating relevance to drug diffusion methodologies.

However, often during the biodegradation process, these barriers trigger inflammation and cause a foreign body reaction with subsequent decrease in anti-adhesion efficacy. Here, a facile strategy comprising the incorporation of ibuprofen (IBU) into implantable membranes and its sustained release was proposed in order to improve anti-adhesion effects and neurological outcomes, namely to prevent failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). The combination of free IBU and a newly synthetized polymeric prodrug of IBU, namely poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with ester-linked IBU, was successfully used in order to reduce initial burst drug release and provide sustained drug release from fibrous membranes throughout several weeks. Such release profile was shown useful in preventing both acute and chronic inflammation in rats following laminectomy and membrane implantation. Moreover, histological analysis provided evidence of an excellent anti-adhesion effect, while associated neurological deficits were effectively reduced. Furthermore, the assessment of macrophage density, neovascularization, and related gene expression at the lesion site revealed that a sustained anti-inflammatory effect was achieved with the IBU-loaded proposed fibrous membranes. Results suggested that the COX2 pathway plays an important role in the development epidural fibrosis and arachnoiditis.

Local and systemic effects of topically applied compounds can be significantly increased by plant constituents having skin penetration enhancers.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this study, we examined the proposed penetration enhancing properties of spilanthol, an N-alkylamide abundantly present in several Asteraceae plants like Spilanthes acmella L., on three model drugs (caffeine, testosterone and ibuprofen). Moreover, as plants are frequently contaminated with toxic environmental substances, the mutual influence on the transdermal behavior between spilanthol and six model mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fumonisin B1, citrinin, zearalenone, T-2 toxin) was investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Spilanthol exhibits component and concentration dependent penetration enhancing effects. No significant penetration enhancing effect for ibuprofen has been observed, but with increasing spilanthol concentration (from 0 up to 1w/V%), the permeability of caffeine increased, resulting in an enhancing ratio (ER) of 4.60. For testosterone, a maximal penetration enhancing concentration of 0.5% spilanthol was found (ER=4.13). Next to its beneficial applicability to increase local as well as systemic pharmacological effects of dermally co-administrated drug, this N-alkylamide negatively influences human health risk if spilanthol containing formulations are polluted with mycotoxins: the presence of spilanthol (0.3w/V%) induced a significant increase of permeability coefficient Kp of five investigated mycotoxins, with ER values ranging between 1.57 and 6.37.

The majority of intercellular lipids are in a solid state at normal humidity (RH) and ambient temperature; however, several studies indicate that a small fraction exist in a fluid state. In a previous work, a preferential solubilization of fluid skin lipids by acetone (Ac) was envisaged. A different change in the skin permeability related to the different lipid structures of the extracted lipids was suggested. To increase the knowledge of the specific role of different lipids on skin structure, a selective lipid modification is proposed. This study assess the effect of Ac on skin barrier lipids in-depth. Synchrotron based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR), which is used to study SC lipid organization, revealed a more ordered lipid organization after Ac treatment. In vitro experiments using Franz cells, which were selected to follow the SC barrier function capability, demonstrated that Ac-treated skin retained caffeine and ibuprofen on the SC with very low permeation of both compounds into the deeper skin layers. In vitro transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements revealed the ability of Ac to induce a less water permeated skin. Although an important lipid fraction has been removed, Ac skin treatment brings to a skin where the remaining lipids promote an improved barrier function.

The polymers selected for this study were poly(TRIM) and poly(HEMA-<i>co</i>-TRIM) produced in the form of permanently porous beads via the suspension-emulsion polymerization method. The acid and base set ternary composites were prepared by the saturation of the solid dispersions of drug (poly(TRIM)-IBS and/or poly(HEMA-<i>co</i>-TRIM)-IBS) with TEOS, and followed by their exposition to the vapour mixture of water and ammonia, or water and hydrochloric acid, at autogenous pressure. The conducted analyses reveal that the internal structure and total porosity of the resulting composites strongly depend on the catalyst which was used for silica precursor gelation. The parameters characterizing the porosity of both of the acid set composites are much lower than the parameters of the base set composites.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate and quantify the transport mechanisms that control the release of drugs from polymer-based sandwich membranes produced using the electrospinning processes. These electrospun membranes were composed of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) because it is one of the most promising biodegradable polymers due to its mechanical properties, thermoplastic processability and biological properties, such as its biocompatibility and biodegradability. The transport mechanism that controls the drug delivery was evaluated via the release kinetics of a bioactive agent in physiological serum, which was used as a corporal fluid simulation. To describe the delivery process, mathematical models, such as the Power Law, the classical Higuchi equation and an approach to Fick's Second Law were used.

In this study, electrospun blend fibers were produced from polyethylene oxide (PEO) and ethyl cellulose (EC) at various compositions to encapsulate a poorly water-soluble drug of ibuprofen (IBP) at 30% loading. Microscopic evaluation showed smooth and defect-free fiber morphologies for blank and IBP-loaded PEO/EC fibers. The average fiber diameters and fiber yields suggested a potential optimization on the blend fiber composition for the electrospun drug-eluting PEO/EC fibers, where the highest average fiber diameter and fiber yield occurred at 50PEO/50EC fiber composition. Surface wettability studies demonstrated the effects on surface hydrophobicity from blend fibers of water-soluble PEO and hydrophobic EC as well as the incorporation of IBP. In addition, blend fibers containing more PEO promoted the water absorption rates through dissolution of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, results from mechanical testing of the blend fibers showed the highest fiber elastic modulus and tensile strength at fiber compositions in between 75PEO/25EC and 50PEO/50EC, corresponding to the average fiber diameter measurements. The in vitro IBP release rates demonstrated a dependence on the EC compositions supported by the surface wettability and water absorption rate studies. In general, our work demonstrated the ability to electrospin blank and IBP-loaded PEO/EC fibers with the scientific understandings of EC compositions on modulations of fiber physicomechanical properties and in vitro drug release rates.

In diffuse brain-injured rats, a chronic sensory sensitivity to whisker stimulation models the agitation of TBI survivors and provides anatomical landmarks across the whisker-barrel circuit to evaluate post-traumatic neuropathology. As a consequence of TBI, acute and chronic microglial activation can contribute to degenerative and reparative events underlying post-traumatic morbidity. Here we hypothesize that a temporal sequence of microglial activation states contributes to the circuit pathology responsible for post-traumatic morbidity, and test the hypothesis by examining microglial morphological activation and neuroinflammatory markers for activation states through gene expression and receptor-binding affinity. Adult male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a single moderate midline fluid percussion injury (FPI) or sham injury. Microglial activation was determined by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and receptor autoradiography in the primary somatosensory barrel field (S1BF) and ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus at 7 and 28 days following FPI. Morphological changes indicative of microglial activation, including swollen cell body with thicker, shrunken processes, were evident in S1BF and VPM at 7 and 28 days post-injury. Principally at 7 days post-injury in VPM, general inflammatory gene expression (major histocompatibility complex I, major histocompatibility complex II, translocator protein 18 kDa [TSPO]) is increased above sham level and TSPO gene expression confirmed by receptor autoradiography. Further, CD45, a marker of classical activation, and TGF-βI, an acquired deactivation marker, were elevated significantly above sham at 7 days post-injury. Daily administration of the anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (20mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the expression of these genes. Evidence for alternative activation (arginase 1) was not observed. Thus, these data demonstrate concomitant classical activation and acquired deactivation phenotypes of microglia in diffuse TBI in the absence of overt contusion or cavitation.

Hydrogel-based transdermal formulations were developed with ibuprofen as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Transcutol and sucrose esters were used as biocompatible penetration enhancers. The permeability measurements were performed with ex vivo Franz diffusion cell methods and a newly developed Skin Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assays (PAMPA) model. Franz diffusion measurement is commonly used as a research tool in studies of diffusion through synthetic membranes in vitro or penetration through ex vivo human skin, whereas Skin PAMPA involves recently published artificial membrane-based technology for the fast prediction of skin penetration. It is a 96-well plate-based model with optimized artificial membrane structure containing free fatty acid, cholesterol, and synthetic ceramide analog compounds to mimic the stratum corneum barrier function. Transdermal preparations containing 2.64% of different sucrose esters and/or Transcutol and a constant (5%) of ibuprofen were investigated to determine the effects of these penetration enhancers. The study demonstrated the good correlation of the permeability data obtained through use of human skin membrane and the in vitro Skin PAMPA system.

A range of ibu:terpene binary mixtures were melted together, cooled, and recrystallised. Composition/melting point phase diagrams were determined by DSC and FT-IR analysis was used to investigated the nature of the interaction. Permeation of ibu across human epidermal membrane from the eutectic system was measured and compared to the flux from a saturated aqueous solution across skin and skin pretreated with the terpenes. The eutectic, i.e. minimum, melting points of these systems ranged from 32 degrees C for ibu:thymol 40:60 (% w/w) to -13 degrees C for ibu:1,8-cineole 40:60 (% w/w) compared to 76 degrees C for ibu alone. FT-IR studies indicated that only the terpenes which formed hydrogen bonds with ibu produced eutectic systems. Each set of ibu:terpene eutectic systems produced a significant (t-test, p = 0.05) increase in flux compared to a saturated aqueous solution applied to untreated and to terpene pretreated skin. For example, ibu:thymol 40:60 (% w/w) produced a flux of 150 micrograms/cm2/h, 5.9 times the flux from a saturated aqueous solution with thymol pretreated skin and 12.7 times the flux from a saturated aqueous solution across non-pretreated skin.

The skin permeation of ibuprofen from a series of 17 polyoxyethylene (POE) alkyl ethers containing 5% ibuprofen was determined using Franz diffusion cells fitted with excised rat skins. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were performed for the physicochemical characterization of ibuprofen-surfactant interaction. In vitro transdermal flux through excised rat skin was found in the decreasing order of POE(5)cetyl/oleyl ether (110.24 microg/cm(2)/h)>POE(2)lauryl ether (99.91 microg/cm(2)/h)>POE(2)oleyl ether (67.46 microg/cm(2)/h)>POE(10)stearyl ether (66.19 microg/cm(2)/h).

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effect of HA with other glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulphate (CS), heparin (HP)) and pharmaceutically relevant polysaccharides (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and pectin) on the dermal partitioning and percutaneous penetration of diclofenac and ibuprofen. The studies demonstrated that HA significantly enhanced the partitioning of both diclofenac and ibuprofen into human skin when compared to an aqueous control, pectin and carboxymethylcellulose (P<0.01). Although the HA vehicle increased the partitioning of both drugs compared to the effects of the other glycosaminoglycans, CS and HP, this difference was not significant (P>0.05). However, the results from the Franz cell diffusion studies showed that HA (1% w/w) significantly enhanced the amount of drug localising within the skin when compared to all of the other polysaccharides (P<0.05).

The steady state fluxes of ibuprofen and ketoprofen were 9.17+/-1.98 microgram cm(-2)h(-1) and 6.12+/-2.39 microgram cm(-2)h(-1), respectively. At 24h, 5.7 microgram cm(-2) EPA and 3.1 microgram cm(-2) DHA permeated when the solute was ibuprofen; 1.4 microgram cm(-2) EPA and 1.0 microgram cm(-2) DHA when ketoprofen was the solute. At 12h, the ketoprofen/ibuprofen ratio of the moles permeated was 0.27, the ratio of EPA permeated simultaneously with ketoprofen and ibuprofen was 0.22 and the ratio of DHA permeated simultaneously with ketoprofen and ibuprofen was 0.24. We believe this is the first time that simultaneous permeation across skin of a solute and its vehicle has been determined purposefully. The data successfully demonstrated that simultaneous permeation of NSAIDs and essential fatty acids, EPA and DHA from a formulation containing fish oil is feasible. In addition, for both NSAIDs, the relative rates of permeation of EPA and DHA, were in proportion to their levels in the fish oil and the permeation rate of either fatty acid was higher when the permeation rate of the solute was greater. This suggested that the greater the rate of permeation of the NSAID, the greater the rate of permeation of the vehicle, and that a solute permeates skin complete with its vehicular solvation cage.

Post-iontophoresis transport of ibuprofen from lysine salt solutions linearly depended on the total amount of current applied during iontophoresis, and in the absence of background ions was independent of donor drug concentration.

Our research focused on physico-chemical characterization of ternary systems containing ibuprofen lysinate, lecithin and water. The influence of the resulting microstructures on drug release and permeation through excised human stratum corneum was also investigated. Depending on the mixing ratio different physical states (lamellar and hexagonal liquid crystals, micellar solutions, liposomal dispersions and biphasic systems) were determined by gross, polarizing microscopic and small angle-X-ray analysis. A special emphasis was laid upon the storage-induced transformation of liposomal dispersions into mixed micellar solutions and its influence on drug release and permeation. A model for the transformation process is presented. Drug release of the liposomal dispersion (Da=1.1x10-5 cm2/s) and of the identically composed mixed micellar solution (Da=2.9x10-5 cm2/s) was delayed compared with the data of the aqueous drug solution (Da=4.7x10-5 cm2/s). Because of the association of ibuprofen lysinate molecules with phospholipid molecules within the liposomal and the mixed micellar system the share of free ibuprofen lysinate monomers, which can pass through the dialysis membrane in the release experiment, is markedly reduced. The results of permeation experiments of these systems, however, did not correspond to the release data. The permeability of the mixed micellar solution rose after 6 weeks of storage (P=4.2x10-8 cm/s), and almost reached the permeation of the aqueous solution (P=3.9x10-8 cm/s), whereas the permeation of the liposomal dispersion was very slow (P=1.5x10-8 cm/s).

Threefold-ibuprofen-imprinted layers were constructed into and onto the MMMs-PTIs through the phase inversion process, followed by suction filtration strategy, in which the PDA-based ibuprofen-imprinted activated carbon (AC)/SiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>/GO were chosen as fillers. Based on the threefold-imprinted SiO<sub>2</sub>/AC and polymer and TiO<sub>2</sub>/GO-loaded structure, rebinding capacities and permselectivity of MMMs-PTIs had been successfully enhanced, and the selective recognition and separation mechanism had been finally evaluated based on the static adsorption/permeation results. Both high rebinding capacity (53.22 mg/g) and adsorption selectivity (α > 2.0) had been achieved. Importantly, as to the permselectivity performance of MMMs-PTIs toward different compounds, the ibuprofen-permeation efficiencies (β value) of MMMs-PTIs reached 4.07, 4.08, and 3.77, respectively.

We used surface plasmon resonance microscopy to study the pH-responsive behaviors of MIL-88B(Fe) film in real time. A dissociation constant of (6.10 ± 0.86) × 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> was measured for the MIL-88B(Fe) film in an acidic condition (pH 6.3), which is about 10 times higher than the dissociation of the same film in a neutral pH condition. MIL-88B(Fe) films are also capable of loading around 6.0 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> of ibuprofen, which was measured using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Drug release profiles were compared in both acidic and neutral pH conditions (pH 6.3 and 7.4) using a QCM cell to model the drug release in healthy body systems and those containing inflammatory tissues or cancerous tumors. It was found that the amount of drug released in acidic environments had been significantly higher compared to that in a neutral system within 55 h of testing time.

Artemisinin, a gift from traditional Chinese medicine, has been used in the treatment of malaria and has shown good therapeutic efficiency. However, due to its low solubility, poor bioavailability, and short half-life time, some smart delivery strategies are still required. Herein, a multifunctional DES prepared from ibuprofen and menthol was prepared. This DES was shown to efficiently promote the solubility of artemisinin up to 400-fold. Then, it was further applied as the oil phase to construct an O/W microemulsion with the help of Tween-80 + Span-20 mixed surfactants. The prepared microemulsion displayed high efficiency in improving the permeability of artemisinin, which can be ascribed to the presence of the permeation enhancer menthol in DES and the microstructure of the O/W microemulsion.

Cell-free tools used to predict membrane interactions should replicate the molecular organization of the membrane. Microcavity array-supported lipid bilayer (MSLB) platforms are versatile biophysical models of the cell membrane that combine liposome-like membrane fluidity with stability and addressability. We used an MSLB herein to interrogate drug-membrane interactions across seven drugs from different classes, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories: ibuprofen (Ibu) and diclofenac (Dic); antibiotics: rifampicin (Rif), levofloxacin (Levo), and pefloxacin (Pef); and bisphosphonates: alendronate (Ale) and clodronate (Clo). Fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (FLCS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to evaluate the impact of drug on 1,2-dioleyl- sn-glycerophosphocholine and binary bilayers over physiologically relevant drug concentrations. Although FLCS data revealed Ibu, Levo, Pef, Ale, and Clo had no impact on lipid lateral mobility, EIS, which is more sensitive to membrane structural change, indicated modest but significant decreases to membrane resistivity consistent with adsorption but weak penetration of drugs at the membrane. Ale and Clo, evaluated at pH 5.25, did not impact the impedance of the membrane except at concentrations exceeding 4 mM. Conversely, Dic and Rif dramatically altered bilayer fluidity, suggesting their translocation through the bilayer, and EIS data showed that resistivity of the membrane decreased substantially with increasing drug concentration. Capacitance changes to the bilayer in most cases were insignificant. Using a Langmuir-Freundlich model to fit the EIS data, we propose R<sub>sat</sub> as an empirical value that reflects permeation. Overall, the data indicate that Ibu, Levo, and Pef adsorb at the interface of the lipid membrane but Dic and Rif interact strongly, permeating the membrane core modifying the water/ion permeability of the bilayer structure.

Of these advantages, long-acting drug delivery is perhaps the most valuable. Hydrophilic compounds are particularly difficult to deliver for prolonged times. This work investigates the use of poly(caprolactone) (PCL)-based implant coatings as a novel strategy to prolong the delivery of hydrophilic compounds from implantable devices that have been prepared by additive manufacturing (AM). Hollow implants were prepared from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) using fused filament fabrication (FFF) AM and subsequently coated in a PCL-based coating. Coatings were prepared by solution-casting mixtures of differing molecular weights of PCL and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Increasing the proportion of low-molecular-weight PCL up to 60% in the formulations decreased the crystallinity by over 20%, melting temperature by over 4 °C, and water contact angle by over 40°, resulting in an increased degradation rate when compared to pure high-molecular-weight PCL. Addition of 30% PEG to the formulation increased the porosity of the formulation by over 50% when compared to an equivalent PCL-only formulation. These implants demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> release rates for hydrophilic model compounds (methylene blue and ibuprofen sodium) ranging from 0.01 to 34.09 mg/day, depending on the drug used. The versatility of the devices produced in this work and the range of release rates achievable show great potential.

The incorporation of additives, such as surfactants, during microneedle fabrication might be an alternative solution to overcome the limited range of materials used in fabricating dissolving MAPs. However, there is a lacuna in the knowledge on the effect of surfactants on the manufacture and performance of dissolving MAPs. The current study explores the role of surfactants in the manufacture and performance of dissolving MAPs fabricated from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) loaded with the model drugs, ibuprofen sodium and itraconazole. Three nonionic surfactants, Lutrol F108, Pluronic F88, and Tween 80, in solutions at varying concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% w/w) were loaded into these dissolving MAPs. It was discovered that all of the dissolving MAPs that incorporated surfactant displayed a lower reduction in the microneedle height (≈10%) relative to the control formulation (≈20%) when subjected to a compressive force of 32 N. In addition, the incorporation of surfactants in some instances enhanced the insertion profile of these polymeric MAPs when evaluated using <i>ex vivo</i> neonatal porcine skin. The incorporation of surfactant into ibuprofen sodium-loaded dissolving MAPs improved the insertion depth of MAPs from 400 μm down to 600 μm. However, such enhancement was not apparent when the MAPs were loaded with the model hydrophobic drug, itraconazole. Skin deposition studies highlighted that the incorporation of surfactant enhanced the delivery efficiency of both model drugs, ibuprofen sodium and itraconazole. The incorporation of surfactant enhanced the amount of ibuprofen sodium delivered from 60.61% up to ≈75% with a majority of the drug being delivered across the skin and into the receptor compartment. On the other hand, when surfactants were added into MAPs loaded with the model hydrophobic drug itraconazole, we observed enhancement in intradermal delivery efficiency from 20% up to 30%, although this did not improve the delivery of the drug across the skin. This work highlights that the addition of nonionic surfactant is an alternative formulation strategy worth exploring to improve the performance and delivery efficiency of dissolving MAPs.",2022,,"Anjani QK, Sabri AHB, Utomo E, Domínguez-Robles J, Donnelly RF.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.1c00988,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed methodology of permeation studies', 'Specific formulations used', 'Exact experimental conditions', 'Results on ibuprofen perfusion rates']","The study focuses on ibuprofen sodium delivery through dissolving MAPs with surfactants, relevant for in vitro permeation studies.

The system is similar to a related gelator system we had studied previously, but we were unable to apply the same gelling procedure because of the instability of the colloid caused by the small structural modification (length of the alkyl chain in the bis-imidazolium head group). This situation holds true for the gels formed with varying compositions and under different conditions (gelator/drug ratio, solvent proportion, and flow rates), with the most significant differences being the improved gel rheology and slower drug release rates. Very importantly, the gels (based on a previously unexplored system) have a higher water content ratio (water/EtOH 4:1) than others in the family, making their medicinal application more attractive. The gels were characterized by a variety of microscopy techniques, X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, and rheology. Salts of the antiinflammatory drugs ibuprofen and indomethacin were successfully incorporated into the gels. The diffraction experiments indicate that these composite gels with relatively short alkyl chains in the gelator component contrast to previous systems, in that they exhibit structural order and the presence of crystalline areas of the drug molecule implying partial phase separation (even though these drug crystallites are not discernible by microscopy). Furthermore, the release study with the gel incorporating ibuprofenate showed promising results that indicate a possible drug delivery vehicle application for this and related systems.",2017,,"Sathyanarayanan G, Rodrigues M, Limón D, Rodriguez-Trujillo R, Puigmartí-Luis J, Pérez-García L, Amabilino DB.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.7b01800,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,both,yes,yes,uncertain,"['detailed formulation information', 'specific release rates of ibuprofen', 'methods of permeation studies', 'comparison with conventional methods', 'stability of the gels under various conditions']","This study investigates the drug release profile of ibuprofen incorporated into gels using a microfluidic approach, indicating the relevance to permeation studies.

In this work, a combined experimental and computational investigation of the main structural and physicochemical parameters driving drug adsorption/desorption kinetics was carried out. Two model drugs (aspirin and ibuprofen) and three water-stable, biocompatible MOFs (MIL-100(Fe), UiO-66(Zr), and MIL-127(Fe)) have been selected to obtain a variety of drug-matrix couples with different structural and physicochemical characteristics. This study evidenced that the drug-loading and drug-delivery processes are mainly governed by structural parameters (accessibility of the framework and drug volume) as well as the MOF/drug hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. As a result, the delivery of the drug under simulated cutaneous conditions (aqueous media at 37 °C) demonstrated that these systems fulfill the requirements to be used as topical drug-delivery systems, such as released payload between 1 and 7 days. These results highlight the importance of the rational selection of MOFs, evidencing the effect of geometrical and chemical parameters of both the MOF and the drug on the drug adsorption and release.",2018,,"Rojas S, Colinet I, Cunha D, Hidalgo T, Salles F, Serre C, Guillou N, Horcajada P.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.8b00185,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",later,no,uncertain,yes,yes,skin,"[""Details on ibuprofen's release kinetics"", 'Formulation specifics relating to the MOFs used', 'Results of permeation studies under simulated conditions']","The study involves ibuprofen and addresses drug delivery under cutaneous conditions, making it relevant.

Both pristine and functionalized Zr-DASDCAs, together with activated carbon, were used as a potential carrier for ibuprofen (IBU) storage and delivery. Zr-DASDCAs, especially the modified ones (OC-Zr-DASDCA and TC-Zr-DASDCA), showed competitive results in IBU delivery. Specifically, the release rate in phosphate-buffered saline solution at pH 7.4 was nearly constant (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.98) for up to 10 days, which would be very effective in IBU dosing to the human body. Moreover, the release rate could be controlled by changing the pH of the releasing solution. The rate of IBU release from both pristine and modified Zr-DASDCAs at pH 7.4 and 3.0 was also explained with a few interactions such as H-bonding and electrostatic repulsion, together with the relative pore size of the Zr-DASDCAs. Therefore, the results suggested that functionalization of MOFs via postsynthetic modification, especially with OC and TC, to introduce various functional groups onto MOFs is an effective approach to not only reducing the release rate of IBU but also inducing a constant release of IBU for as long as 10 days.",2019,,"Sarker M, Shin S, Jhung SH.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b01139,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on the diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics on the ibuprofen formulation', 'Data on release kinetics', 'Comparative results of modified vs. pristine Zr-DASDCA', 'Methodology for measuring release rates']","The study evaluates a metal-organic framework for ibuprofen delivery, suggesting potential relevance for diffusion studies.

Here, we studied two types of Fe-MOFs: MIL-53 and MIL-88B, for in vitro drug loading and releasing of ibuprofen as a model drug. Both Fe-MOFs are based on the same iron clusters and organic ligands but form different crystal structures as a result of two different nucleation pathways. The MIL-53 structure demonstrates one-dimensional channels, while MIL-88B exhibits a three-dimensional cage structure. Our studies show that MIL-53 adsorbs more ibuprofen (37.0 wt %) compared to MIL-88B (19.5 wt %). A controlled drug release was observed in both materials with a slower elution pattern in the case of the ibuprofen-encapsulated MIL-88B. This indicates that a complex cage structure of MIL-88 is beneficial to control the rate of drug release. A linear correlation was found between cumulative drug release and the degree of material degradation, suggesting the biodegradation of Fe-MILs as the main drug elution mechanism. The cytotoxicity of MIL-88B was evaluated in vitro with NIH-3T3 Swiss mouse fibroblasts, and it shows that MIL-88B has no adverse effects on cell viability up to 0.1 mg/mL. This low toxicity was attributed to the morphology of MIL-88B nanocrystals. The very low toxicity and controlled drug release behavior of Fe-MIL-88B suggest that better materials for drug-delivery applications can be created by controlling not only the composition but also the crystal structure and nanoparticle morphology of the material.",2020,,"Pham H, Ramos K, Sua A, Acuna J, Slowinska K, Nguyen T, Bui A, Weber MDR, Tian F.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03696,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology of ibuprofen loading and release', 'Quantitative data on permeation rates', 'Chemical characterization of formulations', 'Comparison with other drug delivery systems', 'In vitro study conditions and parameters']","The study focuses on ibuprofen release using iron-based metal-organic frameworks, making it directly relevant for the dataset on drug permeation.

Multilayers composed of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and poly(styrene sulfonate) assembled at high pH (pH > 9.0) were first assembled into the pores of track-etched polycarbonate membranes, and then multilayers of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles and PAH were deposited. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the formation of multilayer nanotubes with an inner shell of magnetite nanoparticles. These tubes exhibited superparamagnetic characteristics at room temperature (300 K) as determined by a SQUID magnetometer. The surface of the magnetic nanotubes could be further functionalized by adsorbing poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(methacrylic acid) block copolymers. The separation and release behavior of low molecular weight anionic molecules (i.e., ibuprofen, rose bengal, and acid red 8) by/from the multilayer nanotubes were studied because these tubes could potentially be used as separation or targeted delivery vehicles. The magnetic tubes could be successfully used to separate (or remove) a high concentration of dye molecules (i.e., rose bengal) from solution by activating the nanotubes in acidic solution. The release of the anionic molecules in physiologically relevant buffer solution showed that whereas bulky molecules (e.g., rose bengal) release slowly, small molecules (i.e., ibuprofen) release rapidly from the multilayers.

Within this model study the impact of the matrix material on the film forming properties of ibuprofen-matrix composite films is investigated. As matrix materials polystyrene, methyl cellulose, or hydroxyl-ethyl cellulose were used. The film properties were either varied by the preparation route, i.e., spin coating or drop casting, or via changes in the relative ratio of the ibuprofen and the matrix material. The resulting films were investigated via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscope experiments. The results show that preferred (100) textures can be induced via spin coating with respect to the glass surface, while the drop casting results in a powder-like behavior. The morphologies of the films are strongly impacted by the ibuprofen amount rather than the preparation method. A comparison of the various matrix materials in terms of their impact on the dissolution properties show a two times faster zero order release from methyl cellulose matrix compared to a polystyrene matrix. The slowest rate was observed within the hydroxyl ethyl cellulose as the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) release is limited by diffusion through a swollen matrix. The investigation reveals that the ibuprofen crystallization and film formation is only little effected by the selected matrix material than that compared to the dissolution.

A diffusion cell was modified so ultrasound could be applied to the vehicle and skin. Since ultrasound can increase the temperature underneath the area of application, control representing temperature effects ran concurrently to the ultrasound experiment. The results demonstrate that ultrasound can increase the penetration of ibuprofen through human skin.

The use of the major family of metals as matrices for sustained release is, to the best of our knowledge, unknown. In this context we describe a new family of bio-composites for sustained release of drugs, namely analgesic drugs entrapped within metallic silver. Synthetic methodologies were developed for the preparation of ibuprofen@Ag, naproxen@Ag, tramadol@Ag and bupivacaine@Ag composites. Detailed kinetic analysis of the release of the drugs from within the metal, is provided, demonstrating that metals can indeed serve as reservoirs for drug release. The metal in our case acts not only as a drug releasing source, but also as an antibacterial agent and this property of the composites was studied. Unexpectedly, it was found that the entrapment of the analgesics within silver, dramatically enhances the growth inhibition activity of wild type Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exceeding by far the inhibition activity of the separate components.

Yet, their transferability from bench to bedside is still a challenge as it hits many barriers. Among them, the absence of a clear design made on the deeper understanding of the intermolecular forces underlying the formation of the drug-carrier system and the controlled release of the drug is relevant. In this contribution, we rationally designed and prepared lipid-based formulations of an anticancer drug, fluorouracil (FU - hydrophilic) and an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen (IBU - hydrophobic) to thoroughly characterize the specific intermolecular interactions between drugs and components of the carrier matrix. Microemulsions (ME) were selected as the main carriers for this study, but a comparison with liposomes was performed to observe if different organization of the lipophilic and hydrophilic compartments influences the loading capacity and controlled release of these two drugs. Using Maisine CC, a biocompatible oil, and Tween 20 as the surfactant, normal oil-in-water ME loaded with FU and IBU (1:1, 1:3, 1:6, wt:wt) were prepared by the water titration method. MEs were characterized by DLS, Zeta potential, and DOSY spectroscopies to assess their droplet size, surface charge, structure and type of emulsion. Intermolecular interactions between drugs and components of the ME's matrix were investigated by FT-IR, RAMAN and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopies. The experimental results of DOSY revealed that all components of MEs are gathered in normal oil-in-water ME. Due to their different affinities for the main components of the ME, FU, and IBU were mainly distributed in the aqueous and oily phases, respectively, as supported by the droplet size measured by DLS. It was observed that co-loading the two drugs impacted the release behavior, assessed by the dialysis bag method, as compared with the mono-drug formulations. Based on the findings of this work, a release mechanism for FU and IBU was proposed, as well. Overall, the ME proved to be more suitable nanocarriers since the drugs, which were loaded in higher amounts as compared to liposomes, followed a controlled and sustained release of at least 96 h.",2025,,"Nistor M, Nicolescu A, Amarandi RM, Pui A, Stiufiuc RI, Dragoi B.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-89540-w,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed formulation information', 'Specifics on diffusion cell setup', 'Release rates of ibuprofen', 'Impact of formulation variables on permeation']","The study directly involves ibuprofen in lipid-based formulations and assesses release behavior, making it relevant for permeation analysis.

Spinal prostanoids are implicated in the development of thermal hyperalgesia after peripheral injury, but the specific prostanoid species that are involved are presently unknown. The current study used an in vitro spinal superfusion model to investigate the effect of substance P (SP), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), and capsaicin on multiple prostanoid release from dorsal spinal cord of naive rats as well as rats that underwent peripheral injury and inflammation (knee joint kaolin/carrageenan). 2. In naive rat spinal cords, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha, but not TxB2, levels were increased after inclusion of SP, NMDA, or capsaicin in the perfusion medium. 3. Basal PGE2 levels from spinal cords of animals that underwent 5-72 h of peripheral inflammation were elevated relative to age-matched naive cohorts. The time course of this increase in basal PGE2 levels coincided with peripheral inflammation, as assessed by knee joint circumference. Basal 6-keto-PGF1alpha levels were not elevated after injury. 4. From this inflammation-evoked increase in basal PGE2 levels, SP and capsaicin significantly increased spinal PGE2 release in a dose-dependent fashion. Capsaicin-evoked increases were blocked dose-dependently by inclusion of S(+) ibuprofen in the capsaicin-containing perfusate. 5.

Thus, a crack-free and uniform MOF membrane with high performance was successfully obtained. In this case, 2-methylimidazole was believed to react with ZnO to form uniform ZIF nuclei, which induced and guided the growth of ZIF-8 membrane. The as-prepared ZIF-8 membrane had large surface area and good thermal stability.

To overcome these limitations, we used molecular design to create therapeutic methacrylic (TMA) monomers to impart tunable mechanical properties, decreased formaldehyde release, and covalently-controlled bioactivity to commercial cyanoacrylate adhesives. The small molecule therapeutics ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and benzocaine were covalently tethered to the carbonyl of methacrylate using anhydride, ester, and amide bonds. When these TMAs were incorporated into n-butyl cyanoacrylate (BCA) tissue adhesives, the resulting TMA-BCA materials provided release of the therapeutics across a range of time scales according to the reactivity of the tether bond to hydrolysis. The anhydride-tether TMA-BCA adhesive delivered ibuprofen on the same order of magnitude and time scale as topical medications (12 ± 6 mg per g adhesive after 3.4 h). TMA-BCA adhesives also produced less formaldehyde than standard BCA adhesive, showed promising cytocompatibility, and adhered effectively to porcine skin. Further, the anhydride, ester, and amide tether TMA-BCA adhesives exhibited a range of shear moduli, with those containing rigid aromatic amide groups being stiffer, and those with flexible alkyl segments being less stiff, which could enable these adhesives to be tailored to match the mechanical properties of target tissues.

Three-dimensional scaffolds that can control the release of anti-inflammatory agents over time and space offer a promising approach to regulate the immune response while providing structural support during healing. In this study, we developed an electrospun biomimetic scaffold incorporating ibuprofen-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with an ultrasound-responsive alginate coating. Optimal parameters for safe and non-invasive ultrasound stimulation (<i>i.e.</i>, frequency, intensity, and duration) were identified to induce weakening of the interaction among the alginate chains, enabling on-demand drug release from the nanoparticles. <i>In vitro</i> studies with human macrophages confirmed the biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory efficacy of the nanoparticles at concentrations up to 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The results demonstrated that ultrasound stimulation further amplified the therapeutic effect even at very low concentrations (≥0.05 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) of the tested nanoparticle suspensions. The electrospinning process was optimised to produce nanoparticle-containing polyvinylidene fluoride nanofibers that are aligned and piezoelectric, mimicking the architecture and electroactivity of native tissues. The resulting scaffold exhibited excellent biocompatibility and effectively reduced inflammatory markers <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, controlled ibuprofen release from the scaffold was successfully triggered on-demand through repeated ultrasound stimulations, applied up to seven days after immersion.

In this study, the combination of attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopic imaging with specifically designed polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices to study drug release from pharmaceutical formulations has been developed. First, the high-throughput analysis of the dissolution of micro-formulations studied under flowing conditions has been introduced using a model formulation of ibuprofen and polyethylene glycol. The behaviour and release of the drug was monitored in situ under different pH conditions. In contrast to the neutral solution, where both the drug and excipient dissolved at a similar rate, structural change from the molecularly dispersed to a crystalline form of ibuprofen was characterised in the obtained spectroscopic images and the corresponding ATR-FTIR spectra for the experiments carried out in the acidic medium. Further investigations into the behaviour of the drug after its release from formulations (i.e., dissolved drug) were also undertaken. Different solutions of sodium ibuprofen dissolved in a neutral medium were studied upon contact with acidic conditions. The phase transition from a dissolved species of sodium ibuprofen to the formation of solid crystalline ibuprofen was revealed in the microfluidic channels. This innovative approach could offer a promising platform for high-throughput analysis of a range of micro-formulations, which are of current interest due to the advent of 3D printed pharmaceutical and microparticulate delivery systems.

The objective of this study was to characterize transmembrane permeation of ibuprofen and sunscreen oxybenzone across poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) membrane. In vitro diffusion studies were carried out at 37 degrees and 45 degrees C, using a series of ibuprofen and oxybenzone samples, either individually or in combination. Concentrations of ibuprofen and oxybenzone in the receptor compartment for up to 6 h were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Ibuprofen and oxybenzone permeated across the PDMS membrane in all diffusion studies. When applied individually, permeation percentages of ibuprofen and oxybenzone ranged from 1.0 to 4.1% and from 13.2 to 25.8%, respectively. When applied in combination, permeation percentages of ibuprofen and oxybenzone were 0.3-1.4% and 7.8-24.3%, respectively.

Here, we explored the anti-adhesive and inflammatory capacities of PEG/silk and Ibuprofen-loaded PEG/Silk core-shell nanofibrous membranes, respectively. The ibuprofen-loaded Silk Fibroin-Poly ethylene Glycol (SF-PEG) core-shell membrane was fabricated by electrospinning and considered in terms of morphology, surface wettability, drug release, and degradation. To reveal the membrane capability for adhesion bands inhibition, the membrane was stitched among the abdominal partition and peritoneum and then evaluated using two scoring adhesion systems. According to results, the fibrous membrane hindered cell proliferation, and the scoring systems and pathology showed that in a rat model, Ibuprofen-loaded PEG/Silk core-shell membrane caused a lightening in post-operative adhesion bands and the low-grade inflammatory reaction in animal models.

The dissolution study of ibuprofen delivered by poloxamer gels composed of poloxamer 188 and menthol were performed. In the absence of poloxamer, the solubility of ibuprofen increased until the ratio of menthol to ibuprofen increased from 0:10 to 4:6, followed by an abrupt decrease in solubility above the ratio of 4:6, indicating that 4 parts of ibuprofen formed eutectic mixture with 6 parts of menthol. In the presence of poloxamer 188, the solutions with the same ratio of menthol to ibuprofen showed abrupt increase in the solubility of ibuprofen. Furthermore, the solution with ratio of 4:6 showed more than 2.5- and 6-fold increase in the solubility of ibuprofen compared with that without poloxamer and that without menthol, respectively. The poloxamer gel with menthol/ibuprofen ratio of 1:9 and higher than 15% poloxamer 188 showed the maximum solubility of ibuprofen, 1.2 mg/ml. Menthol improved the dissolution rates of ibuprofen from poloxamer gels. Dissolution mechanism showed that the dissolution rate of ibuprofen from the poloxamer gels without menthol was independent of the time, but the drug might be dissolved from the poloxamer gels with menthol by Fickian diffusion. Thus, the poloxamer gels developed using eutectic mixture with menthol, which gave the improved solubility and dissolution of drug, are potential candidates for ibuprofen-loaded transdermal and rectal delivery system.",2003,,"Yong CS, Jung SH, Rhee JD, Choi HG, Lee BJ, Kim DC, Choi YW, Kim CK.",https://doi.org/10.1080/713840406,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,uncertain,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics on the measured permeability rates', 'Further characterization of the poloxamer gel formulation', 'Comparative studies involving Franz diffusion cells']","The study investigates the solubility and dissolution of ibuprofen in a gel formulation, which is relevant for permeation studies.

MED,12476874,12476874.0,10.1081/ddc-120015362,Effect of fatty acid diesters on permeation of anti-inflammatory drugs through rat skin.,"Four fatty acid diesters (diethyl succinate, diethyl adipate, diethyl sebacate, and diisopropyl adipate) were used to study their enhancement effect on the permeation of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs: ketoprofen, indomethacin, diclofenac sodium, and ibuprofen) through rat abdominal skin. With the diester pretreatment, drug permeation increased and the lag times decreased. No relationship was observed between the solubilities of the drugs in the diesters and the diester enhancement effects. The enhancement effect decreased with an increase of the drug lipophilicity, but increased with an increase of the lipophilic index of the diester up to about 3.5, after which the enhancement effect decreased or remained constant. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was employed to investigate the biophysical changes in the stratum corneum lipids caused by the diesters. The FTIR results showed that treatment of the skin with diesters did not produce a blue shift in the asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching peak positions. However, all of the above diesters showed a decrease in peak heights and areas for both asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching absorbances in comparison with water treatment. These results suggested that the diesters were more effective for enhancing the penetration of hydrophilic drugs than lipophilic drugs, and the enhancing effect of lipophilic diesters was more effective than that of hydrophilic diesters. The enhancement effects of diesters may be due to their causing lipid extraction in the skin.",2002,,"Takahashi K, Sakano H, Numata N, Kuroda S, Mizuno N.",https://doi.org/10.1081/ddc-120015362,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,no,skin,"['Detailed methodology of permeation studies', 'Quantitative results of ibuprofen permeation', 'Comparison with previous studies on permeation', 'Any formulation details of the diesters used']","The study focuses on the permeation of ibuprofen through rat skin using different diesters, providing both measurable endpoints and relevant comparisons in drug permeation.

In the present study, application of three types of water-soluble additives, namely polyethylene glycols (PEG 400, 3350, and 8000), maltodextrins (Maltrin M150, M100, and M040 in the order of lower to higher average polymer size and molecular weight; dextrose equivalence 16.9, 11.1, and 4.8, respectively), and xylitol, as porosity modifiers in the films of a commercially available aqueous ethylcellulose dispersion (Surelease/E-7-7060 plasticized with glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate) was investigated. The effect of type and level of these additives on drug release characteristics and surface and mechanical properties of the polymeric films was studied. Each additive was incorporated at 20 and 30% levels in the polymeric dispersion based on its solids content. Ibuprofen tablets were coated using the polymeric dispersion with and without additive at 3% w/w coat level in a fluid-bed equipment. The coated tablets were evaluated for their drug release rate, coat reflectivity (gloss), Brinell hardness, and elastic modulus. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis of the films was performed to determine the physico-chemical changes in the applied film-coats.

Using menthol and aqueous isopropanol (IPA) as melting point depressing agents, the two-phase melt systems (TMSs) of Ibu consisting of a homogeneous oily phase and a homogeneous aqueous phase were obtained. In TMS with a high S-Ibu: menthol ratio and a low IPA content, the oily phase primarily consisted of Ibu and menthol, whereas the majority of the aqueous phase was IPA and buffer. Using this method, the S-Ibu concentration in the oily phase reached as high as 70% (w/w). The compositional phase diagram was obtained using a titration method to study the relationship between the melting states of the solid components and system composition. S- and RS-Ibu showed different phase diagrams, and the maximum concentration of S-Ibu measured in the oily phase of TMS was much greater than that of RS-Ibu. The permeation study of a series of TMS and non-TMS systems showed that S-Ibu penetrated through shed snake skin faster than RS-Ibu, and the contents of IPA and menthol significantly affected the permeation rates of ibuprofen across shed snake skin, which may be attributed to the higher lipophilicity, and thus, higher solubility of S-Ibu in the skin than RS-Ibu.

Clinical studies with eye drop solutions have shown that a mixture of diverse comfort agents selected to address multiple propagators of discomfort provide the greatest and longest lasting sensations of comfort for the patient. In this paper, multiple propagators of discomfort are addressed through the simultaneous release of four molecules from a novel contact lens to ensure high level of lens wear comfort.<h4>Methods</h4>Silicone hydrogel contact lenses were engineered via molecular imprinting strategies to simultaneously release up to four template molecules including hydropropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), trehalose, ibuprofen, and prednisolone.<h4>Results</h4>By adjusting the ratio of functional monomer to comfort molecule, a high level of control was demonstrated over the release rate. HPMC, trehalose, ibuprofen, and prednisolone were released at therapeutically relevant concentrations with varying rates from a single lens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate use as daily disposable lenses for single day release or extended-wear lenses with multiple day release.

To obtain direct evidence of abnormal eicosanoid biosynthesis in rats injected with anti-glomerular-basement-membrane antibodies (a-GBM), products derived from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) were measured in 24 h urine collections before and after a-GBM. 2. Administration of a-GBM (9.5 mg) caused albuminuria, decreased creatinine clearance, increased numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and increased excretion of TXB2, 2,3-dinor-TXB2 (products of TXA2) and 6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF 1 alpha (products of PGI2) at 24 h. 3. Interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta; 5 micrograms) alone caused an increase in PGI2 metabolite excretion but had no effect on TXA2 metabolites. It had no effect on creatinine clearance but increased numbers of glomerular neutrophils by approximately 4-5 fold compared to a-GBM. 4. Pretreatment of rats with IL-1 beta before a-GBM synergistically increased albumin excretion but only additively increased eicosanoid excretion. Numbers of intra-glomerular neutrophils and creatinine clearance were unchanged compared to IL-1 beta alone. 5. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (10 mgkg-1 i.p., twice daily for 4 days) inhibited both serum TXB2 production and urinary prostaglandin excretion. It also caused an almost complete attenuation of albumin excretion. Creatinine clearance and glomerular neutrophils remained unchanged after a-GBM/IL-1 beta. 6. We conclude that the 50% inhibition of thromboxane production induced by ibuprofen does not modify the fall in creatinine clearance of accumulation of neutrophils in the glomerulus caused by the a-GBM. This degree of inhibition of eicosanoid production was associated with a striking decrease in proteinuria, but this may reflect a haemodynamic rather than a disease modifying action.",1991,,"Ward PS, Fuller RW, Ritter JM, Cashman SJ, Rees AJ, Dollery CT.",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1991.tb09844.x,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details about ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific methods of measuring permeability', 'Endpoints related to permeation', 'Data on diffusion cell setup']","The study investigates the effects of ibuprofen on urinary eicosanoid excretion and kidney function, indicating a direct relevance to in vitro permeation studies.

Absorption of flurbiprofen was similar from 10 and 100% saturated aqueous solutions, suggesting that the skin has a limited capacity for flurbiprofen transport beyond which further increase in drug penetration may be difficult. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone enhanced the penetration flux of ibuprofen sixteenfold and flurbiprofen, over threefold.

The molecular packing of these various systems was also investigated in Langmuir monolayer studies.<h4>Key findings</h4>Loading and release of drugs within the liposome bilayer was shown to be influenced by their cholesterol content: increasing cholesterol content was shown to reduce drug incorporation and inclusion of cholesterol in the bilayer changed the release profile of propofol from zero-order, for phosphatidyl choline only liposomes, to a first-order model when 11 to 33 total molar % of cholesterol was present in the formulation. At higher bilayer concentrations substitution of cholesterol with tetradecanol was shown to have less of a detrimental impact on bilayer drug loading. However, the presence of cholesterol within the liposome bilayer was shown to reduce drug release compared with fatty alcohols. Monolayer studies undertaken showed that effective mean area per molecule for a 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC):cholesterol mixture deviated by 9% from the predicted area compared with 5% with a similar DSPC:tetradecanol mixture. This evidence, combined with cholesterol being a much more bulky structure, indicated that the condensing influence of tetradecanol was less compared with cholesterol, thus supporting the reduced impact of tetradecanol on drug loading and drug retention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Liposomes can be effectively formulated using fatty alcohols as an alternative bilayer stabiliser to cholesterol. The general similarities in the characteristics of liposomes containing fatty alcohols or cholesterol suggest a common behavioural influence for both compounds within the bilayer.",2010,,"Ali MH, Kirby DJ, Mohammed AR, Perrie Y.",https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-pdf/62/11/1646/36352669/j.2042-7158.2010.01090.x.pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",later,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Specific data on ibuprofen release rates', 'Comparative analysis of formulation with and without cholesterol', 'Detailed methodology of drug loading in liposomes']","The study investigates drug release from liposomal formulations, including ibuprofen, but does not clearly focus on the Franz diffusion cell methodology.

From a pharmacological perspective, topical application of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the form of film wound dressings may be a good choice. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop novel layered film wound dressings containing ibuprofen based on partially substituted fibrous sodium carboxymethylcellulose (nonwoven textile Hcel NaT). To this end, an innovative solvent casting method using a sequential coating technique has been applied. The concentration of ibuprofen which was incorporated as an acetone solution or as a suspension in a sodium carboxymethylcellulose dispersion was 0.5 mg/cm(2) and 1.0 mg/cm(2) of film. Results showed that developed films had adequate mechanical and swelling properties and an advantageous acidic surface pH for wound application. An in vitro drug release study implied that layered films retained the drug for a longer period of time and thus could minimize the frequency of changing the dressing.

In the present study, we have investigated systematically the influence of increasing amounts of the cosolvent ethanol on the solubility, ionization, and permeability characteristics of ibuprofen in silicone and in skin. The possibility of ibuprofen self-association was also examined. As the amount of ethanol was raised from 0 to 100%, ibuprofen solubility was enhanced 5,500-fold relative to its aqueous solubility. Up to 50%, the pK(a) of ibuprofen shifted from 4.44 to 5.68. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of ibuprofen in both monomer and dimer forms in vehicles containing 75 and 100% ethanol. In silicone membranes, the flux of ibuprofen increased 8-fold over the range of ethanol concentrations studied (0-100%) relative to aqueous solutions, with the highest flux observed for 100% ethanol. However, in skin, the flux of ibuprofen was optimal for 50:50 and 75:25 ethanol-water vehicles (>10-fold flux enhancement).

Propylene glycol (PG) has a long history of use as a component of topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations. In the present study we investigated the influence of PG on the solubility and membrane permeability characteristics of ibuprofen in silicone and skin using binary (PG:water) and ternary (ethanol:PG:water) solvent systems. Fluxes were maximum for 70:30 PG:water systems in silicone membrane; however, for experiments conducted with skin, the flux of ibuprofen systematically increased with increasing amounts of PG. For silicone membrane, the flux values of ibuprofen from ternary ethanol:PG:water (25:25:50 and 50:25:25) systems were 1.2- and 1.5-fold higher than the highest values observed from the PG:water systems. A comparison of the data from occluded versus non-occluded studies suggested that the ethanol content was the critical determinant of flux enhancement in these systems. For human skin, a PG:water (50:50) mixture enhanced ibuprofen flux to the same extent as the corresponding ethanol:PG:water (25:25:50) system. However, the ternary system, ethanol:PG:water (50:25:25), demonstrated the greatest enhancement. An analysis of the partition and diffusion parameters for experiments conducted with skin confirmed that the influence of PG in the PG:water systems is primarily on the solubility and partitioning behaviour of ibuprofen.

In addition, the <i>in vitro</i> release profile of IBF in acid and basic media was analyzed during 96 h. The IBF-NRL membrane exhibited the absence of intermolecular bonding that could hinder drug release and presented compatible mechanical properties for applications as a cutaneous adhesive (0.58 and 1.12 MPa to Young's modulus and rupture tension, respectively). The IBF-NRL system did not present a significant hemolysis degree (1.67%) within 24 h.

The flux of the hydrophilic compounds diclofenac and paracetamol (logK(ow) < 1, melting point > 100°C) increased their amount by four (200 μm) to eight (300 μm), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Commercially available microneedle rollers with 200-300 μm long needles enhance the drug delivery of topically applied non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and represent a valuable tool for percutaneous permeation enhancement particularly for substances with poor permeability due to a hydrophilic nature and high melting points.",2012,,"Stahl J, Wohlert M, Kietzmann M.",https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/2050-6511-13-5,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,no,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation', 'Specific experimental conditions', 'Complete data on permeation rates', 'Comparison metrics with other compounds']","The study directly examines ibuprofen's permeation through Franz-type diffusion cells, providing valuable insights into its permeability enhancement.

In this research, magnetic@layered double hydroxide multicore@shell nanostructure was synthesized by the facile experiment and is used as novel drug nanocarrier.<h4>Methods</h4>Magnetic nanospheres were synthesized by a facile one-step solvothermal route, and then, layered double hydroxide nanoflakes were prepared on the magnetic nanospheres by coprecipitation experiment. The synthesized nanostructures were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, VSM, and TEM, respectively. After intercalation with Ibuprofen and Diclofenac as anti-inflammatory drugs and using exchange anion experiment, the basal spacing of synthesized layered double hydroxides was compared with brucite nanosheets from 0.48 nm to 2.62 nm and 2.22 nm, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>The results indicated that Ibuprofen and Diclofenac were successfully intercalated into the interlay space of LDHs via bridging bidentate interaction. In addition, in-vitro drug release experiments in pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) showed constant release profiles with Ibuprofen and Diclofenac as model drugs with different lipophilicity, water solubility, size, and steric effect.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LDH-ibuprofen and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@LDH-diclofenac had the advantage of the strong interaction between the carboxyl groups with higher trivalent cations by bridging bidentate, clarity, and high thermal stability.

The influence of the concentration of ibuprofen in the film coating and the effect of the coating level on drug release from coated beads was determined in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer solution. The influence of storage time at 23 degrees C and 60 degrees C on the release of ibuprofen from coated beads was also investigated. The thermal properties of the films were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to image the surface morphology of the coated beads. Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of Eudragit RS 30 D and ibuprofen. Results from the dissolution studies demonstrated that increasing the amount of ibuprofen in the polymeric film reduced the rate of drug release, mainly because of a more complete coalescence of the polymeric particles of the latex dispersion. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of Eudragit RS 30 D films decreased and the surface of the coated beads became smoother as the concentration of ibuprofen was increased. Hydrogen bonding between the polymer and ibuprofen was demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. No significant differences were found in drug dissolution between the coated beads stored at 23 degrees C for 12 months and those stored at 60 degrees C for 12 hours. The results of this study demonstrated that the ibuprofen plasticized the Eudragit RS 30 D. Furthermore, the dissolution rate of ibuprofen can be controlled and changes in the drug release rate can be minimized by using the drug-induced plasticization technique with this polymer.",2001,,"Wu C, McGinity JW.",https://doi.org/10.1208/pt020424,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology for drug release measurement', 'Specific details about diffusion cells used', 'Any comparison with Franz diffusion cell data', 'Information on permeation rates or barriers tested']","The study examines the release of ibuprofen from coated beads, likely involving diffusion principles relevant to permeation studies.

Ibuprofen was used as a representative drug for anhydride derivatization. Conjugates of ibuprofen with carboxylic acid moieties of different acrylic polymers were prepared by dehydration reaction using acetic anhydride. Products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy followed by preparation of microspheres with different sizes from the conjugate Eudragit L-100-ibuprofen. The drug release was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ibuprofen was bound to the polymers via an anhydride bond in high reaction yields (75-95%) with drug loading of up to 30% (w/w). These anhydride derivatives hydrolyzed and release the drug at different periods ranging from 1 to 5 days, depending on the hydrophobicity and the cross-linking of the conjugates.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of a series of lactate esters as penetration enhancers on the in vitro skin permeation of four drugs with different physicochemical properties, including ibuprofen, salicylic acid, dexamethasone and 5-fluorouracil. The saturated donor solutions of the evaluated drugs in propylene glycol were used in order to keep a constant driving force with maximum thermodynamic activity. The permeability coefficient (K(p)), skin concentration of drugs (SC), and lag time (T), as well as the enhancement ratios for K(p) and SC were recorded. All results indicated that lactate esters can exert a significant influence on the transdermal delivery of the model drugs and there is a structure-activity relationship between the tested lactate esters and their enhancement effects. The results also suggested that the lactate esters with the chain length of fatty alcohol moieties of 10-12 are more effective enhancers. Furthermore, the enhancement effect of lactate esters increases with a decrease of the drug lipophilicity, which suggests that they may be more efficient at enhancing the penetration of hydrophilic drugs than lipophilic drugs. The influence of the concentration of lactate esters was evaluated and the optimal concentration is in the range of 5-10 wt.%.

Unfortunately, this type of testing often yields permeation data that suffer from poor reproducibility. Moreover, this feature frequently occurs when synthetic membranes are used as barriers, in which case biological tissue-associated variability has been removed as an artefact of total variation. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the influence of a full-validation protocol on the performance of a tailor-made array of Franz diffusion cells (GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, UK) available in our laboratory. To this end, ibuprofen was used as a model hydrophobic drug while synthetic membranes were used as barriers. The parameters investigated included Franz cell dimensions, stirring conditions, membrane type, membrane treatment, temperature regulation and sampling frequency. It was determined that validation dramatically reduced derived data variability as the coefficient of variation for steady-state ibuprofen permeation from a gel formulation was reduced from 25.7% to 5.3% (n = 6).

Several attempts have been reported to improve the permeability of poorly soluble drug compounds using supersaturated systems. However, due to thermodynamic challenges, there was a high tendency for the drug to nucleate immediately after formulating or even during storage. The present study focuses on the efficiency of nanoparticles and influence of different concentrations of solubilizer such as vitamin E TPGS (D-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) to improve the permeation rate through the skin. Effects of several formulation factors were studied on the nanosuspension systems using ibuprofen as a model drug.

Five organic acids with different physicochemical properties, benzoic acid (BA), ibuprofen (IB), salicylic acid (SA), benzenesulfonic acid (BSA), and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), were employed as counter-ions to regulate the permeation rate of ESP across the rabbit abdominal skin in vitro.

Ketoprofen (KTP) and ibuprofen (IBU) were used as two separate model drugs. Eudragit S100 (ES100) was the matrix-forming agent, and ethyl cellulose (EC) (2.5 and 5%) was the release-retarding agent. A 16-mm extruder was used to develop the CTDDS to pilot scale. The obtained extrudate strands were transparent, indicating that the drugs were homogeneously dispersed in the matrix in an amorphous form, confirmed by both differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. The strands were pelletized into 1, 2, and 3 mm size pellets. A 100% drug release from 1, 2, and 3 mm pellets with 2.5% EC was observed at 12, 14, and 16 h, whereas the drug release was sustained for 14, 16, and 22 h from 5% EC pellets, respectively, for KTP. The release characteristics of IBU were similar to those of KTP with modest variations in release at lag time. The in vitro drug release study conducted in three-stage dissolution media showed a desired lag time of 6 h. The percent drug release from 1, 2, and 3 mm pellets with 40% drug load showed < 20% release from all formulations at 6 h.

Therefore, the in vitro permeation of excised porcine ear skin by drugs with different polarities [aminopyrine (AMP), antipyrine (ANP), methylparaben (MP), and ibuprofen (IP)] was analyzed under a constant skin surface temperature with different temperatures and humidities to reveal the effects of temperature and humidity on the skin permeation enhancement effects. Applied formulations were prepared by mixing the drug and a hydrophilic vehicle containing glycerin. The disposition-distance profiles of water and the humectant glycerin in the stratum corneum were also investigated using confocal Raman microscopy. High absolute humidity (AH) significantly contributed to the high skin penetration of the hydrophilic penetrants AMP, ANP, and MP but not the hydrophobic penetrant IP. An increase in the partition parameter and a decrease in the diffusivity parameter occurred with an increase in AH, independent of drug polarity. Moreover, we found that dew condensation induced by high AH on temperature-controlled skin surface may effectively increase water content and may provide higher glycerin distribution in the skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Increasing the amount of water and hydrophilic vehicles such as glycerin in the stratum corneum may enhance the permeation of hydrophilic penetrants AMP, ANP, and MP.

Ibuprofen is a commonly used anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic drug; however, because of its short biological half-life, it must be frequently administered orally and is highly irritating to the digestive tract. To prepare a novel transdermal delivery system for ibuprofen, a microemulsion was used as a drug carrier and dispersed in a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (ME/Gel) to increase percutaneous drug absorption while avoiding gastrointestinal tract irritation. The prepared microemulsion had a droplet size of ~ 90 nm, and the microemulsion had good stability in the hydrogel. Rheological tests revealed that the ME/Gel is a pseudoplastic fluid with decreased viscosity and increased shear rate. It displayed a certain viscoelasticity, and the microemulsion distribution displayed minor effects on the rheological characteristics of the hydrogel system. There was no significant difference in the rheology of the ME/Gel at 25°C and 32°C (normal skin surface temperature), which is beneficial for clinical application. Drug transdermal flux was significantly higher than that of the hydrogel and commercial cream groups (p < 0.01). The 24-h cumulative drug permeation amount was 1.42-fold and 2.52-fold higher than that of the hydrogel and cream groups, respectively.

The hydrogen bond networks and internal chemistry structures of the DESs were measured by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and <sup>1</sup>H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR), which demonstrated the successful synthesis of DESs. The viscosity of DES was decreased from 10,324.9 to 3219.6 mPa s, while glass transition temperature (Tg) of the DESs was increased from - 60.8 to - 51.4 °C, as the added water was increased from 45 to 60%. The solubility of ibuprofen, norfloxacin, and nateglinide in DES with 45% of water were increased by 79.3, 44.1, and 3.2 times higher than that in water, respectively. The vitro study of transdermal absorption of lidocaine in DESs showed that the cumulative amounts of lidocaine reached 252.4 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>, 226.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and 286.1 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> at 8 h for DESs with 45%, 50%, and 60% of water, respectively.

The aim of this study to develop emulgel and nanostructured lipid carrier NLC-based gel formulations containing ibuprofen, evaluate their mechanical properties, bioadhesive value and ex-vivo rabbit skin permeability. All formulations showed non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior and their viscosity values are suitable for topical application. The particle size of the nanostructured lipid carrier system was found to be 468 ± 21 nm, and the encapsulation efficiency was 95.58 ± 0.41%. According to the index of viscosity, consistency, firmness, and cohesiveness values obtained as a result of the back extrusion study, E2 formulation was found to be more suitable for transdermal application. The firmness and work of shear values of the E2 formulation, which has the highest viscosity value, were also found to be the highest and it was chosen as the most suitable formulation in terms of the spreadability test. The work of bioadhesion values of NLC-based gel and IBU-loaded NLC-based gel were found as 0.226 ± 0.028 and 0.181 ± 0.006 mJ/cm2 respectively. The percentages of IBU that penetrated through rabbit skin from the Ibuactive-Cream and the E2 were 87.4 ± 2.11% and 93.4 ± 2.72% after 24 h, respectively. When the penetration of ibuprofen through the skin was evaluated, it was found that the E2 formulation increased penetration due to its lipid and nanoparticle structure.

The solubility of ibuprofen sodium was determined at a range of pH values. Saturated solutions were then used to determine the influence of pH on diffusion across PDMS as a model membrane. The apparent partition coefficient of ibuprofen sodium between n-octanol and phosphate buffer at various pH values was also investigated. Organic salts of ibuprofen using ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine and ethylene diamine as counter-ions were synthesized and the influence of these counter-ions on the permeation of ibuprofen was studied. The presence of ion-pairing was confirmed using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Diffusion studies at different pH values (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0) indicated that ibuprofen sodium flux increased significantly with increasing pH from 4.0 to 7.0. Above pH 7.0 a decrease in diffusion was observed. The permeability coefficient increased with an increase in the amount of unionized acid. The apparent partition coefficient was directly related to the steady-state flux. The steady-state flux of ibuprofen increased up to 16-fold using different counter-ions. The highest flux was measured from ibuprofen triethylamine. The flux of ibuprofen salts across a lipophilic membrane can be increased by formation of ion-pairs.

The permeability of all drugs was remarkably increased by the treatment of skin with EtOH/Panasate 800 binary systems compared with either EtOH or Panasate 800 alone, and the effect reached a maximum in EtOH/Panasate 800 (40/60) system. With regard to this binary system, the skin permeation ratio or flux of the drug increased in the following order: salicyluric acid (SU) > salicylic acid (SA) > alclofenac (ALC) > ketoprofen (KP) > ibuprofen (IBU). The one-layer skin model was applied concerning the above skin permeation profiles of the five drugs. Diffusion parameter (D'), partition parameter (K'), and permeation constant (Kp = D' x K') were calculated using the Laplace-transformed equations with the aid of MULTI (FILT). It was well demonstrated that the reduction of lag time and the increase of flux caused by EtOH/Panasate 800 binary vehicle systems was due to an increase of D' value by Panasate 800 and K' value by EtOH, respectively, in the skin. Especially, the EtOH/Panasate 800 (40/60) binary vehicle system produced the largest Kp value in each drug.

Five-month-old YMP skin showed small variation with respect to drug permeation rates, if the region of skin site was the same. But skin from 6-month-old YMPs showed faster and varied permeation rates due to skin defects. In the case of hydrophilic drugs, no effects on permeation due to the region from which the skin was obtained were observed, although higher permeation rates were observed through the flank than through dorsal skin in the case of ibuprofen and ketoprofen. For YMP skin, the permeation coefficients of drugs were lower than those for hairless rat skin, especially for hydrophilic drugs. Compared with reported human data on permeation coefficients, the permeation coefficients of drugs through YMP skin were 1/2-1/8 of those through human skin, regardless of whether the drugs were hydrophilic or lipophilic.

High encapsulation efficiency and release control of drugs are essential for clinical application of liposomes. For efficient drug loading into liposomes, remote loading method using driving force like transmembrane gradients of pH and ions are utilized. Ions are called as ""trapping agents,"" which are also critical for the controlled release of drugs loaded into liposomes inside. It is difficult to apply ions as trapping agents to various drugs because of limited physicochemical compatibility between drugs and ions. Cyclodextrins (CDs) with hydrophobic cavity can make inclusion complexes with various hydrophobic compounds. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the potential of CDs as a novel trapping agent using sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) and ibuprofen (IB), a weak acid hydrophobic drug. Encapsulation efficiency of IB in liposomes with pH gradient was approximately 27%, and it was enhanced by intraliposomal SBE-β-CD inclusion in addition to pH gradient, which was SBE-β-CD concentration-dependent. In liposomes with pH gradient, a large fraction of IB was released in a short time. This early-stage rapid IB release was significantly suppressed by the inclusion of SBE-β-CD inside liposomes. Thus, novel remote loading technology by intraliposomal SBE-β-CD enabled the efficient encapsulation of the hydrophobic drug into the aqueous phase of liposomes as well as their controlled release. This technology should be applied to various drugs that can be included into CDs in order to enhance their therapeutic benefits.",2024,,"Akaki S, Hosokawa M, Maeda S, Kono Y, Maeda H, Ogawara KI.",https://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.b24-00558,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics on ibuprofen formulation', 'Measurable endpoints related to ibuprofen release', 'Comparison with traditional methods']","The study presents controlled release and encapsulation efficiency of ibuprofen via liposomes, relevant for diffusion research.

Three kinds of drugs, indomethacin, ibuprofen and sulfanilamide which have similar solubilities in a mixed organic solvent (ethanol-diethylcarbitol, 40:60 v/v), were selected to evaluate the drug penetration with or without 5% AZ. Transdermal delivery rates were determined at 27 and 37 degrees C by using an in vitro diffusion cell procedure and the abdominal full-thickness skin of hairless rat. The solubility of each of the three drugs in the solvent with AZ was similar to that without AZ. Ethanol in the vehicle penetrated through the skin prior to the drugs. Activation energies for the skin penetration of the three drugs in the presence of AZ were decreased compared to those in its absence. For all drugs the partition coefficients between the skin and vehicle with AZ were 2-80 times higher than those without it. The activity coefficients of drugs in the presence of AZ in the skin were 2-90 times lower than those without the enhancer.

Liquid paraffin (LP) was used as the oil, and indomethacin (IM), ketoprofen (KP), flurbiprofen (FP) and ibuprofen (IP) were used as model drugs. IM did not dissolve in LP, but solubilized when heated with HSL at a concentration of about 1% with 15% HSL at 95 degrees C. IM gel was thus prepared as follows: IM and HSL were mixed, added into LP, capped tightly, heated in a water bath and cooled. The consistency of the gel increased with increasing IM concentration, indicating some kind of interaction between IM and HSL. The release of IM from the IM gel was faster than that from a preparation in which IM was mixed in gel at room temperature (Gel + IM). The release rate of IM from IM gel was proportional to IM concentrations up to 1%, but became constant above that. Permeation of IM through hairless rat abdominal skin from IM gel was higher than that from the Gel + IM. The permeation rate was proportional to IM concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 0.5% in 15% HSL gel. KP and FP also solubilized in gel when subjected to the same procedure as IM, and their release and permeation increased when they were formulated as gels. However, no evident improvement of permeation was observed in the case of IP, which had high LP solubility. It was suggested that HSL showed no enhancing effect, but solubilized IM, KP or FP, leading to high permeation from the gel. After 3 months' storage, the permeation rate did not change for 0.5% IM in 15% HSL gel, but decreased for 1% IM in 15% HSL gel. This indicates that in the case of 1% IM in 15% HSL gel, IM is in a supersaturated state immediately after preparation and then recrystallizes with time.",1994,,"Henmi T, Fujii M, Kikuchi K, Yamanobe N, Matsumoto M.",https://doi.org/10.1248/cpb.42.651,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen release and permeation rates', 'Comparison of formulations', 'Statistical methods used for measurements', 'Long-term stability data']","The study directly investigates the permeation of ibuprofen through skin using an oily gel formulation, which is relevant for ongoing research in drug delivery systems.",0.9

We determined the permeation of both compounds from the IL through a silicone membrane selected as a model biological membrane, and mathematically analyzed the permeation data from the viewpoint of the thermodynamic activities of lidocaine, ibuprofen, and the IL. As a result, IL and ibuprofen diffusely permeated through the membrane in the case of applying IL preparations with a molar fraction of ibuprofen of 0.5 or higher. The IL was thought to separate into lidocaine and ibuprofen in the receiver. On the other hand, when applying IL preparations with a molar fraction of lidocaine of 0.5 or higher, IL and lidocaine permeated. The permeation rate of IL itself was maximized when the applied IL was prepared using equimolar amounts of lidocaine and ibuprofen, and it decreased when the fraction of lidocaine or ibuprofen increased by more than 0.5.

The MSM prepared at 500°C (MSM-500) had the highest surface area, pore size, and volume, and the results of isotherms and the kinetics of ibuprofen (IBP) removal indicated that MSM-500 had the highest sorption capacity and fastest removal speed vs. SBA-15 and zeolite. Compared with commercial granular activated carbon (GAC), MSM-500 had a ~100 times higher sorption rate at neutral pH. IBP uptake by MSM-500 was thermodynamically favorable at room temperature, which was interpreted as indicating relatively weak bonding because the entropy (∆adsS, -0.07 J mol(-1) K(-1)) was much smaller. Five times recycling tests revealed that MSM-500 had 83-87% recovery efficiencies and slower uptake speeds due to slight deformation of the outer pore structure. In the IBP delivery test, MSM-500 drug loading was 41%, higher than the reported value of SBA-15 (31%). The in vitro release of IBP was faster, almost 100%, reaching equilibrium within a few hours, indicating its effective loading and unloading characteristics.

In melanoma, despite recent advances in targeted therapy and immunomodulatory therapies, this cancer remains difficult to treat. Our previous studies show melanoma cells interact with skin cells in their invasion into tissue engineered skin and suggest inflammation stimulates invasion. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. To do this we developed a wounded and inflamed in vitro 3D melanoma model in which to investigate the use of an anti-inflammatory on melanoma invasion. The tissue engineered skin model was based on human de-epidermised acellular dermis to which keratinocytes, fibroblasts and three different melanoma cell lines were added in various combinations. A simple incisional wound was made in the model and TNF-α and fibrin were added to simulate conditions of inflammation. Topical ibuprofen in a hydrogel was added and the extent of melanoma invasion into the dermis was assessed under the various conditions. The results showed that penetration of two of the cell lines (HBL and A375SM) into the tissue engineered skin was exacerbated by wounding and ibuprofen significantly decreased invasion of A375SM cells and slightly reduced invasion of HBL cells. A third cell line, C8161, was aggressively invasive under all conditions to an extent that was not influenced by wounding, TNF-α or the addition of ibuprofen. In summary, the results for one these cell lines (and a trend for a second cell line) support the hypothesis that a wound environment is conducive to melanoma invasion but the local addition of an anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen may attenuate invasion.",2016,,"Marques CM, MacNeil S.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156931&type=printable,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on ibuprofen formulation and concentration', 'Methods for measuring melanoma invasion', 'Specific results on permeation through the skin model', 'Comparison of cell line responses', 'In vitro conditions description']","The study focuses on ibuprofen's effects within a tissue engineered skin model, highlighting significant interactions with melanoma cells and skin barriers, which aligns with permeation research.",0.9

The method outlined in this article draws together a number of scientific techniques and makes use of generally unwanted biological tissues as a means of determining skin inflammation <i>ex vivo</i>, and focuses on probing aspects of the arachidonic acid inflammation pathway. Freshly excised skin contains elevated levels of short-lived inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and, under viable conditions, COX-2 and its eicosanoid products will continue to be produced until tissue necrosis, providing a window of time in which relative levels can be probed to determine exacerbation due to an upregulating factor or downregulation due the presence of an agent exerting anti-inflammatory activity. <i>Ex vivo</i> porcine skin, mounted in Franz diffusion cells, is dosed topically with the xenobiotic challenge and then techniques such as Western blotting and immunohistochemistry can then be used to probe relative COX-2 levels on a semi-quantitative or qualitative level. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or LCMS can be used to determine relative prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) levels. Thus far, the technique has been used to examine the effects of topically applied anti-inflammatories (betamethasone, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and methotrexate), natural products (fish oil, Devil's claw extract and pomegranate rind extract) and drug delivery vehicle (polyNIPAM nanogels). Topically applied xenobiotics that modulate factors such as COX-2 and PGE-2 must penetrate the intact skin, and this provides direct evidence of overcoming the ""barrier function"" of the stratum corneum in order to target the viable epidermis in sufficient levels to be able to elicit such effects.

With the melting temperature-membrane transport model, the flux ratio of enantiomer/racemate was calculated from their thermodynamic properties obtained by differential scanning calorimetry.

New fluorescent probes were designed and utilized in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) study for visualization of the enantioselective permeation of the enantiomers through the intact rabbit skin.<h4>Result</h4>The flux of (S)-ibuprofen through normal skin was significantly higher than that of (RS)-ibuprofen and (R)-ibuprofen (p < 0.05), whereas in damaged skin, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). The predicted flux ratio of (S)-ibuprofen/(RS)-ibuprofen (2.50) was in close agreement with the experimentally determined ratio (2.48). These results were supported by ATR-FTIR and CLSM studies that indicated that a chiral environment of the skin led to the enantioselective permeation of enantiomers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The chiral nature of the SC and the different physicochemical properties of the enantiomers should be taken into account in the assessment of different skin permeability of the racemate and enantiomers.

MED,21903019,21903019.0,10.18433/j3160b,A new vesicle-loaded hydrogel system suitable for topical applications: preparation and characterization.,"PURPOSE. Aim of this research was to prepare and study drug release from a new formulation consisting of non ionic surfactant vesicular structures, niosomes (NSVs), loaded with model molecules calcein (CALC), nile red (NR), ibuprofen (IBU) or caffeine (CAFF), and embedded in a hydrogel matrix. METHODS. The system locust bean gum/xanthan (1:1), prepared at 60 °C, was used to entrap the vesicles (Tween 20/cholesterol 1:1), loaded with guest molecules and the release profiles were detected at 32 °C. The hydrogel systems were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy; niosomes were characterized by means of size and -potential measurements. RESULTS. Size measurements showed that a slight increase in vesicle dimensions occurs after inclusion of CALC or CAFF (hydrophilic molecules) in the vesicular structures. -potential measurements showed that the inclusion of these molecules did not significantly modify the surface charge of empty vesicles. This was probably related to an almost negligible drug adsorption on the vesicle surface. The release from the niosomes-gel systems of two probes (CALC and NR) showed that the diffusion of CALC through the gel was not affected by the niosome entrapment while for NR, the presence of vesicles was crucial. The release profiles from niosomes-gel systems and from the hydrogel alone of model drugs, CAFF and IBU, showed an appreciable difference between the two drugs: the more hydrophilic CAFF was released much faster than IBU. In all release studies turbidity, dimension and -potential analyses indicated that the loaded niosomes were released by the hydrogel matrix without being damaged. CONCLUSIONS. The reported in vitro experiments show the capability of the novel formulation to combine the qualities of both chosen single systems, i.e. the niosomes and the polymeric network. The hydrogel shows a protective effect on vesicle integrity and leads to a slow release of the loaded model molecules from the polysaccharidic system. This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

Firstly, cinnamon oil was extracted by steam distillation, then the compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the cinnamaldehyde content in cinnamon oil was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). With azone as positive control, ibuprofen as model drug, cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde as penetration enhancers (PE) were prepared and administered to the SD rat's abdominal skin. The penetration-enhancing effects of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde and their own transdermal absorption properties were compared. The results showed that yield of cinnamon oil was (3.55±0.36)% (<i>n</i>=3), and the cinnamaldehyde content in cinnamon oil was (73.48±0.21)% (<i>n</i>=3). As compared with blank group, the enhancing rate (ER) of cinnamon oil, cinnamaldehyde, and azone was 3.56, 1.13, 2.47 respectively.

Under the presence of 3 kinds of the primary bile salts such a sodium taurocholate, etc., or a secondary bile salt such a sodium taurochenodeoxycholate at 0.01 mmol/L concentration, a significant difference was not demonstrated in the permeation clearance of the ibuprofen entrapped O/W microemulsion, as compared with the case without the bile salts. Thus, the bile salts did not have a remarkable influence on the permeability of the drug entrapped in the O/W microemulsion, and it was verified that this O/W microemulsion was hardly influenced by the flow of the bile secretion. On the other hand, when N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) with the removal ability of a mucin layer was combined with the ibuprofen entrapped O/W microemulsion at the concentration of 3 and 10 mmol/L, it was shown that the permeation clearance of free ibuprofen did not decrease, but that of ibuprofen entrapped in the O/W microemulsion decreased with the increase of the NAC concentration. Therefore, it is confirmed that the mucin layer participates in the permeability of the drug entrapped in the O/W microemulsion.

However, due to the low selectivity of cancer cells, chemotherapy drugs produce a series of grievous side effects on normal cells.<h4>Methods</h4>In this research, we developed novel nanocarriers for magnetically targeted near-infrared (NIR) light-electromagnetic wave dual controlled drug delivery based on MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS nanoparticles (NPs) modified with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in response to magnetic, NIR light, and electromagnetic wave irradiation. Synthesis and characterization of MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS-APTES NPs was carried out using X-ray diffraction measurements, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence emission spectra, UV-1800 spectrophotometer, N5230A vector network analyzer, MDS-6 microwave sample preparation system, and superconducting quantum interference device. In addition to that mentioned above, we also explored many other sides, such as the drug-loading, drug-controlled release efficiency, elect99omagnetic wave thermal effect and photo-thermal effect.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that APTES-modified MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS NPs had 37% high drug-loading capacity and high electromagnetic wave thermal conversion ability and NIR-light thermal conversion ability. In addition, ibuprofen (IBU) release from the MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS-APTES-IBU depends on the electromagnetic wave (2.45 GHz) and 1060 nm NIR light irradiation. After five cycles, the drug-release percentage was 90% and 66% separately, and could be adjusted by the time and cycles times of electromagnetic wave and NIR light irritation. Electromagnetic wave irradiation compared with NIR light irradiation, has a higher drug release rate and better penetration. Therefore, choosing different stimulation methods according to the treatment needs of the disease, we can achieve accurate personalized treatment of the disease.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our findings indicate that multifunctional APTES modified MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@CuS NPs could be used for the first time as a new drug carrier for ""location-timing-quantification"" drug release with magnetic targeting and dual control of NIR light-electromagnetic waves.",2020,,"Peng H, Wang M, Hu C, Guo J.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S267614,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,both,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology on drug release measurements', 'Specifics of the diffusion cell setup used', 'Comparative results for different barriers tested', 'Formulation details of the MgFe2O4@CuS-APTES-IBU']","The study discusses ibuprofen release using a novel nanocarrier and evaluates its drug release under specific irradiation conditions, making it highly relevant for permeation analysis.",0.9
MED,22973096,22973096.0,10.2147/ijn.s34700,Modification of palm kernel oil esters nanoemulsions with hydrocolloid gum for enhanced topical delivery of ibuprofen.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>During recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of nanoemulsion as a drug-carrier system for topical delivery. A nanoemulsion is a transparent mixture of oil, surfactant and water with a very low viscosity, usually the product of its high water content. The present study investigated the modification of nanoemulsions with different hydrocolloid gums, to enhanced drug delivery of ibuprofen. The in vitro characterization of the initial and modified nanoemulsions was also studied.<h4>Methods</h4>A palm kernel oil esters nanoemulsion was modified with different hydrocolloid gums for the topical delivery of ibuprofen. Three different hydrocolloids (gellan gum, xanthan gum, and carrageenan) were selected for use. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed using palm kernel oil esters as the oil, Tween 80 as the surfactant, and water. Nanoemulsions were prepared by phase inversion composition, and were gradually mixed with the freshly prepared hydrocolloids. The initial nanoemulsion and modified nanoemulsions were characterized. The abilities of the nanoemulsions to deliver ibuprofen were assessed in vitro, using a Franz diffusion cell fitted with rat skin.<h4>Results</h4>No significant changes were observed in droplet size (~16-20 nm) but a significant difference in polydispersity indexes were observed before and after the modification of nanoemulsions using gellan gum, carrageenan, and xanthan gum. The zeta potentials of the initial nanoemulsions (-11.0 mV) increased to -19.6 mV, -13.9 mV, and -41.9 mV, respectively. The abilities of both the initial nanoemulsion (T802) and the modified nanoemulsion to deliver ibuprofen through the skin were evaluated in vitro, using Franz diffusion cells fitted with rat skin. The in vitro permeation data showed that the modified nanoemulsion (Kp value of 55.4 × 10(-3) cm · h(-1)) increased the permeability of ibuprofen 4.40 times over T802 (Kp value of 12.6 × 10(-3) cm · h(-1)) (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The modified nanoemulsion may be a promising vehicle to enhance the permeation of ibuprofen for topical delivery.",2012,,"Salim N, Basri M, Rahman MB, Abdullah DK, Basri H.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S34700,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Detailed methodology of nanoemulsion preparation', 'In vitro permeation data breakdown', 'Characterization results of different hydrocolloid gums', 'Statistical analysis of permeability results']","The study involves in vitro permeation of ibuprofen using a Franz diffusion cell, with measurable endpoints related to drug delivery efficiency.

Recurrent wound infections and prolonged treatment impose significant economic and psychological burdens, drastically reducing patients' quality of life. Modulating the inflammatory response is a promising strategy to accelerate diabetic wound healing. Ibuprofen (IBU), a widely used anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent, has the potential to promote healing by mitigating excessive inflammation and alleviating wound-associated pain. However, its clinical application is hindered by poor water solubility and a short half-life. Therefore, a controlled and sustained-release system for IBU could enhance its therapeutic efficacy in diabetic wound management.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Here, we present an in situ multi-crosslinked composite hydrogel system that integrates oxidized alginate (OSA), methacryloylated gelatin (GelMA), and an ibuprofen/amino-modified β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (IBU/CD-NH<sub>2</sub>) via ion crosslinking, photocrosslinking, and Schiff-base reactions.<h4>Results</h4>The optimized hydrogel formulation was synthesized at 35°C, with a P/A molar ratio of 2 and an methacrylamide(MA) volume fraction of 20%. Physicochemical and biocompatibility analyses demonstrated that the IBU-loaded composite hydrogel exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, favorable biocompatibility, tunable degradation, and injectability. This system effectively addresses IBU's solubility and absorption challenges while conforming to wounds of varying shapes and sizes, enabling controlled and sustained drug release. Cellular and animal studies confirmed that the hydrogel continuously and uniformly releases IBU, exerting anti-inflammatory effects while promoting angiogenesis and fibroblast migration. This leads to enhanced granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and epidermal regeneration, significantly accelerating wound closure within 14 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By simultaneously suppressing inflammation and stimulating tissue regeneration through controlled IBU release, this hydrogel system offers a highly effective strategy for diabetic wound healing and holds strong potential for clinical application.",2025,,"Li Z, Dong H, Yang S, Wang X, Li Z.",https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S504924,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Specifics on the in vitro diffusion study setup', 'Details on the Franz diffusion cell methodology', 'Quantitative data on ibuprofen release rates', 'Comparative analysis of drug release profiles', 'Characterization of hydrogel properties and their impact on permeation']","The abstract indicates the development of a controlled-release ibuprofen formulation and mentions its release characteristics, which aligns with in vitro permeation studies.

MED,33177865,33177865.0,10.2147/jpr.s262390,Comparison of Skin Permeation and Putative Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Commercially Available Topical Products Containing Ibuprofen and Diclofenac.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The therapeutic effect of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) depends on the drug's ability to penetrate and permeate the skin and subsequently inhibit cyclo-oxygenase (COX) isoforms responsible for pain and inflammation. Most commercially available topical NSAID formulations are clinically effective, but direct comparisons of anti-inflammatory activity including both skin absorption and inhibitory potency are lacking. This study examined the skin absorption of representative commercially available topical diclofenac- and ibuprofen-based formulations along with published potency values to determine formulations with superior anti-inflammatory activity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Cumulative absorption and flux profiles of 12 commercially available topical NSAIDs (6 diclofenac-based and 6 ibuprofen-based) were evaluated in vitro using human skin in static Franz diffusion cells. Each formulation was applied as a single dose. In vitro permeation parameters and published COX-2 inhibition values were used to calculate a modified index of topical anti-inflammatory activity (mITAA).<h4>Results</h4>All diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations permeated human skin in vitro. The rate and degree of absorption differed between diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations and between formulations of the same drug. NSAID concentration within a product was not solely responsible for the permeation flux or degree of absorption. Ibuprofen formulations permeated the skin more rapidly and to a greater degree than diclofenac, but calculated mITAAs were higher for diclofenac.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Diclofenac exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity as measured by the index. Differences beyond drug concentration, including excipients, drug salt form, and dosage form, contribute to differences in absorption and thus in anti-inflammatory activity. Both absorption and COX-2 inhibition potency are important for anti-inflammatory activity, but their priority depends upon the products being compared-with the same NSAID, absorption determines superiority; with different NSAIDs, superiority is determined by the balance between absorption and COX-2 potency. These findings should be considered when selecting a topical NSAID for treating patient pain and inflammation.",2020,,Pradal J.,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=63364,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on formulations used', 'Specific in vitro measurement techniques', 'Data on permeation rates and flux', 'COX-2 inhibition results', 'Comparison of results between formulations']",The study directly involves in vitro permeation using Franz diffusion cells to evaluate ibuprofen formulations.

In case of poorly soluble drugs, due to thermodynamic challenges, there is a high tendency for the drug to nucleate immediately after formulating or even during storage. The present study focuses on the efficiency of vitamin E TPGS/HPMC supersaturated solution and other solubilizer/polymer systems to improve the solubility of the drug and inhibit crystal growth in the transdermal formulation. Effect of several solubilizers, for example, Pluronic F-127, vitamin E TPGS and co-solvent, for example, propylene glycol (PG) were studied on the supersaturated systems of ibuprofen as model drug. Various stabilizers such as hydroxylpropyl methylcellulose (HPMC 3 cps) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K-30) were examined to evaluate their crystal inhibitory effects. Different analytical tools were used in this study to detect the growth of crystals in the systems.

The toxicity of borneol was evaluated in epidermal keratinocyte HaCaT and dermal fibroblast CCC-HSF-1 cell cultures and compared to known enhancers, and its irritant profile was also assessed by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) evaluation. The promoting effect of borneol on the transdermal permeation of five model drugs, namely 5-fluorouracil, antipyrine, aspirin, salicylic acid and ibuprofen, which were selected based on their lipophilicity denoted by logp value, were performed using in vitro skin permeation studies. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was employed to monitor the borneol-induced alteration in molecular organization of SC lipids. The enhancer borneol displayed lower cytotoxicity or irritation in comparison to the well-established and standard enhancer Azone.

Additionally, many attempts have been made to tune hydrophobic/hydrophilic drug release kinetics over time, avoiding the so-called <i>burst release</i>. In this scenario, hydrogels resulting from the assembly of micellar structures showing a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell could represent a promising alternative to design versatile drug vehicles. In this regard, this work aimed at designing new thermosensitive micellar hydrogels starting from a custom-made amphiphilic poly(ether urethane) (PEU). Specifically, a commercial triblock copolymer (Poloxamer<sup>®</sup> 407), selected to ensure the temperature-driven chain arrangement into micelles, was reacted with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. The successful PEU synthesis was proved by size-exclusion chromatography ( M ¯ <sub><i>w</i></sub> 50000 Da) and infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, the wettability-driven drug arrangement within the micelle network as well as the influence of drug-loading on the resultant formulation thermosensitivity was investigated by selecting ibuprofen (IBU) and ibuprofen sodium salt (IBUSS) as hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, respectively. Specifically, growing drug amounts were loaded into PEU solutions, and the average hydrodynamic micelle diameters and the critical micellar temperatures (CMT) were measured. Systems containing IBU at the highest tested concentration (i.e., 20 mg/mL) showed a significantly higher micelle average diameter (58.2 ± 4.7 nm) and a remarkably lower CMT (8.9°C) with respect to both the control (40.1 ± 1.4 nm and 21.6°C) and IBUSS-loaded formulations (37.3 ± 2.1 nm and 22.4°C). Then, the influence of drug encapsulation on the temperature at which micelles begin to aggregate was rheologically assessed, showing that IBU-loading induced a decrease in this parameter (14.6, 8.7, and 13.7°C for virgin, IBU-loaded, and IBUSS-loaded hydrogel, respectively). Finally, IBU and IBUSS releasing mechanism was analysed using the Korsmayer-Peppas model (<i>n</i> value of 0.63 ± 0.007 and 0.89 ± 0.003 for IBU- and IBUSS-loaded gels, respectively). Thanks to their micellar organisation, the here-developed hydrogel platform allowed the encapsulation of a high number of molecules with different wettability.

Hearing loss can be the result of intense or prolonged noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, infections, and trauma, which trigger inflammatory signaling cascades that lead to irreversible damage to cochlear structures. To address this, we developed and characterized a series of covalent conjugates of anti-inflammatory drugs to hyaluronic acid (HA), for potential use as topical ototherapeutics. These conjugates were tested in <i>in vitro</i> assays designed to mirror physiological processes typically observed with acoustic trauma. Intense noise exposure leads to macrophage recruitment to the cochlea and subsequent inflammatory damage to sensory cells. We therefore first tested our conjugates' ability to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. This anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages also translated to increased cochlear cell viability. In our initial screening, one conjugate, ibuprofen-HA, demonstrated significantly higher anti-inflammatory potential than its counterparts. Subsequent cytokine release profiling of ibuprofen-HA further confirmed its ability to reduce a wider range of inflammatory markers, to a greater extent than its equivalent unconjugated drug. The conjugate's potential as a topical therapeutic was then assessed in previously developed tympanic and round window membrane tissue permeation models. As expected, our data indicate that the conjugate has limited tympanic membrane model permeability; however, it readily permeated the round window membrane model and to a greater extent than the unconjugated drug. Interestingly, our data also revealed that ibuprofen-HA was well tolerated in cellular and tissue cytocompatibility assays, whereas the unconjugated drug displayed significant cytotoxicity at equivalent concentrations. Moreover, our data highlighted the importance of chemical conjugation of ibuprofen to HA; the conjugate had improved anti-inflammatory effects, significantly reduced cytotoxicity, and is more suitable for therapeutic formulation. Overall, this work suggests that ibuprofen-HA could be a promising safe and effective topical ototherapeutic for inflammation-mediated cochlear damage.",2024,,"Birru B, Veit JGS, Arrigali EM, Van Tine J, Barrett-Catton E, Tonnerre Z, Diaz P, Serban MA.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1355283/pdf,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVPT,yes,yes,both,"['specific permeability data for ibuprofen-HA', 'comparison with unconjugated ibuprofen', 'mechanism of action of HA conjugation', 'details on the in vitro models used']",The study develops a novel ibuprofen conjugate and tests its effectiveness in permeability models; relevant for IVPT data.,0.9

The approach presented here is centered around the development of a prototypic synthetic glycerogel scaffold for bone regeneration, which simultaneously features therapeutic activity. The main novelty of this work lies in the combination of an open meso and macroporous nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC)-based glycerogel with a fully biocompatible microporous bioMOF system (CaSyr-1) composed of calcium ions and syringic acid. The bioMOF framework is further impregnated with a third bioactive component, i.e., ibuprofen (ibu), to generate a multifold bioactive system. The integrated CaSyr-1(ibu) serves as a reservoir for bioactive compounds delivery, while the NCC scaffold is the proposed matrix for cell ingrowth, proliferation and differentiation. The measured drug delivery profiles, studied in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 310 K, indicate that the bioactive components are released concurrently with bioMOF dissolution after ca. 30 min following a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Furthermore, according to the semi-empirical Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model, this release is governed by a case-II mechanism, suggesting that the molecular transport is influenced by the relaxation of the NCC matrix. Preliminary in vitro results denote that the initial high concentration of glycerol in the NCC scaffold can be toxic in direct contact with human osteoblasts (HObs).

The release and permeation of the microemulsion formulations were performed in vitro by Franz cell studies on a regenerated cellulose membrane and a Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane, respectively, and the amount of ibuprofen permeated and released was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All four microemulsions were compatible with the skin pH, and the average pH ranged from 4.9 to 5.6. The average droplet size of the microemulsions ranged from 119.8 to 153.3 nm. Drug release was significantly the highest from the gel-based microemulsions (59% and 64%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). However, there was a fourfold difference in drug permeation from these gels-a significantly higher permeation from the microemulsion-gel containing oleic acid and oleyl alcohol compared to the DGME formulation. These results indicated that the microemulsion-gel with oleyl alcohol as the permeation enhancer could be a preferable formulation approach for the topical administration of ibuprofen. These results highlight the need for optimization of the microemulsion formulation to confirm the permeation-enhancing effects of chosen permeation enhancers despite being a well-known permeation enhancer.",2025,,"Pandey S, Baki G.",https://doi.org/10.3390/gels11010041,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,IVPT,yes,yes,both,"['Details on ibuprofen concentration used', 'Specific methodologies for formulation preparation', 'Comparative results for permeation with different enhancers', 'Data on skin compatibility tests', 'Analysis methods for measuring permeation']","The study directly investigates ibuprofen permeation using Franz cell studies, indicating relevance to the dataset.

Due to their variable physical-chemical properties, polysaccharides have potentialities to be used for designing new drug delivery systems for controlled drug release. In this comparative study, rheological and texture properties as well as the in vitro release of model drug ibuprofen (IBU) with 11 polysaccharide-based hydrogels were investigated. The in vitro release of IBU significantly differed between (i) neutral (hydroxy/alkylcelluloses), (ii) anionic (carboxyalkylcellulose and its sodium salt, tragacanth, carrageenan, xanthan gum), and (iii) cationic (chitosans) hydrogels due to different contribution of provided interactions and viscosity within the hydrogel groups. The drug release kinetics of each hydrogel system was evaluated for five kinetic models. Several combinations of cationic hydrogels with neutral or anionic ones were performed to illustrate possibilities of providing modified IBU release profiles. In this context, chitosan was presented as an effective modifier of diffusion profiles for negatively charged drugs formulated into combined polymeric systems, providing their prolonged release.

Due to a short half-life and rapid elimination, multiple doses of ibuprofen are required in a day to maintain pharmacological action for a long duration of time. Due to multiple intakes of ibuprofen, certain severe adverse effects, such as gastric irritation, bleeding, ulcers, and abdominal pain are produced. Therefore, a system is needed which not only prolongs the release of ibuprofen but also overcomes the drug's adverse effects. Hence, the authors have synthesized chondroitin sulfate/sodium polystyrene sulfonate-co-poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels by the free radical polymerization technique for the controlled release of ibuprofen. Sol-gel, porosity, swelling, and drug release studies were performed on the fabricated hydrogel. The pH-responsive behavior of the fabricated hydrogel was determined by both swelling and drug release studies in three different pH values, i.e., pH 1.2, 4.6, and 7.4. Maximum swelling and drug release were observed at pH 7.4, as compared to pH 4.6 and 1.2. Similarly, the structural arrangement and crosslinking of the hydrogel contents were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluated the hard and irregular surface with a few macrospores of the developed hydrogel, which may be correlated with the strong crosslinking of polymers with monomer content. Similarly, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated the high thermal stability of the formulated hydrogel, as compared to pure polymers. A decrease in the crystallinity of chondroitin sulfate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate after crosslinking was revealed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Thus, considering the results, we can demonstrate that a developed polymeric network of hydrogel could be used as a safe, stable, and efficient carrier for the controlled release of ibuprofen.",2022,,"Suhail M, Chiu IH, Hung MC, Vu QL, Lin IL, Wu PC.",https://doi.org/10.3390/gels8070406,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",later,no,uncertain,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Details on diffusion cell setup', 'Specifics of ibuprofen release measurements', 'Formulation details of hydrogel', 'Comparison of results with Franz cell data']","The study involves the release of ibuprofen from hydrogels, but it is uncertain if the methodology specifically uses Franz diffusion cells.

As a result, semi-solid formulations in the form of an emulsion-based gel loaded with ibuprofen and its derivatives, such as sodium ibuprofenate (IBUNa) and L-phenylalanine ethyl ester ibuprofenate ([PheOEt][IBU]), were developed. The properties of the obtained formulations were examined, including density, refractive index, viscosity, and particle size distribution. The parameters of release and permeability through the pig skin of the active substances contained in the obtained semi-solid formulations were determined. The results indicate that an emulsion-based gel enhanced the skin penetration of IBU and its derivatives compared to two commercial preparations in the form of a gel and a cream.

The composites consisted of biomimetic hydroxyapatite (mHA) enriched with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, type I collagen, alginate, and, additionally, chitosan and sericin. The granules were loaded with ibuprofen sodium salt. The investigation encompassed a morphology characterization, a porosity analysis, a chemical structure assessment, and an examination of the swelling behavior, drug release kinetics (ibuprofen), and release profiles of zinc and magnesium ions. The granules exhibited irregular surfaces with an enhanced homogeneity in the chitosan-coated granules and well-developed mesoporous structures. The FT-IR spectra confirmed the presence of ibuprofen sodium, despite overlapping bands for the polymers. The granules demonstrated a high water-absorption capacity, with delayed swelling observed in the chitosan-coated granules. Ibuprofen displayed burst-release profiles, especially in the G1 and G3 samples. In the case of the chitosan-coated granules (G2 and G4), lower amounts of ibuprofen were released. In turn, there was a significant difference in the released amount of magnesium and zinc ions from the granules, which was most likely caused by their different location in the hydroxyapatite crystals. The cytotoxicity assays confirmed the non-cytotoxic behavior of the biomaterial. These findings suggest the potential applicability of these biomaterials in dental scenarios, emphasizing their multifunctional and biocompatible nature.",2023,,"Kołodziejska B, Figat R, Kolmas J.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/16751/pdf?version=1700902868,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed drug release kinetics for ibuprofen', 'Formulation specifics of the biomaterials', 'Swelling behavior analysis results']","The study specifically investigates ibuprofen release from composite granules, indicating measurable drug release endpoints and formulation information related to ibuprofen in a relevant context.",0.9

The percutaneous permeation across the human skin and transdermal diffusion test model (Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membranes) of ibuprofen and its structural modification were measured and compared using Franz diffusion cells. For comparison, the penetration of ibuprofen from a commercial product was also investigated.

The membranes were characterized for various physical and chemical properties using techniques such as FTIR, SEM, AFM, TEM, EDS, and contact angle measurements. The membranes were then evaluated for their efficiency in rejecting EOCs and resistance to protein fouling. TEM micrographs showed uniform distribution of Ag/Pd nanoparticles within the PES matrix, while SEM images showed uniform, fingerlike structures that were not affected by the presence of embedded nanoparticles. The presence of Ag/Pd nanoparticles resulted in rougher membranes. There was an increase in membrane hydrophilicity with increasing nanoparticles loading, which resulted in improved pure water permeability (37−135 Lm2h−1bar−1). The membranes exhibited poor salt rejection (<15%), making them less susceptible to flux decline due to concentration polarization. With a mean pore radius of 2.39−4.70 nm, the membranes effectively removed carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, and naproxen (up to 40%), with size exclusion being the major removal mechanism.

From the UHPLC-MS/MS analysis, we identified 60 components of the polyphenolic complex such as quercetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucuronide, quercetin acetyl-glycoside, isorhamnetin acetyl-glycoside, isorhamnetin caffeoyl-glycoside, quercetin caffeoyl-malonyl-glycoside, isorhamnetin coumaroyl-glycoside, coumaroyl-caffeoylquinic acid, and diCQA-acetyl-derivative were first reported in the composition of <i>H. italicum</i>. The biological activity of the fractions was evaluated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i>, which included the fight against oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity (HPSA), hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (HRSA), metal-chelating activity (MChA)) and nitrosative (nitric oxide scavenging activity) (NOSA)), <i>in vitro</i> anti-inflammatory, and anti-arthritic activity. Results are presented as IC<sub>50</sub> ± SD μg/mL.

New derivatives of (<i>RS</i>)-2-[4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl]propionic acid were synthesized using hydrochlorides of alkyl esters (ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, <i>sec</i>-butyl, <i>tert</i>-butyl, and pentyl) of L-glutamine. These were further transformed into alkyl esters of L-amino acid ibuprofenates through neutralization and protonation reactions. Characterization involved spectroscopic methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Various physicochemical properties were investigated, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, polarimetric analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, water solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient, and permeability through pig skin using Franz diffusion cells. The research confirmed the ionic structure of the obtained hydrochlorides of alkyl esters of L-amino acids and ibuprofenates of alkyl esters of L-glutamic acid. It revealed significant correlations between ester chain length and thermal stability, crystallinity, phase transition temperatures, lipophilicity, water solubility, skin permeability, and skin accumulation of these compounds. Compared to the parent ibuprofen, the synthesized derivatives exhibited higher water solubility, lower lipophilicity, and enhanced skin permeability.

OMCs' efficiency could be further increased by embedding them into a hydrogel phase for an <i>in loco</i> prolonged drug release. In this work, OMCs were embedded into injectable thermosensitive hydrogels. In detail, rod-like (diameter ca. 250 nm, length ca. 700 nm) and spherical (diameter approximately 120 nm) OMCs were synthesized by nanocasting selected templates and loaded with ibuprofen through a melt infiltration method to achieve complete filling of their pores (100% loading yield). In parallel, an amphiphilic Poloxamer® 407-based poly(ether urethane) was synthesized (Mn¯ 72 kDa) and solubilized at 15 and 20% <i>w/v</i> concentration in saline solution to design thermosensitive hydrogels. OMC incorporation into the hydrogels (10 mg/mL concentration) did not negatively affect their gelation potential. Hybrid systems successfully released ibuprofen at a slower rate compared to control gels (gels embedding ibuprofen as such), but with no significant differences between rod-like and spherical OMC-loaded gels. OMCs can thus work as effective drug reservoirs that progressively release their payload over time and also upon encapsulation in a hydrogel phase, thus opening the way to their application to treat many different pathological states (e.g., as topical medications).",2020,,"Boffito M, Laurano R, Giasafaki D, Steriotis T, Papadopoulos A, Tonda-Turo C, Cassino C, Charalambopoulou G, Ciardelli G.",https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10112165,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Detailed methodology of ibuprofen loading', 'Release kinetics data', 'Comparison of permeation with and without OMCs', 'Characterization of hydrogels and OMCs']","The abstract discusses the release profile of ibuprofen from hydrogels containing ordered mesoporous carbons, indicating a relevant study for the dataset.

Compared to monoaxial nanofibers, core-shell nanofibers can control the drug release profile easier, providing sustainable and effective drugs and growth factors for wound healing. However, it is challenging to produce core-shell structured nanofibers with a high production rate at low energy consumption. Co-axial centrifugal spinning is an alternative method to address the above limitations to produce core-shell nanofibers effectively. In this study, a co-axial centrifugal spinning device was designed and assembled to produce core-shell nanofibers for controlling the release rate of ibuprofen and hEGF in inflammation and proliferation phases during the wound healing process. Core-shell structured nanofibers were confirmed by TEM.

However, several factors such as skin, physicochemical properties of the drug, and vehicle characteristics influence the permeation. Within a formulation, critical factors such as concentration of drug, physical state of drug in the formulation, and organoleptic properties affect the flux across the skin. The aim of the study was to develop and investigate topical semisolid preparations (creams and gels) with ibuprofen as the model drug and investigate the effect of various formulation parameters on the in-vitro performance across the Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane using flow-through cells. In addition, the physical stability of the developed formulations was investigated by studying viscosity, pH, and appearance.

The size reduction makes the eutectic formation a viable option to improve the dissolution rate of the poorly soluble APIs. In the present study, ibuprofen, naproxen, and sorafenib were investigated in terms of their phase behaviors with fatty alcohols, such as tetradecanol, octadecanol, and docosanol. Among the studied APIs, only ibuprofen was able to form eutectics with the fatty alcohols, and this was in agreement with the feasibility prediction based on the van 't Hoff equation and solubility parameters. In vitro release behavior was significantly improved for the ibuprofen/octadecanol eutectic mixture, although the practical insolubility of octadecanol in water was the opposite of the outstanding hydrophilicity of usual eutectic formers.

To select safe excipients for nanoemulsion formulation and to discard any haemolytic potential, an in vitro miniaturized test was performed on human whole blood. From haemolysis results obtained on eighteen of the most commonly used excipients, a medium chain triglyceride, a surfactant, and a solubilizer were selected for formulation assays. Based on a design of experiments and a ternary diagram, the feasibility of nanoemulsions was determined. The composition was defined to produce monodisperse nanodroplets with a diameter of either 50 or 120 nm, and their physicochemical properties were optimized to be suitable for intravenous administration. These nanoemulsions, stable over 21 days in storage conditions, were shown to be able to encapsulate with high encapsulation efficiency and high drug loading, up to 16% (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), two water practically insoluble drug models: ibuprofen and fenofibrate. Both drugs may be released according to a modulable profile in sink conditions.

The objective of this study was to produce taste-masked ibuprofen granules using a novel process, twin-screw melt granulation (TSMG). TSMG is an emerging, high-productivity, continuous process. Granules of ibuprofen embedded in a lipid matrix were produced across a range of process conditions, resulting in a range of output granule particle sizes. The ibuprofen appeared to be miscible with the lipid binder though it recrystallized after processing. The ibuprofen melt granules were tested in simulated saliva using a novel, small-volume dissolution technique with continuous acquisition of the ibuprofen concentration. The ibuprofen release from the granules was slower than the neat API and physical blend, beyond the expected residence time of the granules in the mouth. The ibuprofen release was inversely related to the granule size.

These drugs must overcome the skin barrier to cause a therapeutic effect. Human skin has been widely used as a model to study in vitro drug diffusion and permeation, however, it suffers from many limitations. Therefore, to perform in vitro permeation test (IVPT), we used a Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane with diffusion characteristics well-correlated to human skin. This study's objective was to optimize the IVPT conditions using Plackett-Burman experimental design for bio-predictive evaluation of the in vitro permeation rates of five non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, etofenamate, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen) across Strat-M<sup>®</sup> membrane from commercial topical formulations. The Plackett-Burman factorial design was used to screen the effect of seven factors in eight runs with one additional center point. This tool allowed us to set the sensitive and discriminative IVPT final conditions that can appropriately characterize the NSAIDs formulations.

Ibuprofen, tofacitinib citrate, rhodamine B, and lidocaine were loaded into proposomes. These drug formulations were analyzed for particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, and in vitro skin permeation. The confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on skin treated with calcein and rhodamine B laden proposomes. The transdermal delivery relative to physicochemical properties of drugs such as logP, melting point, molecular weight, solubility, etc., were analyzed. We tested the safety of the proposomes using reconstructed human skin tissue equivalents, which were fabricated in-house. We also used human cadaver skin samples as a control. The proposomes had an average diameter of 128 to 148 nm. The drug's entrapment efficiencies were in the range of 42.9-52.7%, translating into the significant enhancement of drug permeation through the skin. The enhancement ratio was 1.4 to 4.0, and linearly correlated to logP, molecular weight, and melting point. Confocal imaging also showed higher skin permeation of calcein and rhodamine B in proposome than in solution. The proposome was found safe for skin application. The enhancement of skin delivery of drugs through proposomes was dependent on the lipophilicity of the drug.

In fact, their extremely high exposed surface area and pore volume allow to load and the release of several drugs, while their framework can be enriched with specific therapeutic ions allowing to boost the tissue regeneration. However, due to the open and easily accessible mesopore structure of MBG, the release of the incorporated therapeutic molecules shows an initial burst effect leading to unsuitable release kinetics. Hence, a still open challenge in the design of drug delivery systems based on MBGs is the control of their release behavior. In this work, Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of polyelectrolyte multi-layers was exploited as a powerful and versatile technique for coating the surface of Cu-substituted MBG nanoparticles with innovative multifunctional drug delivery systems for co-releasing of therapeutic copper ions (exerting pro-angiogenic and anti-bacterial effects) and an anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen). Two different routes were investigated: in the first strategy, chitosan and alginate were assembled by forming the multi-layered surface, and, successively, ibuprofen was loaded by incipient wetness impregnation, while in the second approach, alginate was replaced by ibuprofen, introduced as polyelectrolyte layer. Zeta-potential, TGA and FT-IR spectroscopy were measured after the addition of each polyelectrolyte layer, confirming the occurrence of the stepwise deposition. In addition, the in vitro bioactivity and the ability to modulate the release of the cargo were evaluated. The polyelectrolyte coated-MBGs were proved to retain the peculiar ability to induce hydroxyapatite formation after 7 days of soaking in Simulated Body Fluid. Both copper ions and ibuprofen were co-released over time, showing a sustained release profile up to 14 days and 24 h, respectively, with a significantly lower burst release compared to the bare MBG particles.",2021,,"Pontremoli C, Pagani M, Maddalena L, Carosio F, Vitale-Brovarone C, Fiorilli S.",https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13111952,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,yes,both,yes,yes,uncertain,"['Specific experimental methods for diffusion testing', 'Details on the formulation of ibuprofen', 'Quantitative data on permation rates']","This study involves ibuprofen's release from mesoporous bioactive glasses, pertinent to diffusion research.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been utilised to enhance the nanogels' loading ability towards poorly soluble drugs and promote/sustain drug release. However, formation of CD-based nanogels requires the use of specially modified CDs, or of crosslinking agents. The aim of this work was to develop a CD-based nanogel to improve the cutaneous delivery of ibuprofen by using the soluble β-cyclodextrin/epichlorohydrin polymer (EPIβCD) without adding any potentially toxic crosslinker. The use of EPIβCD enabled increasing ibuprofen loading due to its complexing/solubilizing power towards the poorly soluble drug and prolonging drug release over time due to the nanogel formation. DLS analysis proved that EPIβCD allowed the formation of nanostructures ranging from 60 up to 400 nm, depending on the gelling agent type and the gel preparation method. EPIβCD replacement with monomeric HPβCD did not lead in any case to nanogel formation. Permeation experiments using skin-simulating artificial membranes proved that the EPIβCD-based nanogel enhanced ibuprofen solubility and release, increasing its permeation rate up to 3.5 times, compared to a reference formulation without CD and to some commercial gel formulations, and also assured a sustained release. Moreover, EPIβCD replacement with HPβCD led to a marked increase in drug solubility and initial release rate, but did not provide a prolonged release due to the lack of a nano-matrix structure controlling drug diffusion.",2022,,"Cirri M, Nerli G, Mennini N, Maestrelli F, Mura P.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/12/2567/pdf?version=1669189115,"(TITLE:""ibuprofen"" OR ABSTRACT:""ibuprofen"") AND (permeation OR permeat* OR diffusion OR ""in vitro"" OR release) AND (skin OR membrane OR topical OR transdermal OR ""diffusion cell"")",now,no,IVRT,yes,yes,skin,"['Details on formulations used', 'Specifics of permeability measurements', 'Data on release rates and duration', 'Comparative analysis with other formulations']","The study focuses on enhancing ibuprofen delivery using a novel nanogel system and presents measurable permeation data, which is crucial for the dataset.

Due to their ordered structure and additional secondary porosity, they have aroused great interest among scientists in recent years. Therefore, the present work concerns the synthesis and characterization of hierarchical zeolites with secondary mesoporosity, based on commercial zeolites such as MFI (ZSM-5), BEA (β) and FAU (Y), and modified with polysaccharides such as inulin, hyaluronic acid, and heparin. All materials were characterized by various analytical techniques and applied as a platform for delivery of selected drug molecules. On the basis of X-ray diffraction (presence of reflections in the 2θ angle range of 1.5-2.5°) and low-temperature nitrogen sorption isotherms (mixture of isotherms of I and IV type) additional secondary porosity was found in the mesopore range. Additional tests were also conducted to determine the possibility of loading selected molecules with biological activity into the aforementioned materials and then releasing them in the therapeutic process. Molecules with different therapeutic options were selected for testing, namely ibuprofen, curcumin, and ferulic acid with anti-inflammatory, potentially anticancer, antioxidant, and skin discoloration activities, respectively.

After the initial screening of the IBU solubility in aqueous media, a BBD protocol was implemented, and the optimized formulation displayed appropriate physicochemical properties for skin delivery. By comparing the optimized transfersomes to equivalent liposomes, the incorporation of mixed edge activators was found to be beneficial to upgrade the storage stability of the nanosystems.

In this study, GO membranes were prepared through filtration by a pressure-assisted self-assembly method involving the cross-linking of three diamine monomers on a polyethersulfone (PES) support. The different small molecular diamines, ethylenediamine, butanediamine, and p-phenylenediamine, were introduced as cross-linking agents to investigate the effect of diamine on the properties of GO membranes. The hydrophobic substances ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and triclosan were selected as target pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The adsorption and molecular sieving activities of PPCPs by cross-linked GO membranes at a pH of 3 were investigated. The permeate water was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm, molecular weight distribution, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. The results showed that the removal of hydrophobic PPCPs by GO membranes was mainly due to their adsorption and molecular sieving activities. Adsorption was mainly determined by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the membranes and PPCPs. The interception effect was mainly determined by the interlayer spacing between the GO membranes and the molecular weight and steric hindrance of the PPCPs.

Biodegradable coatings based on poly(lactic acid-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid), PLGA, represent versatile and safe candidates for surface modification of implantable biomaterials and devices, providing additional tunable ability for topical delivery of desired therapeutic agents. In the present study, Ibuprofen-loaded PLGA coatings (PLGA/IBUP) were obtained by using the dip-coating and drop-casting combined protocol. The composite materials demonstrated long-term drug release under biologically simulated dynamic conditions. Reversible swelling phenomena of polymeric coatings occurred in the first two weeks of testing, accompanied by the gradual matrix degradation and slow release of the therapeutic agent. Irreversible degradation of PLGA coatings occurred after one month, due to copolymer's hydrolysis (evidenced by chemical and structural modifications). After 30 days of dynamic testing, the cumulative release of IBUP was ~250 µg/mL. Excellent cytocompatibility was revealed on human-derived macrophages, fibroblasts and keratinocytes.

As a polymer matrix Eudragit EPO (E-EPO) and as an API ibuprofen (IBU) were used in the research. In addition, the plasticizer Compritol 888 ATO (COM) was tested as a factor potentially improving processing parameters and modifying the IBU release profile. In studies, 25% by weight of IBU, 10% of COM and various extrusion temperatures, i.e., 90, 100, 120, 130, and 140 °C, were used. Hot melt extrusion (HME) temperatures were selected based on the glass transition temperature of the polymer matrix (T<sub>g</sub> = 42 °C) and the melting points of IBU (T<sub>m</sub> = 76 °C) and COM (T<sub>m</sub> = 73 °C), which were tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal stability of the tested compounds, determined on the basis of measurements carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), was also taken into account. HME resulted in amorphous E-EPO/IBU solid dispersions and solid dispersions containing a partially crystalline plasticizer in the case of E-EPO/IBU/COM extrudates. Interactions between the components of the extrudate were also studied using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR). The occurrence of such interactions in the studied system, which improve the stability of the obtained solid polymer dispersions, was confirmed.

In this study, blend fibers of polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) at various compositions were electrospun from 10 wt% of polymer solutions to encapsulate a model drug of ibuprofen (IBP). The results showed that the average polymer solution viscosities determined the electrospinning parameters and the resulting average fiber diameters. Increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers decreased the average elastic moduli, the average tensile strength, and the average fracture strains, where IBP exhibited a plasticizing effect in the blend PCL/PEO fibers. Increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers promoted the surface wettability of the fibers. The in vitro release of IBP suggested a transition from a gradual release to a fast release when increasing PEO contents in the blend PCL/PEO fibers up to 120 min. The in vitro viability of blend PCL/PEO fibers using MTT assays showed that the fibers were compatible with MEF-3T3 fibroblasts.
