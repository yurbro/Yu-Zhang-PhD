  A curated, evidence-linked dataset of in vitro permeation/release studies of ibuprofen 5% w/w using Franz diffusion cells.
  Records include final-time cumulative amount endpoints with explicit sampling time, extracted from full-text PDFs using an LLM-assisted pipeline
  with verification and optional figure digitization.
